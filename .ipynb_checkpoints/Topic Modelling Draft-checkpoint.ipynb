      "Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok): Mr Chairman, Sir, I beg leave to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head P of the Estimates be reduced by $100\".\n",
      "On 18 February 2023, the Operation Lionheart contingent of SCDF, comprising 68 officers, which included two Full-time National Servicemen doctors, and four canines returned home after being deployed in Türkiye for search and rescue operations. This followed the devastating earthquake that has to-date killed more than 50,000 people in the region.  \n",
      "Our officers under the command of Col Chew Keng Tok, were activated to fly to Türkiye at short notice. There for 10 days, they operated in very difficult conditions. They had to contend with freezing temperatures, the ever-present threat of further collapse of buildings and the calamitous security situation. In fact, rescue officers from several other countries suspended their operations owing to the prevailing security situation. Despite these challenges, our officers persisted. They saved lives, comforted many and brought honour to our country.  \n",
      " That our officers were able to execute their duties in such a way as to win the admiration of the Turkish people is a testimony to their sterling standard of training and preparedness, strong sense of duty and purpose, excellent leadership and high morale.  \n",
      "Sir, I am sure all hon Members of this House will join me thanking our SCDF officers as well as that of their family members for their courage, and their spirit of sacrifice, in the name of our country. [Applause.]\n",
      "From the reports that I have read, I note that our SCDF officers' work was enabled by the technology of our Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) equipment such as fibre-optic scopes to detect lives.  \n",
      "It is clear to me that technology has and will continue to play an increasingly important role in securing better outcomes in operations. There are a number of factors that drive this including the reality that our Home Team's manpower is likely to remain lean and the likelihood that our Singaporeans will constantly expect more of the Home Team over time. We must, in short, do more with less.  \n",
      "Over the years, the Home Team has invested heavily on technology. For instance, ICA officers leverage on video analytics and live tracking technology to maintain security at the Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints. The Singapore Prison Service is trialling an unmanned and automated urine collection and screening system for its prison inmates.\n",
      " Whilst it is correct that we in the House support the Home Team's investment in technology to achieve operational efficiencies, we also need to be able to gauge the effectiveness of investments. I therefore wish to ask the hon Minister the following questions: \n",
      " How much has the Home Team invested in technological solutions in the past five years? What has been the tangible returns from these investments? What lessons have been drawn? And what would be the framework under which further investments will be made?  \n",
      "I also wish to understand how the Home Team Science and Technology Agency, set up in 2019, has aided the development of cost-effective science and technological capabilities for our Home Team operations. \n",
      "In addition, I wish to better understand how the Police's effectiveness is being measured. \n",
      "Several decades back, the Police relied on the prevalence of the five preventable crimes as a measure of its effectiveness.  \n",
      "Over time, these KPIs became less relevant with the emergence of new kinds of crime such as internet-based scams.  \n",
      "I had previously suggested that the Police publish how much it has seized pursuant to criminal investigations and how much is returned to victims of crime as a KPI. This is done in the UK.\n",
      "The hon Minister informed that his Ministry does not track such data. I seek a review, as just a few days ago, the hon Minister of State announced in this House that over a five-month period in 2022, virtual assets amounting to $172.8 million were seized. Hence, it appears to me that there is an ability to track such data.\n",
      "As I alluded to in my preceding paragraphs, even as I speak about the need for technology, I also see that there remains an irreducible human dimension in keeping Singapore safe and secure. We must ensure that our investment in developing our Home Team's human capital is kept in tandem too. What is the hon Minister's plan in this regard?  \n",
      "I now turn to Singapore's security situation. It seems to me, by reference to the increasing number of recent cases of young persons being self-radicalised through access to harmful online content, that there is a case to take a relook at the legislative levers to ensure that our Home Team officers, particularly the Internal Security Department (ISD) have the tools to prevent the proliferation of such cases. Otherwise, the impact on Singapore can be significant and severe.  \n",
      "We should remind ourselves that terrorists need only be successful once. ISD, on the other hand, has to be successful all the time. In 2022, it was announced in this House that the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) will develop a framework that will tackle online criminal activity, including content inciting violence in our community, to complement the current legislative measures. I seek an update on this matter, please.  \n",
      "Let me now turn to the situation in our prisons. I commend the Singapore Prison Services (SPS) for spearheading efforts with its stakeholders to keep the recividism rate amongst desisters relatively low and stable. The five-year recividism rate of 39.9%, which I believe is being released for the first time this year, is an encouraging statistic even though there is a slight increase in the two-year recividism rate by 0.4% to 20.4%.  \n",
      "I was glad to note that the Government has announced in Budget 2023 the Uplifting Employment Credit (UEC) for companies to employ desisters. This was something I pushed for in this House when I suggested that the Jobs Growth Incentive for ex-offenders to help them during the COVID-19 pandemic be turned into a permanent scheme.  \n",
      "I think, from the experience of the JGI and the steps taken by SPS, we have an opportunity to aim for even lower recividism rates.  \n",
      "The Government's UEC creates an important incentive for employers to seriously consider investing in our desisters. In turn, by gainfully employed in good jobs that have good prospects, it gives our desisters the best chance to break free from their past.  \n",
      "To effect permanent changes, we have to start with the individual and work with their families too. This will not be easy but has to be done. I understand that SPS has, over the years, built a substantial number of volunteers who are roped in to help with reintegration support for prison inmates and desisters. I believe that there is a case for SPS and its volunteers to partner the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), Ministry of National Development (MND) and other Government agencies to co-create bespoke plans for each desister that has a series of incentives and disincentives during the supervision period of desisters. The purpose is to motivate desisters to be responsible family members and encourage reconciliation within their families. I truly believe that once our desisters are accepted back and reconciled with their families, the sky will be the limit for them.  \n",
      " As a broader point, our community must play its part to encourage our desisters to make strong contributions to their families and enrich the Singapore's story. They have talent, knowledge and experience which Singapore can benefit from. We need to get behind them and signal to them that we will support them so long as they keep on the path of rehabilitation and reintegration. Early last year, I suggested in this House that our desisters be given an opportunity to perform at our National Day Parade. Having seen them perform, I know that they will be a hit amongst Singaporeans. I understood that my suggestion was made too late for National Day Parade (NDP) 2022. I wonder whether it was in time for NDP 2023 instead.  \n",
      "May I ask what strategies SPS will employ to leverage on the UEC, to help desisters overcome real-life challenges and lead crime-free lives? What is the permanent employment rate amongst our desisters? What would be the realistic stretch target for us to achieve in the years to come?  \n",
      "We also need to pay special attention to desisters with drug-abusing pasts. I understand that this is the group of persons who are more likely to re-offend as they struggle to steer clear from triggers that make them consume drugs in the first place. May I ask what new measures, if any, that SPS and the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) are proposing to deal with this admittedly intractable issue?  \n",
      "Mr Chairman, Sir, I have spoken on what I see to be the three elements of securing Singapore for the future. Courage is beyond price, but technology and developing the talents of our men and women in the Home Team, these require constant investments and our continued support. I look forward to hearing from the Minister and her colleagues on the issues that I have raised.\n",
      "Question proposed. \n",
      "New Citizen Selection Criteria\n",
      "Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied): Chairman, new citizens are going to be even more important to the future of Singapore. With our total fertility rate at the historical low of 1.05, it will not be hyperbole to say new citizens are a critical pillar in the shape of any future Singapore. \n",
      "In line with the Government's Forward Singapore exercise that promises a renewed social compact with citizens, we need to ask what should Singapore's goals be when bringing in new citizens? \n",
      "We want those who truly know Singapore and want to embrace the Singapore way of life. We want those who really want to live here and be here. We want people who have already proven themselves by having integrated into Singapore life after some time as Permanent Residents.\n",
      "Singaporeans do not want new citizens who do not want to live here but only want the power of the Singapore passport for their convenience and the safe and secure environment for their assets and wealth. We do not want new citizens who are reluctant for their sons to do National Service and, certainly, none of us want people who only want Singapore Citizenship as a stepping-stone to another country but, instead, seek those who have a long-term commitment to Singapore.\n",
      "Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong has promised that Forward Singapore will move on to looking at solutions.\n",
      "The Swiss, for example, have a highly specific selection process for new citizens. People must show deep commitment before granted Swiss citizenship through naturalisation. Applicants must show themselves to be successfully integrated into Switzerland and know Swiss ways and customs. \n",
      "For ordinary naturalisation, a person must have lived in Switzerland for 10 years and hold a permanent residence permit. The Swiss Naturalisation Authorities summoned applicants for a personal interview which focuses on their knowledge of Switzerland. They must be able to answer questions on Swiss geography, history, politics and society.\n",
      "Do we have similar requirements? For example, the latest Singapore Census 2020 revealed that 48.3% of the resident population in Singapore spoke English most frequently at home compared to 32.3% a mere 10 years ago. Is the working proficiency in English a criterion for citizenship for better integration between new citizens and Singaporeans of all races and religion, since English is our main language of communication?\n",
      "Can the Government share more details on how new citizenships are granted as there are aspects of the process and criteria currently that are opaque? How is our system different from that of the Swiss? Is there already a point system in place and what does it consider apart from the publicly revealed criteria, such as economic contribution, educational qualification, family profile and length of stay in Singapore?\n",
      "Most importantly, how will the citizenship selection process evolve in face of the Forward Singapore exercise and a review of the social compact?\n",
      "Legislation for Online Criminal Activity\n",
      "Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang): Chairman, cybercrime is a broad area. The police have described the two categories as cyber-enabled offences and cyber dependent offences. Cyber dependent offences are those where digital assets are the target and include hacking, ransomware and website defacements. These of these offences are covered by the Computer Misuse Act.\n",
      "On the other hand, cyber-enabled crimes relate to crimes that are facilitated by the computer and include the wide range of scams, cyber-harassment, cyber-extortion and illegal online gambling. These are currently covered by different pieces of legislation, including the Penal Code and the Protection from Harassment Act.\n",
      "Both areas seem to have been growing. In relation to cyber dependent crimes, a total of 1.8 million web threats against Internet users were detected and blocked in Singapore between April and June 2022 according to data obtained from Kaspersky Security Network, and this was a 17.6% rise from the previous year.  \n",
      "On cyber-enabled crimes, The Straits Times reported that around $661 million was lost to online scams in 2022. While there are a wide range of tools that are needed to deal with such crimes, legislation is obviously an important component. Does MHA see any gaps in the existing legislative framework to deal with cybercrime?\n",
      "3.30 pm\n",
      "At the Committee of Supply debate in 2022, MHA mentioned that it was working on a framework to deal with a broad suite of online criminal activity. How will this framework relate to the existing legislation?\n",
      "The Chairman: Mr Christopher de Souza, both cuts please.\n",
      "Home Team Transformation – Technology\n",
      "Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah): Sir, as a result of technological advancements, the threat of crime is considerably more global than ever and certainly does not respect boundaries. We need to continually strengthen our technological capability so as to detect crime, including multi-jurisdictional crimes. What is the Home Team doing to leverage on technology to battle domestic and transnational crime and does this requires some degree of transformation of operations?\n",
      "Home Team Transformation – Manpower\n",
      "MHA fulfils a key function: the maintenance of order and law in Singapore. But with declining birth rates, manpower has been and will continue to be affected. Leveraging on technology, cooperation with MINDEF, partnerships with international organisations such as Interpol and good relationships with police forces in the region are key to making up for the reducing pool of local manpower.\n",
      "But in the round, manpower is still key. Ground, human judgement is key in ground ops and therefore how will MHA transform itself to ensure: one, that our officers continue to be world-class; and two, that our world-class officers work alongside best-in-class technology to assist in the fight against crime?\n",
      "Youth Radicalisation\n",
      "Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang): In Malay, Sir.\n",
      "(In Malay): [Please refer to Vernacular Speech.] We have seen more cases of youth radicalisation recently and they are getting younger. \n",
      "Just a few weeks ago, we were shocked with reports of two Singaporean teenagers being issued orders under ISA for terrorism-related activities. One of them, a 15-year old teenager, is the youngest person to be dealt with under ISA. The teenagers were contacts of another self-radicalised 18-year old, who was also detained by ISD last December.\n",
      "Although they were self-radicalised separately, they subsequently became acquainted online. The teenagers joined multiple extremist-themed servers on online gaming platform Roblox. Such online gaming platforms are being used by extremist groups to disseminate their ideological beliefs. They use video games and gaming culture to attract and influence our youths. We need to keep abreast of the technological developments and current societal trends to prevent terrorists from abusing such online platforms to spread extremist ideologies that prey on the minds of our youth.\n",
      "Can MHA provide an update on how it intends to tackle this trend?\n",
      "The Chairman: Mr Christopher de Souza. You can take your three cuts, please.\n",
      "Home Team Transformation – Anti-terror\n",
      "Mr Christopher de Souza: With the threat of self-radicalisation becoming more apparent in Singapore and around the region, stepping up our efforts in countering the threat of terrorism is key. We need to continually strengthen our regulatory framework and our detection capabilities so as to keep a close watch on potential terror situations or threats.\n",
      "How will MHA continue to partner with other states in our fight against terror, given the fight is not one that exists in vacuum? Further, how is the Home Team transforming its operational capabilities such as to prevent terrorist financing and to prevent money laundering in relation to terrorism?\n",
      "Fight Against Tolerance to Drugs\n",
      "Sir, Singapore has had a long and hard stance against drugs. It has benefited our nation. However, there is a gradually growing perception that drugs are less harmful or not harmful if used just socially. But it is obvious that experimental drug use can lead to addiction.\n",
      "How does MHA intend to reinvent and transform its engagements and messages regarding the growing tolerance to drugs? In particular, how will MHA explain that the liberalisation of recreational drug use in other countries, including some in the region, will in every likelihood lead to massive long-term societal harm? Such brutally honest messaging could achieve the deterrent effect needed to puncture the growing tolerance to drugs.\n",
      "The Battle Against the Lure of Cannabis\n",
      "Sir, Singapore is seeing a rise among younger members of society in terms of usage of cannabis. Youth form a significant proportion of new abusers of illicit drugs. We need to continue and readily impart drug-free values to the next generation and educate and inculcate the understanding that addiction is not without consequences. Families can be torn apart by addiction and what more, widespread addiction can lead to devastating consequences on our society as a whole.\n",
      "How does MHA intend to ramp up its engagement of our youths regarding the dangers of drug abuse, especially in the light of the growing and dangerous lure of cannabis?\n",
      "Prevention of Drug Abuse\n",
      "Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio): Chairman, I support our zero-tolerance stance against drugs. Unfortunately, as some other countries resort to legalising and decriminalising drugs, such a liberal attitude towards narcotics has been spreading through social media and other channels. This may have an impact on certain segments of our society including some youths. How will MHA proceed with its efforts to prevent drug abuse?\n",
      "Drug Offences Recidivism\n",
      "Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member): Sir, the Singapore Prison Service recently released statistics of the drug offences recidivism rates. Both the two-year recidivism rate at 26.1% and the five-year recidivism rate at 45.2%, were up. Separately, the consistently higher five-year rates point to the fact that over the longer term, the chances of re-offending are higher. This could be because former offenders are more likely to fall in with bad company and into their old ways once Government support tapers off.\n",
      "Yellow Ribbon Singapore (YRSG) looks at rebuilding the lives of former inmates and ex-offenders through skills and career development. There are excellent programmes like training even before an inmate is released and career coaching. Could the Minister elaborate on MHA and YRSG's plans in the coming year for programmes specifically targeting the two- to five-year period after an ex-offender for drug offences has been released? It appears from the statistics that this is an important period to have ongoing programmes.\n",
      "Furthermore, recidivism should be tackled not only through helping ex-offenders get jobs but through community support as well. I would like to ask whether the Ministry will consider expanding the role of YRSG to cover holistic rehabilitation of ex-offenders beyond skills and career development, and that will empower YRSG to also be somewhat of a coordinating body for all the various efforts by various Government bodies to tackle recidivism, including community efforts and long-term programmes up to and even beyond five years.\n",
      "YRSG held its second CARE Network Summit in 2022. Could I ask the Minister to elaborate on what outcomes from that summit will implemented by YRSG this year or that it is considering? How will community groups and employers be involved?\n",
      "I would also like to ask, Sir, how YRSG actively reaches out and provides support to families of offenders and ex-offenders, and could the Minister elaborate on YRSG's plans for this year in this area?\n",
      "Drug laws, Sir, has been liberalised in many countries, including neighbouring countries. Could I ask the Minister how would the Government ameliorate the effect of a stepped-up anti-drug campaign on ex-offenders such that we do not see a resurgence of stigmatisation?\n",
      "Recidivism and Reintegration\n",
      "Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim: Sir, Singapore's two-year recidivism rates are not only the lowest in the world but also our lowest in 30 years. As a Board Member of YRSG, I am proud of all the efforts made by the entire ecosystem of support from the Singapore Prison Service (SPS), MHA, community partners and employers to assist us in the reintegration effort.\n",
      "As mentioned in my Committee of Supply speech last year, we need \"offenders\" to become \"overcomers\" – overcoming the challenges in life in a whole-of-society approach. I welcome that SPS now use the term \"desistors\" which helps to remove the stigma of incarceration.\n",
      "While the numbers are good, we cannot rest on our laurels. We should tackle long-term recidivism rates on a five-year period horizon. How does MHA intend to further reduce the long-term recidivism rates of ex-offenders?\n",
      "The Chairman: Mr Christopher de Souza. Both cuts, please.\n",
      "Acceptance of Ex-offenders\n",
      "Mr Christopher de Souza: Sir, many former offenders find themselves to be the target of the invisible bars of prejudice and suspicion, making their process of rehabilitation and reintegration into society that much more challenging. By raising more awareness to accept former offenders as fellow and equal members of society, we can generate greater public support which could translate into a greater number of volunteers for the Community Action for the Rehabilitation of Ex-offenders (CARE) Network, the Yellow Ribbon Project and other aftercare programmes. How is MHA creating awareness and generating acceptance for our former offenders in order to facilitate their transition and welcoming back into society?\n",
      "Mentorship Programmes for Ex-offenders\n",
      "Sir, we must make a concerted effort to welcome former offenders into our society after their release. Such a welcoming attitude will also reduce the chance of re-offending and possibly even heal families. In the road to recovery and reintegration, mentorship is key. How can MHA and the Singapore Prison Service continue to enhance the provision of post-release mentorship schemes for our former offenders?\n",
      "Employability of Ex-offenders\n",
      "Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong): Chairman, I have met Clementi residents who are ex-offenders. Some were in prison for many years, and upon release find that the job market has changed from the days before. Some are older, having been in and out of incarceration and now are dealing with health conditions even as they are trying to find work. Finding work, finding a job – it is part of the recovery journey, the rehabilitation journey, rebuilding a life while coming back into society.\n",
      "What is MHA doing to improve the employability of ex-offenders who are rebuilding their lives and how are we recognising employers who are inclusive, employers who lean in to give someone that second chance in life?\n",
      "Yellow Ribbon and Criminal Records\n",
      "Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer): As part of our #EveryWorkerMatters conversation exercise last month, together with my NTUC colleagues and volunteers, I had the great opportunity to host a dialogue session at our NTUC premises for more than 100 employers, ex-offenders, Yellow Ribbon Singapore, Singapore Prison Service and New Charis Mission friends. This is the first time that NTUC and Labour Movement has engaged this community for a dialogue.\n",
      "On another occasion earlier this month, my team and I had an opportunity to engage a group of inmates at Changi Prison as part of our #EveryWorkerMatters conversation to share as well as hear their thoughts on jobs, training, skills and employment and employability in general.\n",
      "I applaud the work of Yellow Ribbon Singapore and Singapore Prison Service and for making our engagement possible so that we can hear first-hand from the community as we forge a new workers' compact.\n",
      "As much as it was happy to hear some employers leaning forward to help and hire ex-offenders, we hear the fears and anxieties from the inmates who are soon to be released and wanting to re-integrate back into society as well as find decent work when they are out.\n",
      "In this respect, I wish to make three points.\n",
      "First, I wish to know what is being done thus far and the plans of Singapore Prison Service and Yellow Ribbon Singapore in this important space to help in the employment and employability needs of ex-offenders.\n",
      "Second, I hope that MHA will consider reviewing the Registration of Criminals Act in the treatment and type of offences that are spent including the duration of the past offence before a criminal record is spent. This area has not been reviewed for a long time and I hope the review will be able to give ex-offenders a higher chance of employment and employability when they re-enter into the workforce and society.\n",
      "3.45 pm\n",
      "Third, taking off my interaction with the community, I suggest that MHA give more support for halfway houses and shelters specially catered for women, including those run by charities, NGOs and religious organisations.\n",
      "Collaboration with Malay/Muslim Community\n",
      "Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim: Sir, in Malay.\n",
      "(In Malay): [Please refer to Vernacular Speech.] The number of new Malay drug abusers arrested has decreased by 21% in 2022 compared to the previous year. In 2021, the number of Malay drug offenders arrested dropped by 15%; compared to other communities who declined by 7%. \n",
      "This statistic shows that efforts by CNB and our community, through the close cooperation of the Dadah Is Haram Campaign, M3 and other Malay/Muslim bodies, have yielded results.\n",
      "Our Malay/Muslim community has also greatly supported the Dadah Is Haram Campaign through a network of more than 70 mosques throughout Singapore and volunteers. Apart from that, the FITRAH program by M3 and our Malay/Muslim Organisations Rehabilitation Network have also helped to combat the scourge of drugs and its impact on our community.\n",
      "Chairman, therefore, I would like to ask what is MHA's plan to continue working with our Malay/Muslim community to help offenders and ex-offenders within our community?\n",
      "Regularising Security Officer Work Hours\n",
      "Mr Raj Joshua Thomas: Sir, security officer working hours in both private and Government contracts are typically 12-hours a day, six days a week. Such working hours are unreasonable and unsustainable.\n",
      "I would like to ask if the Government will take the lead to regularise working hours for security officers in Government security contracts, including to give more weightage at the evaluation stage of outcome-based security contracts, to tender bids that propose shorter working hours for security officers. Let us ensure that our security officers are not left behind in all this talk of work-life balance.\n",
      "The Chairman: Mr Derrick Goh. Not here. Mr Sitoh Yih Pin.\n",
      "The Threat of Scams\n",
      "Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir): Mr Chairman, the recent statistics that were released by the Police on scams released has surely captured our attention on the threat that scams are causing in the community. That the Police released this set of statistics separate and distinct from other crime numbers for the first time, shows that scams are fast becoming a major cause of concern.  \n",
      "The numbers are quite astounding. Year on year, the total amount reported to have been cheated from all scams rose from $632 million in 2021 to $660.7 million in 2022. The number of scams and cybercrime cases increased by about 25%, from 26,886 in 2021, to 33,669 in 2022. \n",
      "And for those of us who think that seniors are generally the vulnerable class in society that are more susceptible to being scammed, we know that the cases involving seniors only amount to 8.8% of all cases. A whopping 79.4% of cases involved individuals from the ages of 10 to 49 years of age.\n",
      "Anecdotally, I am sure all of us have heard of many stories of scams. As representatives in this House, we will also have met many residents who have sought our assistance when scammed. \n",
      "Not so long ago, I remember that the concern was mainly about phishing links, sent by emails, digital messages or on social media. Raising awareness on such modus operandi was easier. We warned one another not to click on links immediately, to always question and verify before proceeding.  \n",
      "Scams have evolved quite significantly since then. There are now scams that appear to be innocuous but end up being most insidious. Scammers masquerade as love interests, friends who have changed numbers and are in need of assistance or even promise what appeared to be legitimate jobs but end up cheating, oftentimes, life savings of individuals. Some scams even play the long game for many months, slowly cheating not only money, but also causing great emotional turmoil to its victims.     \n",
      "Perhaps, what is the most alarming about scams, is the fact that it is often the case that these scams originate from overseas and once money is transferred to another account, it promptly leaves our shores and jurisdiction almost instantaneously. This makes the task of the Police, no matter how well-trained and determined they are, all the more challenging in arresting scammers and especially in their efforts to retrieve the stolen monies for the victims.  \n",
      "Given the insidious threat of scams and the disproportionate harm it brings to its victims, I hope that the Government will take steps to augment its support of the Police, by legislation or otherwise, work with industry partners, such as our financial institutions and other stakeholders in the process to combat scams and protect the community.  \n",
      "In the premise, I invite the Minister to share with this House, the steps that the Government is taking to address the threat of scams in the community, whether the Ministry has plans to strengthen legislation to combat scams and the efforts that are being made to educate and keep the public informed of the latest developments so that Singaporeans can take the necessary precautions against scams.\n",
      "Support for Scam Victims\n",
      "Dr Shahira Abdullah (Nominated Member): Chairman, scam victims suffer more than just financial losses. It often takes a toll on them physically, mentally, and socially. Many may be too embarrassed to seek help. Victims feel anxiety, shame and helplessness, and a variety of other emotions which may lead to depression, tension and stress. The deep shame may also prevent these victims from seeking help. They may also engage in self-harm or turn suicidal.\n",
      "The Anti-Scam Centre was set up last year as a collaboration between Singapore Police Force (SPF) and six banks. Building on that, could I also suggest having a one-stop unit that collaborates with relevant agencies and professionals dedicated to assisting scam victims amid a scam or after they have fallen prey to the scam? This unit could ensure that vulnerable groups, such as the deaf, who may not be able to utilise the phone hotlines can get timely help. Post-scam, frontline officers from the Police or banks could refer victims to this \"Post-Scam\" Unit to better address their financial and mental needs promptly.\n",
      "Financially, the unit can assess the victim's financial needs, provide information about financial support services and refer the victim to relevant social service agencies. Emotionally, the Post-Scam Unit would be equipped to assess their mental health needs and provide immediate emotional support, if needed, to prevent further deterioration in their mental well-being. The unit can then refer the victim to follow-up mental health services and support groups.\n",
      "Finally, the unit can follow up with the victim after the initial report to check on their well-being and provide additional support if needed. They can also provide updates on the status of the investigation and any support services that may be available to the victim.\n",
      "The Chairman: Mr Christopher de Souza, you can take your four cuts, please.\n",
      "Online Scams – Shutting Mule Accounts\n",
      "Mr Christopher de Souza: Sir, money mule accounts are a serious issue and the impending changing the law is good. Laws need to be regularly reviewed to respond to the fast-evolving nature of the scams.\n",
      "There needs to be sufficient flexibility within the legislation and subsidiary legislation. People are being lured by easy money to sell their Singpass details and bank accounts for purposes, such as money laundering, facilitating unauthorised access to computer material and carrying out unlicensed businesses.\n",
      "How is MHA aiming to reduce the prevalence of money mule accounts and lower the incidence of people selling their personal details and bank accounts?\n",
      "Combatting Online Scams Using Technology\n",
      "Sir, scammers are getting increasingly diverse in the forms of scams that they are able to carry out with the use of new technology, AI and over the Internet. To build a strong digital infrastructure to prevent scams, we need to utilise technology, such as big data, to be able to spot common patterns, to highlight suspicious transactions and websites with scammers spoofing e-commerce platforms, fake friend call scams and impersonation scams.\n",
      "How is MHA using technology and partnering with various stakeholders to further flag out suspicious transactions for our digital infrastructure needs to develop to put up more barriers and warnings against phishing and other forms of data theft?\n",
      "Multi-pronged Way to Fight Online Scams\n",
      "Sir, a collective multi-pronged approach to fight scams is necessary, given the nature of online scans. This includes not just Government agencies and banks, but telcos customers and consumers and the community at large.\n",
      "How is the Government working in tandem with the various sectors in order to develop specific and targeted approaches to dealing with different sorts of scams particularly, because scams evolve quickly? What infrastructure is in place to respond to new forms of scams across the various industries, such that all stakeholders are informed and play their part in collectively combatting the threat?\n",
      "Raising Awareness to Deter Online Scams\n",
      "Sir, we need a strong public awareness regarding the nature of scams and the various forms they take.\n",
      "In recent years, there has been a proliferation of scams, including e-commerce scams, Internet love scams and investment scams. These scams are particularly difficult to track and counter because these deal with daily life and, to some extent, human sentiment and human emotion.\n",
      "Given how fast scams can evolve and new scams can appear, we need to be able to quickly inform the public, especially the targeted groups that are most vulnerable to a particular form of scam. Increasing public awareness is one key plank.\n",
      "How is the Government working to continually update the public on new forms of scams and keeping up with its public education and awareness efforts?\n",
      "Online Scams\n",
      "Mr Vikram Nair: Chairman, earlier this month, the Police Force released data on cybercrime which was reported by CNA and the figures were sobering. The amount lost to online scams the last two years has been staggering, around $632 million in 2021 and $661 million in 2022.  \n",
      "The total number of cybercrime cases rose by around 25% to 33,669 cases compared to 26,886 cases the year before. Scams accounted for 94.2% of these cases. Of these cybercrime cases, scams accounted for 94%.\n",
      "The top five scam types were phishing scams, job scams, e-commerce scams, investment scams and fake friend call scams. They made up about 80% of the top 10 scams.\n",
      "The largest amounts lost were to investment scams, about $198.8 million, followed by job scams, which caused around $117.4 million in losses. Somewhat surprisingly, at least to me, the largest group of victims were young adults, aged 20 to 39, who made up around 53% of all victims.\n",
      "It is good that the Police is keeping tracks and close tabs on cybercrime data and able to produce such information on the issue. I am interested to know what steps are being taken to combat cybercrime and whether the existing steps are enough. In particular, I wonder whether the Police believe any further steps need to be taken in educating the public better as well as steps that are required to catch and prosecute the perpetrators. \n",
      "Where these perpetrators are abroad, which I believe happens in many of the scams, have we had any success in capturing the perpetrators and/or recovering assets for victims?  \n",
      "The Chairman: Mr Derrick Goh, you can take your earlier cut as well.\n",
      "Concerning Increase in Youth Crimes\n",
      "Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon): Chairman, I mentioned in our Budget debate about the worrying trend we are seeing, where our youths perpetuating crimes is on the increase. \n",
      "On the scams front, SPF reported that majority of those arrested for e-commerce scams were youths. For first half of 2022, almost 60% of arrestees for e-commerce scams were aged below 29.\n",
      "4.00 pm\n",
      "While Singapore has been steadfast also in its zero-tolerance approach towards drugs, even amid more liberal attitudes towards the use of drugs both internationally and in the region, such as in Thailand, CNB has also highlighted a worrying trend of more youths abusing cannabis. \n",
      "While the drug situation in Singapore remains largely curbed, CNB reported that cannabis abusers arrested in 2022 climbed 71% to 236. Worryingly, over 60% of arrestees were aged below 30 and some even as young as 14.\n",
      "This is complicated by the continued emergence of new psychoactive substances and a quadrupling of vaping cases from 2020 to 2022. Such illicit habits appeal more to the youth and could be gateways to other forms of harder substance abuse as well as give rise to other social ills and offences. Moreover, accessibility to these harms is easily facilitated in the digital space, where youths can deal anonymously, which could be challenging for our agencies to detect. \n",
      "What is equally concerning is that in most cases, parents did not seem to be aware of their child's involvement with such harms. Can MHA explain its plans on how it can deepen engagement with all stakeholders in the ecosystem – parents, schools, youth groups, media platforms, and so on to identify at-risk youths for more timely and effective intervention? What further measures will MHA take to address this worrying trend of youth perpetrating crimes? \n",
      "Stepping Up Efforts to Combat Scams\n",
      "Despite the increased and commendable efforts by MHA and its partners, the scourge of scams remains unabated and continues to evolve. 2022 saw both a record 34,000 cases and a loss of well over S$660 million. This means that in the past two years, close to over S$1.3 billion has been lost to scams.\n",
      "A discerning public is our first line of defence. MHA has been strengthening public education efforts, through the ACT Against Scams campaign and by encouraging residents to download the ScamShield app.\n",
      "The Anti-Scam Command has also done well, partnering local banks to freeze more than 16,700 bank accounts and telcos to terminate more than 6,500 lines, thereby preventing a further loss of about S$146 million in 2022. Noteworthy, is the step up in anti-scam enforcements such as the recent islandwide operation in February where over 500 scammers and money mules were arrested.  \n",
      "Unlike physical crimes, scams are perpetrated by highly organised transnational syndicates and conducted swiftly in the digital space; and experts have also spoken about sophisticated operations that are aided by AI. \n",
      "Combatting scams hence requires a concerted \"all-hands-on-deck\" response. MHA should build upon its success to further deepen international co-operation with foreign law enforcement agencies, and partnerships with stakeholders like platform providers, for example, communication and social media firms, as well as e-commerce players in the digital value chain. To be effective, these stakeholders, who themselves benefit and profit from the digital ecosystem, need to do more, and have accountability clearly assigned, to drive more proactive upstream prevention of scams.  \n",
      "This will become important as recent trends show that while the number of scams have increased, the amount lost per transaction is smaller on average. This trend is expected to worsen as frictionless payments increase along with more cross-border linkages, such as the link-up of Singapore's PayNow with Thailand's PromptPay and, as announced last week, India's UPI.\n",
      "We are an international and well-digitalised financial centre. This makes us inevitably prone to cybercrimes. There is a pressing need for us to swiftly and resolutely act against scams to uphold public trust, as the digital world becomes more complex with greater cybersecurity risks.\n",
      "Singapore has often been lauded as one of the safest cities in the world, and we should uphold this standing in the digital sphere too.\n",
      "The Chairman: Minister Josephine Teo. \n",
      "The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo): Mr Chairman, at the outset, let me thank Mr Murali Pillai and Members for their recognition of our SCDF officers as well as the team behind Operation Lionheart. They have done us proud and in a very tragic situation, we are glad that Singapore was able to make a small contribution.\n",
      "Sir, Singapore remains one of the safest countries in the world. Since 2015, we have been ranked first in Gallup's Global Law and Order Report, except in 2021 when the survey was not conducted here due to the pandemic. In the 2022 World Justice Project Rule of Law Index, Singapore was ranked as one of the top three countries in \"order and security\", for the sixth time in a row. \n",
      "These accolades do not mean that we can take our peaceful state of affairs for granted. On the contrary, given the dynamic operating environment, the Home Team is constantly challenged with emerging threats. These include foreign interferences, scams and other cybercrimes, and a more permissive global attitude towards drugs.\n",
      "My MHA colleagues and I will share how we are responding to these challenges, and also address points raised by Members. Minister of State Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim will speak on our efforts to combat drug abuse, including by enhancing our rehabilitation programmes. Minister of State Sun Xueling will speak on our multi-pronged approach to tackle scams. I will speak about online crimes more generally. \n",
      "We have been able to keep our country safe and secure, in large part because the public has placed a high level of trust and confidence in the Home Team, and also do their part to uphold law and order. This compact between Singaporeans and the Home Team is important and extends to the online domain. I spoke at the SNDGG Committee of Supply debate about the digital social compact.\n",
      "Within our security social compact, the Government enacts laws and policies, giving due consideration to all parties who have a stake. We earn the public's trust by enforcing laws in a fair and transparent manner and by consistently delivering good safety and security outcomes. \n",
      "In the online space, the Government does not set out to dictate or curtail the adoption of technology or use of online platforms. However, we have a duty to protect our citizens from online harms, the same way we deal with threats in the physical domain. The measures we take must be reasonable and calibrated. As for the individual, we have a part to play by being alert and vigilant and by looking out for the vulnerable amongst us, who may be more susceptible to crimes carried out online. \n",
      "Mr Murali Pillai, Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim and Mr Vikram Nair asked for an update on legislation to target online criminal harms. Let me share our plan.\n",
      "Online harms are constantly evolving and take various forms. They include falsehoods, foreign interference and inappropriate sexual abuse material. Online mediums are also exploited to incite violence, carry out scams at scale and traffic drugs.\n",
      "There is a growing international consensus for rules to combat online harms. For example, jurisdictions such as the UK, the EU, Germany and Australia have introduced or proposed new laws to regulate the online space. \n",
      "Over the years, the Government has taken steps to deal with different types of harmful online content and behaviours. We introduced the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act and the Foreign Interference Countermeasures Act. The Broadcasting Act was recently amended to deal with harms that impact user safety, such as suicide and self-harm, cyberbullying and content likely to undermine racial and religious harmony. We can also block access to egregious content on online communications services, including social media platforms.\n",
      "But there remain gaps. There is online content which are criminal in their own right, or content which facilitate or abet crimes. These include syndicated crimes such as scams, online incitement of mass public disorder and malicious cyber activities such as phishing and the distribution of malware. We have been monitoring these developments closely and intend to update our suite of legislation to better protect our people.\n",
      "MHA will therefore be introducing the Online Criminal Harms Act later this year. The proposed Online Criminal Harms Act builds on our current laws in three ways.\n",
      "First, it will expand the scope of regulatory levers that we can apply to online criminal activities. This includes powers to stop or remove online communications that would facilitate crimes in the physical world, such as inciting violence. \n",
      "Second, it will increase the scope of entities we can act against. It will cover all mediums of online communication through which criminal activities could be conducted. \n",
      "Third, it will introduce levers that deal more effectively with the nature of online criminal harms. To Mr Derrick Goh's question on how online entities can be involved in prevention and be held more accountable, the new legislation will introduce upstream measures to detect and reduce scams such as safeguards against inauthentic accounts. This legislation will also apply to other malicious cyber activities like phishing.\n",
      "Mr Chairman, MHA continues to monitor closely one specific type of online harm, that of online gambling. As Members know, gambling is prohibited unless licensed or exempted. This applies whether gambling takes place online or physically. \n",
      "In 2022, we amended our gambling legislation to ensure that our laws are up-to-date and able to address emerging trends. This is especially as the lines between gambling and gaming have become blurred.\n",
      "Take the example of video games with loot boxes. They may feature a range of virtual items of value, which a player may win with varying probabilities. We allow games with such loot boxes via a class licensing regime, but only if the game fulfils either of two conditions. The loot box within the game must be entirely free of charge to play. Otherwise, the game must not contain monetisation facilities; meaning that players cannot exchange the virtual prizes for real-world pay-outs, such as money or merchandise. \n",
      "This is a practical and balanced approach. It ensures we safeguard against gambling inducement, rather than gaming. We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of our gambling legislation and update our regulatory approach where needed. \n",
      "Beyond legislation, the Home Team must constantly enhance our capabilities to respond to evolving threats. Mr Murali Pillai asked about the returns from our transformation efforts and how we will make future investments. \n",
      "Over the past five years, an average of about 30% of the Home Team's expenditure has been on capability development, including investing in new technological solutions. We will continue such investments to improve our operations and reduce our reliance on manpower. The results can be seen through how the Home Team has been transforming in four areas: Processes, Platforms, People and Partnerships – four \"Ps\". \n",
      "First, our processes. Over the years, we have used automation and biometrics to make our immigration clearance more efficient. Today, Singaporeans who travel through Changi Airport are familiar with the automated immigration clearance gates. \n",
      "We want to further smoothen clearance processes. Since January 2017, we have implemented 100% automated clearance for all motorcyclists at the land checkpoints. Following successful proof-of-concept trials, ICA and Home Team Science and Technology Agency (HTX) are now working to introduce automated in-car clearance for car travellers. Travellers will remain seated in the car and self-scan their passport and biometrics to verify their identities.\n",
      "4.15 pm\n",
      "With automated clearance, we expect overall faster and more secure clearance for car travellers. It also reduces the manpower demand, which can be deployed to meet other needs.\n",
      "Mr Christopher de Souza asked how technology helped tackle domestic and transnational crime and aid our ground operations.\n",
      "We have invested in new technology platforms such as those that improve incident response. In this regard, the use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) has been a game changer for the Home Team as it provides us with an eye in the sky that supplement ground officers and ground-based cameras. \n",
      "For example, SPF deployed such systems for crowd management at events, including heartland celebrations of the National Day Parade and the year-end countdown in 2022.\n",
      "HTX is further pushing the boundaries by trialling a system that can be operated remotely from a centralised command and control centre. This will allow SPF and SCDF commanders to receive visuals of the scene even before our officers arrive, allowing them to better plan their responses. \n",
      "Technology has also supported our fight against scams, which are crimes that often have a transnational element. Minister of State Sun will provide more details in her speech. \n",
      "The third \"P\" is people. Mr Christopher de Souza rightly pointed out the challenging manpower situation, which is why we have redesigned our training.  \n",
      "For example, our built environment is becoming more complex for our firefighting and rescue operations. \n",
      "The redeveloped Field Training Area at the Civil Defence Academy will host new infrastructure and stimulators that expand our training scenarios in an area nearly the size of three football fields. This will be ready in end 2023.\n",
      "The Home Team must also ensure that we have the specialised talent to enable our use of advanced technology, and Mr Murali Pillai asked how HTX has helped. \n",
      "Beyond consolidating capabilities from across the Home Team, HTX has developed deep expertise in areas ranging from biometrics to robotics and automation that support the Home Team's unique needs. The partnerships which HTX has forged, both with local research institutions and foreign counterparts, has enabled us to be at the forefront of new technological developments.\n",
      "So that it has enough talent, this year, HTX will be ramping up its recruitment and training of fresh Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) graduates from the universities as well as polytechnics. We will also include experienced professionals from the science, engineering and digital technology sectors. The target is to fill a total of 500 positions. \n",
      "Mr Chairman, our stakeholders and the public are ultimately who we serve. Technology has enabled us to enhance the final \"P\" – partnerships that are essential to the Home Team. \n",
      "For example, SCDF's myResponder app has been key to helping to activate Community First Responders (CFRs), who are members of the public, to provide immediate assistance before our officers arrive. \n",
      "There are more than 130,000 Community First Responders today. From 2015 to January this year, they have responded to over 3,000 minor fire cases, 6,000 suspected cardiac arrest cases and saved more than 40 lives. \n",
      "To better equip these responders to respond to minor fires, SCDF will start a new trial to place one fire extinguisher at the ground floor of every two HDB blocks. When fully implemented over five years, this will benefit 1.1 million HDB households.\n",
      "Mr Murali also asked about the lessons we have learnt from our transformation journey. \n",
      "One key lesson is that transformation does not just come about by deploying more technology. We must also streamline our processes, train our officers with the relevant skills and make our partners a part of our transformation.\n",
      "Mr Chairman, the Home Team transforms its capabilities so that it can continue to respond effectively to a wide range of threats. \n",
      "Some, like terrorist attacks, we hope, never to have to respond to. But we must be prepared nonetheless and realistic exercises are one way we can achieve this. \n",
      "In March this year, the Home Team will be conducting Exercise Northstar XI, a major ground exercise which will test multiagency responses to a terrorist attack on Jurong Island. Exercise Northstar will bring together over 300 participants from agencies such as Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), Singapore Police Force (SPF), Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), JTC and private sector partners. This is a valuable opportunity to validate our interagency responses and capabilities in a realistic setting. \n",
      "Sir, on a completely different track, let me address Mr Pritam Singh's questions about the selection criteria for new citizens and whether we consider an applicant's extent of integration into Singapore society as the Swiss appear to. \n",
      "The short answer is \"yes\". We certainly consider the ability of an applicant to integrate in Singapore. But unlike the Swiss system, we do not use a naturalisation test or interviews. \n",
      "All tests have pitfalls. Sample questions for the Swiss naturalisation test can easily be found online. One can learn the right answers that immigration authorities want to hear and not actually be integrated with locals. \n",
      "Interviews, if conducted at scale, will also be resource-intensive and uneven in quality. Results are also not conclusive. For example, in 2021, 41% of those with a migrant background felt that they were not perceived as Swiss. This is a survey that was conducted by the Swiss themselves.\n",
      "Instead, we consider various markers of social integration such as family ties to Singaporeans, length of residency, whether the applicant studied in our national schools or completed National Service. These are assessed together with their economic contributions, qualifications and age.\n",
      "All applicants must also complete the Singapore Citizenship Journey before being granted citizenship. This programme helps participants better appreciate our history and culture. It was recently refreshed and enhanced, with content co-created with ordinary Singaporeans.   \n",
      "Sir, these measures are by no means perfect, but they have generally served us well. As to Mr Pritam Singh's call to publicise detailed criteria for assessing citizenship applications, let me restate the key reasons not to do so, which remain valid.\n",
      "First, detailed criteria can be abused to inflate an undeserving applicant's chances of success. There are applicants who submit false documents just to obtain immigration facilities. This problem will be exacerbated if we publish the detailed criteria and applicants know exactly what areas they can game. ICA will have a harder time securing the integrity of our process.  \n",
      "Second, we have unique sensitivities by virtue of history and geography. Today, most of our Permanent Residents (PR) and new Singapore Citizens (SC) come from neighbouring regions. This is unsurprising. We do not reveal our detailed criteria or disclose country-specific figures on our PR and SC population as this information could be misinterpreted or misused by others to stir up bilateral and domestic sensitivities.\n",
      "Mr Singh spoke about a points-based system and asked why MOM publicises its criteria for the assessment of Employment Passes (EP) whereas we do not for PR and SC. \n",
      "The considerations for EP are quite different. They are mainly to supplement our workforce. For most EPs, the stay in Singapore will come to an end. For PRs and SCs, this is far less likely. We must therefore also consider how they impact our demographic make-up and social fabric over the long term. Because of the permanent nature of PR and SC facilities, the need to guard against gaming is also greater. Mr Chairman, allow me now to speak in Mandarin. \n",
      "(In Mandarin): [Please refer to Vernacular Speech.] Mr Chairman, Singapore remains one of the safest countries in the world, in large part because the public has placed a high level of trust and confidence in the Home Team, and do their part to uphold law and order. \n",
      "But we cannot take our peaceful state of affairs for granted. The Home Team must anticipate and deal with emerging and evolving threats. We continue to put in place new laws and policies to improve Singapore's safety and security. \n",
      "One such area is our approach towards online harms. We have witnessed the online medium increasingly being used to facilitate crimes, such as large-scale scam operations and malicious cyber activities. \n",
      "Therefore, later this year, MHA will introduce the Online Criminal Harms Act. This will build on our existing laws and strengthen our ability to deal with online criminal activities. This includes powers to stop or remove online communications that facilitate crimes in the physical world, such as inciting violence.\n",
      "The Home Team will also continue to enhance our capabilities and partner the public to keep Singapore safe. \n",
      "For example, there are more than 130,000 Community First Responders (CFRs) today, who are members of the public who can provide immediate assistance to minor fire and cardiac arrest cases before our officers arrive. \n",
      "To better equip CFRs to respond to minor fires, SCDF will be embarking on a new trial to place one fire extinguisher at the ground floor of every two HDB blocks. When fully implemented over five years, this will benefit 1.1 million HDB households.\n",
      "Mr Chairman, Singapore's success in meeting safety and security threats relies on the collective effort of the Home Team and the public. The Home Team will continue to do our utmost to live up to the trust and confidence Singaporeans have placed in us, so that Singapore will remain a safe and secure home for all of us. \n",
      "(In English): Thank you, Sir.\n",
      "The Chairman: Minister of State Muhammad Faishal.\n",
      "The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim): Mr Chairman, the Home Team continues to do well in keeping our streets safe. However, terrorism poses a serious threat to our security. \n",
      "Mr Christopher de Souza asked about efforts to combat terrorism.\n",
      "International cooperation is critical to tackling terrorism and terrorism financing. We work closely with overseas counterparts to share intelligence on potential terror threats and conduct joint operations. We will continue to enhance collaboration through international platforms such as the Financial Action Task Force and INTERPOL.\n",
      "Within Singapore, we have implemented structures and processes to take swift action against terrorism financing. This includes the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism Steering Committee, which coordinates efforts amongst Government agencies.\n",
      "We also work closely with private sector partners under the Countering the Financing of Terrorism Operational Group. This workgroup facilitates round-the-clock investigative collaboration, allowing us to investigate terrorism financing expeditiously.\n",
      "Youth radicalisation cases have increased significantly in recent years. From 2002 to 2014, only two youths aged 20 were dealt with under the Internal Security Act (ISA) for terrorism-related activities. Since 2015, ISA orders were issued to 11 self-radicalised youths aged 20 and below.\n",
      "Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim asked about measures to address youth radicalisation. The Internal Security Department (ISD) has intensified its outreach. In 2022, ISD organised close to 70 counter-terrorism or radicalisation outreach events in schools and Institutes of Higher Learning targeting students and educators. This includes workshops to train school counsellors to identify signs of radicalisation and on early intervention. \n",
      "The upcoming Online Criminal Harms Act announced by the Second Minister earlier will also give us powers to direct takedowns of online content facilitating radicalisation. As the threat of terrorism in Singapore remains high, we will continue to enhance our operational capabilities and expand our outreach.\n",
      "4.30 pm\n",
      "I will now address cuts on drugs. Globally, drug use continues to rise, posing challenges to keeping Singapore drug-free. Locally, while the drug situation remains under control, we are concerned with drug abuse amongst youths. While most youths support a tough stance against drugs, some younger Singaporeans take a more permissive attitude, especially towards cannabis. \n",
      "Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked how we are preventing drug abuse. We will continue to strengthen our harm prevention approach to combat drug abuse. Our first line of defence against drugs is a well-informed public. Mr Christopher de Souza and Mr Derrick Goh asked about preventive drug education (PDE) for youths. \n",
      "The Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) will expand PDE efforts in schools. Secondary schools which did not do a PDE engagement in the last two years, will conduct at least one engagement in 2023. Moving forward, CNB is working with MOE to ensure all primary and secondary schools conduct at least one PDE programme annually. \n",
      "With TikTok becoming increasingly popular amongst youths, CNB launched its TikTok account last year, which regularly posts short videos of our drug enforcement efforts. Mr Christopher de Souza asked about sensitising the public to the threat of drug liberalisation globally. CNB highlights trends of concern in the global drug situation through various communication channels.\n",
      "As part of the #CNBPerspectives Series launched in 2022, CNB took to Facebook and Instagram to share worrying trends from the World Drug Report 2022. In fact, I also posted things relating to this to support their effort. These include the increase of cannabis-use disorders in jurisdictions which legalise cannabis for non-medical use. We also educate our anti-drug abuse advocates about the increasingly permissive views other countries have towards drugs and train them to speak up against drugs. \n",
      "The second pillar of our anti-drug strategy is tough laws and robust enforcement. To deter Singaporeans and PRs from abusing drugs overseas, CNB has stepped up enforcement at the checkpoints with the deployment of Saliva Test Kits from January this year. These kits, like the one I am holding here – they are light and compact. They offer a more efficient way to detect drug abusers at the checkpoints. \n",
      "This month, CNB and Police started trialling joint roadblock operations to detect drug abusers. Saliva Test Kits will also be used. Mr Derrick Goh asked about enforcement against New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) and vaping. The speed and breadth at which NPS variants have appeared have often outpaced authorities' ability to control them.\n",
      "On 24 February, MHA introduced a Bill to amend the Misuse of Drugs Act to control psychoactive substances based on their capacity to produce psychoactive effects rather than their chemical structure alone. This will empower CNB to take swift enforcement actions against illicit activities involving NPS. Enforcement against vaping will be addressed at the Ministry of Health (MOH)'s COS.   \n",
      "The third pillar of our anti-drug strategy is enhancing rehabilitation. Mr Raj Joshua Thomas asked about efforts to reduce drug recidivism. CNB recently reviewed its drug supervision regime and has deployed suitable officers to take on specialist roles in supervision to enhance the rehabilitation process. \n",
      "As I had announced last year, CNB has been piloting Community Supervision Sessions, in short, CoSS, since 2019, where supervision officers help supervisees address financial, housing and other rehabilitation needs.\n",
      "A supervisee who has benefited from CoSS is 46-year-old Mr Aidil. After his release from the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC) in 2021, Aidil was afraid of not being able to find a suitable job. Through CoSS sessions, Aidil was given career guidance and advice on his rehabilitation needs by his supervision officer. With this support, Aidil landed a part-time job within five months of his release. \n",
      "As the pilot has shown good results, I am pleased to announce that CoSS will be progressively rolled out to all supervisees by June this year. \n",
      "Mr Murali Pillai asked about support for desistors with drug-abusing pasts. The Singapore Prison Service (SPS) has enhanced its Psychology-based Correctional Programmes (PCPs) to be more targeted for repeated drug abusers during their in-care period. These PCPs will cater more time to address negative attitudes and improve emotional regulation, as both factors contribute to repeated drug use.\n",
      "Mr Murali Pillai, Mr Christopher de Souza, Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim and Mr Raj Joshua Thomas asked about efforts to reduce recidivism, and Mr Patrick Tay and Dr Tan Wu Meng asked about improving the employability of ex-offenders. \n",
      "Singapore's two-year recidivism rate is low and stable at around 20% for the 2020 release cohort. Our five-year rate is higher, at between 40% to 43%. Reducing long-term recidivism will not be easy. We must work with community partners to offer offenders and drug abusers an eco-system of support, starting from when they enter our prisons and DRCs and continuing after their release. Let me share our strategy to support them. \n",
      "First, by enhancing their skills and employment outcomes. Gainful employment allows ex-offenders to be financially independent and reduces risks of re-offending. In 2023, SPS and Yellow Ribbon Singapore (YRSG) will continue to work with partners to help ex-offenders upskill and boost their longer-term career progression. \n",
      "In collaboration with the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), SPS has set up education hubs to enrol more inmate students. In 2023, SPS will work with ITE to run more short courses, such as the Computer Maintenance course, following positive reviews.\n",
      "I am pleased to announce that YRSG is launching the YR Sandbox initiative to develop new career options in emerging sectors. YRSG will work with industry partners to hire releasing inmates and provide on-the-job training or work-study programmes. Potential sectors include skilled sectors like Digital, Built Environment and Agri-Tech.\n",
      "This new initiative complements TAP & Grow – TAP meaning \"Train and Place\". This scheme provides inmates with industry training in prison and potential job placement with a partner employer. TAP & Grow has been launched in the Precision Engineering, Media and Logistics and Wholesale sectors. As of 2022, a total of 422 inmates have completed the training programmes. \n",
      "In 2023, YRSG will expand TAP & Grow to Food Services, which we expect to benefit up to 700 inmates and ex-offenders annually. \n",
      "Mr Murali Pillai asked about the Uplifting Employment Credit (UEC). It will provide time-limited wage offsets to encourage employers to hire ex-offenders. More will be announced at MOM's COS. Currently, about two-thirds of ex-offenders secure employment within six months of release. We hope to improve this and will raise awareness of the UEC and other available support amongst employers.\n",
      "Dr Tan Wu Meng asked about recognition for inclusive employers. In 2022, over 200 employers, community partners, ex-offenders and volunteers were recognised for their contributions towards second chances through the Yellow Ribbon Awards. \n",
      " Sir, I would like to express my appreciation for NTUC in joining SPS and YRSG in engaging with inmates and ex-offenders to understand their concerns, priorities and aspirations through the #EveryWorkerMatters conversation.\n",
      "Second by strengthening pro-social support in the community. The community, including ex-offenders themselves and their family plays a critical role. Mr Christopher de Souza asked about enhancing post-release mentorship. \n",
      "I am pleased to announce that SPS has piloted a new scheme for volunteers to assist in the case management of selected supervisees emplaced on Community-Based Programmes (CBPs). Volunteer Case Officers will guide the supervisees towards a pro-social life during and beyond the CBP.\n",
      "SPS is working with community partners to launch the Desistor Network in April this year. Desistors who have stayed clear of crime and drugs will serve as mentors to recently released ex-offenders. This will also strengthen desistors' sense of self as contributing members of the community. \n",
      "Mr Raj Joshua Thomas asked about follow-ups from the CARE Network Summit 2022 and expanding YRSG's role. YRSG will continue to work closely with SPS and community partners via the CARE Network to tackle long-term recidivism. From 2023, the CARE Network will tap on the Desistor Network to co-opt desistors in planning and conducting programmes for ex-offenders.\n",
      "Family support is also critical. Mr Murali Pillai asked about supporting offenders to mend family ties. To aid in their family reintegration, SPS works with community partners to provide family programmes to inmates and befriending and other pro-social support to ex-offenders after release.\n",
      "Mr Christopher de Souza and Mr Raj Joshua Thomas asked about creating greater acceptance for ex-offenders and recruiting more volunteers to help with rehabilitation.  \n",
      "The Yellow Ribbon Project's (YRP) outreach has generated high awareness and support. Based on a 2022 survey, about 91% of respondents were aware of YRP's objectives, rehabilitation challenges faced by ex-offenders and the need to reduce stigma towards them. SPS and YRSG have expanded roles and training for volunteers in areas of in-care and aftercare, including support for families. Collectively, SPS and YRSG have more than 4,000 volunteers supporting rehabilitation.\n",
      "In 2023, YRSG will focus on showcasing inmates and ex-offenders' talents and contributions to reiterate that ex-offenders can contribute to society.\n",
      "Mr Murali Pillai asked about allowing desistors to perform at National Day Parades (NDPs). We have been providing desistors with opportunities to showcase their talent at public events. The Yellow Ribbon Performing Arts Centre Alumni Band had performed at Red Dot August at the Esplanade for the past three years. We will explore more opportunities. \n",
      "Mr Raj Joshua Thomas asked about alleviating the impact of incarceration on one's family. Yellow Ribbon Community Project (YRCP) grassroots volunteers have engaged over 19,000 families since 2010, linking them to community assistance and ensuring their well-being. In 2023, we will strengthen support for inmates' families by collaborating with more community resources, such as religious organisations, Social Service Offices (SSOs) and Family Service Centres (FSCs).\n",
      "Mr Patrick Tay asked for a review of the Registration of Criminals Act on spent offences. From time to time, MHA reviews the spent regime for criminal records. In our last review in 2021, we assessed that the existing regime continues to be appropriate to facilitate the reintegration of ex-offenders, in particular those who committed minor crimes. This position took into consideration the many initiatives to facilitate reintegration and reduce long-term recidivism. \n",
      "Mr Patrick Tay asked about support for female ex-offenders. In September 2022, SPS set up a secular all-women halfway house, named Rise Above Halfway House (RAHWH). RAHWH provides gender-responsive interventions and facilitates social reintegration for the residents. As of February 2023, 31 female offenders have been emplaced to RAHWH. We will continue to support female ex-offenders and facilitate their reintegration.\n",
      "4.45 pm\n",
      "Next, Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim asked about collaboration with the Malay-Muslim community to better support inmates and ex-offenders. I will now speak in Malay about our community's crucial role. \n",
      "(In Malay): [Please refer to Vernacular Speech.] Sir, many Malay-Muslim Organisations (MMOs) have stepped forward to work with SPS and CNB to prevent offending and re-offending by providing support to inmates, ex-offenders, and their family from incarceration to post-release. These include AMP, FITRAH, Jamiyah, PERGAS, PPIS, PERTAPIS, Yayasan Mendaki and a number of mosques.\n",
      "Let me share some examples of how these MMOs have stepped forward to offer assistance.\n",
      "FITRAH has developed a values-centric in-care religious programme for inmates and prepares Friday Prayer sermons that are contextualised to their rehabilitation needs.\n",
      "FITRAH has galvanised all 71 mosques to support inmates, ex-offenders and their family, beyond zakat assistance. Today, all mosques are familiar with FITRAH's work and refer them to FITRAH for support, such as befriending.\n",
      "Many MMOs have joined Singapore's efforts in supporting rehabilitation. MHA recognises that there is value in coordinating all these efforts to create greater synergy. In November 2021, we launched the MMO Rehabilitation Network, which brings together 26 MMOs and all eleven M³@Towns.\n",
      "Since its launch, many collaborations have been forged. For example, FITRAH has collaborated with New Life Stories to develop a referral system where they can tap on each other's expertise. Jamiyah Halfway House has collaborated with the West Mosque Cluster to further support the reintegration of its residents.\n",
      "Supporting inmates, ex-offenders and their family is an endeavour that cannot be undertaken by the Home Team alone. I am thankful to MMOs for working closely with us to uplift and make a difference to the lives of our beneficiaries.\n",
      "Your efforts and contributions have helped to keep the recidivism rates low and the number of new drug abusers stable. Keep up the good work!\n",
      "(In English): Sir, in conclusion, thanks to our Home Team Officers, Singapore remains safe and secure. We will continue to work with our community partners to combat terrorism, prevent drug abuse and support our inmates and ex-offenders.\n",
      "The Chairman: Minister of State Sun Xueling.\n",
      "The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling): Mr Chairman, we have a war against scams on our hands. In 2022, we saw 31,728 scam cases, a 32.6% increase from 2021. More than $660 million was lost, 4.5% higher than 2021. \n",
      "Mr Sitoh Yin Pin asked for an update on the Government's efforts to combat scams. I chair the Inter-Ministry Committee on Scams, which leads a multi-agency effort to develop a systems wide collective shield to protect us from scams. We deploy a multi-layered defence strategy against scams: first, we endeavour to block scam calls, SMSes, online listings and websites; second, we secure Government services and banking channels; third, we strengthen our enforcement capabilities; and lastly, we strengthen our laws.\n",
      "Mr Christopher de Souza and Mr Vikram Nair asked how the Government partners industry and people sector stakeholders to combat scams. Mr Christopher de Souza asked about the use of technology in our efforts to fight scams. \n",
      "The Home Team has established partnerships across Government, private and people sectors, using technology to aid our efforts.\n",
      "For calls, SPF works closely with local telecommunication companies to terminate mobile lines used for scams. In 2022, more than 6,500 such mobile lines were terminated. The SPF also engaged WhatsApp on more than 22,800 WhatsApp lines believed to be used in scams in 2022.\n",
      "For SMSes, IMDA mandated SMS Sender ID registration from January 2023 and implemented anti-scam filters to detect potential scam SMSes. Under the Sender ID regime, all non-registered senders are flagged as \"Likely-SCAM\". After a transition period, SMSes carrying unregistered Sender IDs will be blocked upfront. \n",
      "To address scams arising from international numbers, the IMDA is exploring offering the option to members of the public to not to receive international calls and SMSes. More details will be released when ready.\n",
      "For online listings, the SPF partners social media companies and e-marketplaces to remove suspicious accounts and advertisements. In 2022, more than 3,100 accounts and advertisements suspected of involvement in scams were removed. \n",
      "For websites, SPF uses analytic tools to identify and block scam websites, by detecting tell-tale characteristics. In 2022, about 20,000 scam websites were blocked. \n",
      "The Home Team also works with stakeholders to secure Government services and banking channels, so scammers cannot exploit system vulnerabilities.\n",
      "We have onboarded all Government agencies onto the SMS Sender ID registry, making Government agencies harder to spoof. We are considering measures that allow the verification of incoming calls from Government officials.\n",
      "The SPF also deepened their partnership with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and domestic banks to flag and freeze suspicious accounts. Over the past year, MAS worked with the Association of Banks in Singapore, or ABS in short, on the following measures: (a) a cooling-off period for provisioning new digital tokens; (b) removing clickable links from official emails and SMSes; (c) lowering default transaction limits; and (d) an emergency self-service \"kill switch\", allowing customers to suspend their accounts quickly if compromised. \n",
      "The MAS and the ABS are exploring a \"Money Lock\" solution, which enables customers to \"lock up\" a designated sum in their bank accounts. This reduces the amount that could potentially be lost to scams via digital transfers. \n",
      "Mr Derrick Goh spoke about the increased use of foreign payment gateways. As more foreign gateways open up, we are also working with MAS to review and enhance the suite of anti-scam measures to mitigate the risk of these channels being used for illicit purposes.\n",
      "Mr Chairman, no defence is impenetrable. Some scams will succeed. For example, investment scams and job scams, which contributed to the bulk of monies lost to scams in Singapore, are very hard to tackle. We have thus strengthened our enforcement capabilities, to minimise the number of victims and amounts lost to scammers.\n",
      "[Deputy Speaker (Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo) in the Chair]\n",
      "The Anti-Scam Command was formed last year to consolidate expertise in combatting scams across the SPF. In 2022, 25 island-wide anti-scam enforcement operations led to over 8,000 money mules and scammers being investigated.\n",
      "Mr Vikram Nair asked about our collaborations with foreign law enforcement authorities to address the transnational nature of scams. The SPF works closely with their foreign counterparts to exchange information and conduct joint operations. In 2022, this led to the successful take-down of 13 syndicates. The SPF arrested more than 70 people based overseas, who were responsible for more than 280 scam cases.\n",
      "Mr Christopher de Souza also asked about MHA's plans to reduce the prevalence of money mules. We intend to tighten the law against those who facilitate the movement of scam proceeds.\n",
      "Currently, the vast majority of money mule investigations do not result in prosecution. Based on current laws, we need to prove that the money mule knew that the monies he was handling were linked to criminal activity. We will amend the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act, or CDSA, to prescribe specific conduct for which we can hold mules criminally liable. \n",
      "MHA is also working with SNDGO on legislative amendments to the Penal Code to curb abuse of SingPass credentials as a vector to perpetrate scams. \n",
      "Given the evolving landscape of scams, new forms of scams will emerge. Mr Christopher de Souza asked about the processes in place to inform and activate stakeholders to address the latest scams. \n",
      "Once we are aware of an emergent scam, the SPF works with the media and other stakeholders to publicise information on it so that the public can be put on guard. The SPF also taps on its partnerships with sectoral stakeholders to swiftly activate a multi-layered defence, which we adapt as the scam evolves. \n",
      "The best defence against scams is a vigilant and discerning public. To defend ourselves and our loved ones, we need to move beyond awareness, to mobilise every citizen to take action against scams. \n",
      "Mr Christopher de Souza asked how the Government is keeping up our public education efforts to prevent scams. In January this year, we launched a new national anti-scam campaign with the tagline \"I can ACT against scams\" as our rallying call.\n",
      "ACT is an acronym for three key actions that each of us can take to keep ourselves safe from scams. \"A\" stands for Adding security features such as installing the ScamShield app on mobile devices. \"C\" stands for Checking for scam signs and verifying with official sources. \"T\" stands for Telling authorities, family and friends about scams.\n",
      "We will be launching the Scam Public Education Office later this year to drive our collective efforts with community partners and expand our outreach on scams, including (a) collaborating with NCPC to create and curate anti-scam public education content at the national level; and (b) working with private sector and community agencies to tailor our anti-scam public education efforts for different population segments.  \n",
      "In September 2022, we expanded the ScamShield app to Android device users. ScamShield protects users by blocking calls from known scam numbers and filtering out potential scam SMSes. It also allows users to report scam calls and scam SMSes. We are working closely with GovTech to roll out ScamShield 2.0, which will include a WhatsApp chatbot for the public to report scam messages. \n",
      "I encourage all citizens to download and use the ScamShield app. By playing your part in reporting scam calls, SMSes, and WhatsApp messages, you protect others by enabling the Police to detect scam messages and fraudulent WhatsApp accounts much more quickly and to put these scam messages on a blacklist. \n",
      "Mr Derrick Goh spoke about potential levers to ensure co-operation and accountability with stakeholders. Last year, we launched the E-commerce Marketplace Transaction Safety Ratings (TSR), a consumer advisory that reviews and tracks the transaction safety of major e-commerce marketplaces based on specific metrics. The TSR encourages marketplaces to deter and detect scams committed on their platforms. It allows consumers to make informed decisions on where to do their online shopping safely. We will be refreshing the platform ratings in the TSR in April. \n",
      "Mr Murali Pillai referred to his previous suggestion for SPF to publish the amounts seized and returned to victims. The SPF does not actively track the cumulative dollar value of assets recovered and the amount returned to victims. The seizure of $172.8 million in assets that Mr Pillai referred to, was a statistic quoted from INTERPOL's article, about a global INTERPOL operation that Singapore participated in.\n",
      "5.00 pm\n",
      "Beyond being aware and acting against scams, we need to educate the public on the consequences of engaging in scam activities. Mr Derrick Goh asked about our efforts and partnerships to address the increase in youths involved with scams and to encourage positive youth development. \n",
      "A key initiative for youths is the biannual Delta League, run by SPF and NCPC. Youth participants engage in sports and participate in crime prevention activities, which enhance their awareness of the consequences of crime. More than 1,200 youths participated in the most recent Delta League which engaged participants in activities that educated them on scams.\n",
      "SPF also issues mid-year and year-end advisories to students and parents through schools to remind students to steer clear of crime, including being alert against attempts to trick them into becoming money mules. The SPF will continue to work with its stakeholders to promote a sense of social responsibility among our youths.\n",
      "Dr Shahira Abdullah suggested having a one-stop unit to assist scam victims and address their financial and emotional needs.\n",
      "The Victim Care Cadre programme under the SPF provides support to crime victims. Where needed, the Police activate volunteer Victim Care Officers, or VCOs, who work with the Police Psychological Services Department to provide psychological first aid. Where necessary, the VCOs will also direct victims to available community and professional resources for longer-term psychological support and/or financial support. This includes Family Service Centres, Samaritans of Singapore and the hospitals. \n",
      "Dr Shahira Abdullah spoke about disabled scam victims, and deaf persons in particular, getting timely help. Crime victims have multiple avenues for reporting, including online. If a report is lodged in person, the Police buildings are designed to be accessible for persons with disabilities. And if needed, sign language interpreters will be engaged to assist.  \n",
      "I will now address a question on the working hours of security officers. Mr Raj Joshua Thomas asked if the Government would take the lead to regularise their hours, by requiring shorter shift hours for all Government security contracts. \n",
      "Since 2020, it has been mandatory for public agencies to adopt outcome-based contracts for procuring security services. New tenders are generally required to specify outcomes, rather than dictate a fixed headcount or shift hours. This allows security agencies to optimise security solutions that integrate manpower, technology and processes, giving them the flexibility to decide on the duration of each security officer's shift. The Government will continue working with tripartite partners to further improve the working conditions of security officers.\n",
      "Mr Chairman, kindly allow me to say a few words in Mandarin.\n",
      "(In Mandarin): [Please refer to Vernacular Speech.] We are fighting a war against scams. Scammers are vicious and cunning. They prey on our natural human needs and motivation such as desire for companionship or additional income to support our families.\n",
      "Scammers often exploit our individual characteristics. For example, compliant residents may be targeted by scammers impersonating Government agents. The scammers may also target those who are impulsive in nature and create an artificial sense of urgency and require the victims to transfer money and provide information promptly.\n",
      "Scammed victims are often hurt more than just financially. They also suffer emotionally as well as mentally. In cases of love scams or fake friend calls, scammers normally take time to cultivate a close relationship with the victim, gaining their trust before draining their bank accounts. These victims not only suffer financial losses, but also often feel guilty or betrayed. They are hurt deeply emotionally and may even have difficulties to trust others in future.\n",
      "As with modern military weapons, the design of scams takes the form of innovative disguises meant to target our needs and desires. The traps they set up are everywhere and every day we find ourselves barraged by various scams. \n",
      "I would like to emphasize here that everyone could encounter scammers, and everyone can be scammed. We must remain vigilant and never let our guard down.  \n",
      "(In English): Mr Chairman, everyone has a part to play to keep Singapore safe and secure. While the Government will step up measures to protect us against scams, we need to remain alert and ready to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe. Beyond exercising individual responsibility, let us also look out for and support others in our community, to strengthen our collective resilience. Together, we will be able to fight the war against scams.\n",
      "The Chairman: Leader of the Opposition.\n",
      "Mr Pritam Singh: Thank you, Mdm Chair. Just some clarification questions for Minister pertaining to my cut on new citizen selection which would come under the ambit of the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority.\n",
      "The first clarification I have is the point about sensitivities. I think Minister shared that countries-specific information is not put out because it can be misinterpreted, I believe that is what the Minister said. I stand corrected if that is incorrect.\n",
      "My point is, based on the latest Census, and the Census before that, in 10-year intervals, information on the place of birth of PRs and citizens is actually provided in 10-yearly intervals. So, the countries that are covered – Malaysia, China, India, Indonesia, Europe, USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and other Asian countries – this information that is already provided. So, what specific sensitivities is the Minister referring to when the Minister says that revealing countries-specific information could be misinterpreted?\n",
      "The second question has to do with my point in the cut, I do not believe Minister addressed it. It has to do with English as a criterion for citizenship selection because of its utility as a language of better integration between Singaporeans and new citizens. Can the Minister confirm whether this is part of the process in assessing individuals for citizenship?\n",
      "My third clarification is on the refreshed Singapore Citizenship journey that Minister spoke of. Very recently, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs in Singapore, Mr George Yeo, spoke of suggestion of new citizens being approved by a jury of ordinary Singaporeans and these are his comments:\n",
      "\"We are completely self-interested. So, we bring in clever people, wealthy people, connected people. But some of them when they come in, they think they are a blessing to Singaporeans and act as if we should be pleased that they are here. I met some of them when I was a Member of Parliament. They talk as if we owe them. Now, this psychology is very important that Singaporeans do not feel that the foreigners whom we bring in are lording over them and looking down on them and misbehaving.\"\n",
      "In this regard, Minister said that the content of the refreshed —\n",
      "The Chairman: Mr Singh, could you get to your question?\n",
      "Mr Pritam Singh: Yes, I am putting my question across now, Mdm Chair. And in this context, with regard to the refreshed Singapore Citizenship journey, Minister shared that the content was co-created with Singaporeans. Can I just confirm with the Minister, which aspect of the content is she referring to? Thank you, Mdm Chair.\n",
      "Mrs Josephine Teo: Mdm Chair, I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his questions. He asked what aspects of our immigration information is not broken down by specific countries. And I believe if you look at the reports to do with annual awards of Permanent Residency and Singapore Citizenship, we speak of the regions from which the new citizens as well as the new permanent residents originate from.\n",
      "On the second question that he asked for a clarification on, Mdm Chair, if I may ask the Leader of the Opposition is he advocating that a test of English should be applied before someone can be considered for Permanent Residency and citizenship? Is he advocating a position or he is merely asking a question?\n",
      "Mdm Deputy Speaker: Mr Singh.\n",
      "Mr Pritam Singh: Mdm Chair, I thank the Minister for that. I believe it would be helpful, so I would advocate for it. And I used the peg of the findings of the latest Census report which spoke of English and how commonly it is spoken in Singapore, comparing 2020 to 2010 and it is much more widely spoken today. So, the peg that I am coming in from is its utility as a tool to improve integration between Singaporeans and new citizens.\n",
      "So, in that regard, given the new information that we have, I believe it could be a helpful tool to improve integration.\n",
      "Just on the first clarification that Minister provided, I do not think Minister answered the question. I am suggesting that those countries, the information which shows where someone was born is actually already provided in 10-year Census. So, what sensitivities apply with regard to not wanting to release that information on a yearly basis when I see it releases its information on PRs and citizenships awarded that year?\n",
      "Mrs Josephine Teo: I think we have said this on previous occasions. I think you can imagine the scenario if you publish this information on such a current basis, how this information can be misinterpreted and also can be used to suggest that we are friendly or not as friendly to certain nationalities, and even to certain ethnicities. I do not have anything new to add to the previous explanations that had been provided.\n",
      "On Mr Singh's advocacy of us using English perhaps as a test of the ability of a new citizen or permanent resident to integrate, I must admit to being quite surprised by his position, the reason being that firstly, one can imagine that for most applicants to permanent residency and citizenship if they have been in Singapore for a number of years, particularly if they had worked here, a facility with English is not surprising. And I would think a test need not be applied.\n",
      "For those who perhaps do not have the facility with English, cannot communicate easily in English, I think from our ground interactions, it is also quite clear who these individuals are likely to be. They are likely to be spouses of citizens or other permanent residents and have come from the same country of origin and unless we are saying that we, therefore, do not welcome such foreign spouses, then I am not sure to what extent a test of English that could be applied to prevent them from being considered would be helpful.\n",
      "Thirdly, on the ground, every day we meet with residents who cannot speak a word of English. I do not think anyone would suggest that they are any less integrated to Singapore society. As to some of the comments he made about applicants who may lord it over Singaporeans and so on, I am not sure what the question is, perhaps I could ask him to repeat it.\n",
      "The Chairman: Mr Singh, please keep it succinct so that others will have a chance to also ask their clarifications.\n",
      "5.15 pm\n",
      "Mr Pritam Singh: Yes, Mdm Chair. The question was with regard to the point that Minister made in her speech about the refreshed Singapore Citizenship Journey. And she mentioned that the content was co-created with citizens. So, I have asked what aspect of the content was co-created by citizens.\n",
      "Mrs Josephine Teo: I do not have the details of those content. But if the Leader of the Opposition is interested, we could share it with them. The Singapore Citizenship Journey includes materials that are shared with the applicants to our citizenship. And they can look at these materials in order to be more familiar with Singapore history and culture. Those probably have involved other citizens in terms of their development. And there is also, if I recall correctly, a component of the Singapore Citizenship Journey that takes these applicants to various locations. Those are materials that we can provide to you. \n",
      "The Chairman: Mr Christopher de Souza.\n",
      "Mr Christopher de Souza: Thank you, Chair, I have three clarifications. One on scams, one on cannabis and one on technology.\n",
      "My experience on the ground is, in terms of scams, it happens very, very quickly. Within a span of three weeks, I had two separate families come and see me. One had lost $280,000 and one having lost $80,000. And what they shared with me is that, through many money mule accounts in Singapore, money is transferred from account to account, and then transferred out. And while they are interested in prosecution of those involved in this, they are most concerned with the recovery of the money.\n",
      "That is the sentiment on the ground. My humble suggestion and respectful suggestion is that, we build in a \"kill switch\" that would just stop the flow of money from one account to the next account prior to it leaving our shores. So, would that be considered or enhanced?\n",
      "The second point is about cannabis. I listened very carefully to the Minister of State Faishal's response and I thank him for that. Would it be useful to share with the public the long-term societal harm of recreational cannabis use? And I use Washington state is a good starting point. I am not saying it has worked well or negatively there, but it is the 10th year anniversary of Washington state legalising recreational use of marijuana. I think it did so in December 2012.\n",
      "So, if we can have some statistical, empirical evidential data on what the societal effect, the effect on society are – employability, mental health, family relationships, long term – then, we will be on firmer standing on our zero-tolerance to drugs.\n",
      "The Chairman: Mr de Souza, can you ask your clarifications?\n",
      "Mr Christopher de Souza: Yes, Madam. Third point is technology. I thank Minister Mrs Josephine Teo for her explanation on how we are using drones and unmanned surveillance equipment. My humble suggestion is that that not substitute the need for good human ground judgement in order to know how to prevent crime and also disperse crowds. I am speaking up very much in favour of the retention of best-in-class, world-class officers on the ground to do their job, and not an over-reliance on technology. Thank you, Chair, for your Indulgence.\n",
      "The Chairman: Minister of State Sun.\n",
      "Ms Sun Xueling: I thank the Member Mr Christopher de Souza on his first question regarding scams. Indeed, we have a \"kill switch\" which I mentioned in my main reply. This emergency self-service \"kill switch\" allows customers to suspend their accounts quickly, if compromised. But this is their own account. As noted by Mr Christopher de Souza, what happens often is that the original sum of monies from the bank account, customer's account, gets dismantled, dispersed and then, goes through the banking system into various other bank accounts not owned by them. So, while the bank account, the original bank account holder, the victim has activated the \"kill switch\" for his or her own account, it has not stopped the monies from being transferred to other accounts.\n",
      "And that is why what we intend to do with the money mules is an important step because we want to prevent these money mules from setting up or using multiple bank accounts to allow the scam proceeds to filter through the system. We have also co-located the seven major retail banks together at Anti-Scam Command so that they can coordinate their efforts.\n",
      "I would like to give an example of one case I looked at. There was one victim. And guess how many accounts the original sum of monies went through? Eighty-nine bank accounts. That was how quickly bank accounts were set up and the monies is dispersed through the banking system. And that is why it is important that we work with the various retail banks to have the retail banks co-located together so that we can share information quickly and for the banks to quickly trace the monies and close off those bank accounts and stop the monies from moving through the banking system and then, out of Singapore, whereby it is then out of our jurisdiction.\n",
      "The Chairman: Minister of State Faishal.\n",
      "Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim: Madam, I thank Member Mr Christopher de Souza for the suggestion. Indeed, we have been studying the effects and we also have been sharing some of these through our various platforms, including our #CNB Perspective Series. And essentially, if you look, for example, in the US, for those jurisdiction where cannabis is legalised, you see that the prevalence of cannabis consumption is significantly higher in these states, compared to the overall average. So, that is one.\n",
      " Another part is, we can also see the more adverse effects, in terms of the medical and health perspective, and also the number of emergency visits and treatments that have been required.\n",
      "For example, in California, after the opening of the retail sales market for cannabis, emergency visits and admissions related to any cannabis use increased by 56% from 2016 to 2019. These are things that we continue to follow because we are convinced of the harmful effects of drugs, including cannabis, and we want to share a lot more of these with our people.\n",
      "In fact, in the coming months, I am going to share, through my social media platforms, some of the perspectives that we know, that we have learnt from our counterparts overseas, who may have a different stance on drugs. We will do that. And I thank the Member for believing in this; and we really, really appreciate your support.\n",
      "The Chairman: Minister Josephine Teo.\n",
      "Mrs Josephine Teo: Mdm Chair, I thank Mr Christopher de Souza for reaffirming the importance of our officers and their skills level, even as we deploy more technology in carrying out our mission. Let me assure him that the points that he made are definitely not lost on us. Ultimately, we will still need officers who have the judgement. We need officers who understand our cultural context and our operating conditions in order that they will be able to put the technologies to good use.\n",
      "Even in the way we develop the technologies, we need human talent. I mentioned in my speech earlier that HTX intends to fill something like 500 positions this year alone. And if you compare it to the size of HTX today, which is about 1,500, that is still a 25% increase simply to build the capabilities to use technology more effectively.\n",
      "So, it is a question of where we are deploying our talent resources in the sense of using technology as a force multiplier. That is still the approach that we hope to take in order to serve Singaporeans better, in order to protect Singaporeans through use of technology in the appropriate way and also to do so in such a manner as not to overly strain our resources.\n",
      "The Chairman: Mr Gan Thiam Poh.\n",
      "Mr Gan Thiam Poh: Mdm Chair, I just overheard about the saliva test kit. Can Minister of State share more about it. I find it quite interesting. It is very welcome.\n",
      "Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim: I have tried it. [Laughter.] Essentially, if you look at it, drugs in the body can enter oral fluid, the saliva, through passive diffusion from blood or may be deposited in the oral cavity during oral, smoke or intranasal administration. So, indeed, drug metabolites also can be detected in saliva. That is one.\n",
      "Then, the saliva test, I have shown you earlier: you need to swab a person's tongue, using the test kit to obtain minute sample of saliva. So, the test kit subsequently will check the saliva for controlled drugs and produces results in about eight to 10 minutes. So, it is quite fast. It is similar to the COVID-19 test kits where the test kit will produce red lines if particular drugs are present. So, it is quick, efficient, fast.\n",
      "Nevertheless, we will also have a double check. That means, if we find that there are some test results which are positive, we will bring them back to do further testing.\n",
      "The Chairman: Mr Raj Joshua Thomas.\n",
      "Mr Raj Joshua Thomas: Thank you, Mdm Chair. I thank the Minister of State for her response on my question of regularising security officers' working hours. And I understand her response is that the Government has implemented security outcome-based contracts (OBCs) for all of their security contracts.\n",
      "My clarification is whether, in precisely these security OBCs, whether the Government can implement higher weightage for bid proposals that propose shorter working hours? For security officers for two reasons: first, it has been shown that when security officers work shorter hours, they are operationally more effective, which is an outcome in and of itself; and the second is to support the overall effort to better the working conditions of our outsourced workers.\n",
      "Ms Sun Xueling: I thank the Member for his question. We share the same sentiment. We want to improve the working hours, the working conditions for our security officers.\n",
      "So, what we are trying to do now is that we want to work with stakeholders to look at outcome-based driven approaches and we do know that actually, the industry needs time to also develop expertise, because we are talking about a better match between manpower with technology and also with the solutions that are available.\n",
      "We will take into account the suggestion that the Member has made. We will go back and look into it and see how the Government agencies can further drive initiatives on this front.\n",
      "The Chairman: Mr Christopher de Souza.\n",
      "Mr Christopher de Souza: Thank you, Madam. I thank Minister of State Sun for the response and thank you for clarifying that there is a \"kill switch\" option on the part of the consumer. May I humbly propose that the \"kill switch\" option or power, also be bestowed on the banks? Because, in the example that Minister of State Sun provided, which is actually consistent with the example that was given to me by the residents who spoke with me, was that: from one account, it goes to six accounts, it goes to 36 accounts and carries on.\n",
      "5.30 pm\n",
      "So, if that algorithm or pattern is recognised by the bank internally, then my humble question is, ought not the bank then be given the power to \"kill switch\" the transmission of monies from accounts to accounts, without the incumbency being on the consumer, on the customer, but the bank itself. Could that be considered? \n",
      "Ms Sun Xueling: I thank the Member for his supplementary question. As I mentioned, the seven major retail banks are co-located with each other and the sole purpose is to be able to exchange information quickly, once they are aware that a scam has occurred, that the victim has lost money. The seven major retail banks are working closely together, together with the SPF, to provide standby services 24/7 and they aim to freeze accounts within an hour. So, we definitely try to do so.\n",
      "But the reason I actually use the example was to demonstrate the complexity. Because of the proliferation of the number of bank accounts that are being created by money mules who are negligent in the way they have given up control of their bank accounts or some have given up their Singpass IDs to allow others to set up bank accounts, many of these bank accounts are being used to launder these proceeds. And the banks do need time to be able to trace the monies and activate the \"kill switch\", as you say so.\n",
      "This is something that the banks are working on. The banks are working closely with the SPF to do that within an hour, to freeze the accounts so that there is a higher chance that we can prevent the monies from going out of the system, that we can return those monies to the victims.\n",
      "The Chairman: Mr Vikram Nair. \n",
      "Mr Vikram Nair: I just want to pick up on the point on international scams. I do not know whether it is Minister or the Senior Minister of State, but the number of scams that are routed internationally, what percentage would that be and how effective are we in capturing these and recovering proceeds? I think you mentioned a number of about 70 people have been arrested, but what percentage is that of the bigger pool?\n",
      "Ms Sun Xueling: Based on the numbers I have, more than 90% of scam cases that we know of originated from overseas. Like I have mentioned in my main reply, we work closely with foreign law enforcement agencies, but there are many operational challenges.\n",
      "Not all foreign law enforcement agencies conduct their operations the way we do. They may face very specific challenges in their home countries, cities or villages. And that is something that we do not have control over. But where we can, it is definitely our desire to work with the foreign law enforcement agencies and after they find out who the perpetrators are, they conduct those raids, they inform us. Sometimes, they are able to recover some portion of the scam proceeds. Because you can imagine that the scam proceeds actually move very quickly in the system, even if you were to trace them to Country A which was where the scam proceeds first go to, you never know how those scam proceeds then find its way to other countries or to other parts of the banking system. Or they may even have been changed into non-cash proceeds, for instance.\n",
      "So, I would just like to share with the Member that definitely we work with foreign law enforcement agencies, but we have to be mindful that there are operational challenges and that even when they are able to recover some portion of the scam proceeds, there are actually many, many claimants to those scam proceeds. And so, there is some difficulty to be able to return those monies in its totality to the victim.\n",
      "The Chairman: Mr Murali, would you like to withdraw your amendment? \n",
      "Mr Murali Pillai: Mdm Chairperson, with your indulgence, I would like to thank the hon members who filed 27 cuts spanning 52.5 minutes on various topics that made this debate quite enriching. But I also would like to extend my appreciation to hon Second Minister and the two hon Ministers of State for their responses and outlining their strategies to keep Singapore safe and secure. And I am sure the hon Members who join me in wishing them well in their respective missions. With that, Mdm Chairman, may I seek leave to withdraw the cut?\n",

       "['Order read for the Resumption of Debate on Question [17 April 2023].\\n\"That the following Address in reply to the Speech of the President be agreed to:\\n\\'We, the Parliament of the Republic of Singapore, express our thanks to the President for the Speech which she delivered on behalf of the Government at the Opening of the Second Session of this Parliament.\\'.\" – [Mr Murali Pillai]\\nQuestion again proposed.\\nMr Speaker: Mr Murali Pillai.\\n12.33 pm\\nMr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok): Mr Speaker, Sir, I seek a clarification of a response given by the hon Member Mr Leon Perera to Minister Ong Ye Kung yesterday. \\nAs may be recalled, the hon Member Mr Perera mentioned, in relation to the GST, that the Workers\\' Party (WP) accepted the GST at 7% and conveyed this in 2018. My interest is that I actually spoke about the WP position from 1993 when the GST Bill was being introduced all the way to date, and I checked the Hansard. \\nSo, I would like to seek clarification from the hon Member as to when and where this position of the WP was articulated.\\nMr Speaker: Mr Perera.\\nMr Leon Perera (Aljunied): I thank the hon Member Mr Murali Pillai for that question. What I had said and I will repeat that here, is that if you go back to those debates in Parliament in 2018, we opposed a hike of GST from 7% to 9%. At no point in that debate did we call for the GST to be lowered from 7% to 0%.\\n Mr Pillai makes reference to positions that were articulated by the WP in the 1990s. I do not know whether it is fair to bring up positions that were taken in the 1990s and have a debate about that. By the same token, I could bring up positions that the People\\'s Action Party (PAP) has taken in the 1990s and table that for discussion here, such as the Graduate Mother\\'s Policy, such as votes for upgrading, for example.\\n So, I think the point here is that at no point since the idea of a GST hike from 7% to 9% was first mooted and put on the table here in Parliament, which is in 2018 as I recall, at no point did anyone in the WP call for the GST to be lowered from 7% to 0%. And if there is anyone or if there is any evidence or reference that the Member can make, for anyone in the WP making that specific call, then we would be glad to discuss that. \\nMr Speaker: Mr Pillai. \\nMr Murali Pillai: I thank the hon Member Mr Perera for clarifying that the acceptance of the stance of GST being at 7% is to be implied from the fact that in 2018, when it was proposed by the Government to increase the GST from 7% to 9%, the WP did not ask for a reduction of the percentage. \\nJust on a point of elucidation, GST was not being increased for the first time in 2018. It was actually being increased progressively from 3% to 4% to 5%. And, in around 2007, it was increased from 5% to 7%. So, I take it that as far as my learned friend, or rather, the hon Member Mr Perera is concerned, this implicit decision to accept GST was made in 2018 when the Government conveyed its decision to propose an increase of GST from 7% to 9%. And if that is the case, then I think we have a happy situation because the gulf, or the gap, between the WP and the PAP is now narrowed from 9% to now 2%.\\nMr Speaker: Mr Perera.\\nMr Leon Perera: I thank the hon Member for his statements and, just to reiterate, when this idea of GST was mooted, we did not call for any reduction of the GST rate from 7% to 0%. So, that is, indeed, the position, and that would be borne out if you go back to those debates from 2018 until now.\\n I would again remind the Member with respect that if we are to bring up policy positions that have been taken decades ago and table them for debate, then I think the policies of the PAP from decades ago should also be put here and tabled for debate as well. \\nBut I do not think that that would be constructive because everyone evolves their position as conditions evolve. And I think for us in the WP, and it may be the same for the PAP, whenever we have to make a decision on whether to take a position on a policy, you look at all the options that are there on the table and you decide what is in the best interest of the country, what is rational, what is fact-based, and you take a position at that point in time on that particular issue. But I thank the Member for his comments.\\nMr Speaker: Mr Pillai.  \\nMr Murali Pillai: I thank again Mr Perera for his answers. And maybe, Your Honour, if I could clarify, my interest in relation to raising the position of the WP from the 1990s is, with respect, not unfair because what we need is clarity on where the WP – and, for that reason, any party – stands on important issues. \\nSo, if it, indeed, had evolved, then it will be incumbent on any party to then make that position very clear, so that the public understands where the parties are on these important issues.\\nMr Speaker: I am honoured, Mr Murali. But this is not a Court. Mr Dennis Tan.\\n12.38 pm\\nMr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang): Mr Speaker, I support the Motion of Thanks to the President for her address during the Opening of the second session of the 14th Parliament.\\nMr Speaker, we read in the news this week that the Certificate of Entitlement (COE) premium for smaller cars crossed the $100,000 mark to reach a record high of $103,721. New records were also set in the larger car and open categories at $120,889 and $124,501 respectively. And I read that the latter is the highest price ever posted for any category of COEs.\\nThe President of the Singapore Vehicle Traders Association, Mr Neo Tiam Ting, told The Straits Times that the companies that are supplying cars for ride hailing services are a key driver behind the demand for COEs in recent years. He said that these companies which grow their fleets aggressively and pushed up COE premiums in the process are able to pass on the higher cost in the form of relatively small increases in daily rental rates while private buyers have to stomach the premium hike in one go with a bigger loan.\\nThis is not a new issue and I am aware that the Government stated in a Parliamentary Question reply to my colleague, the hon Louis Chua, last year that there is no evidence that PHC companies have caused the increase in COE prices. Be that as it may, as prices spiral out of reach of many Singaporeans who aspire or need to buy a car for different reasons, can we not do more to review how we can ensure that businesses, whether ride-hailing companies, car leasing companies or car dealers, do not push up the COE premiums at the peril of private buyers who need to buy a car for various different reasons.\\nSuch reasons can include using their vehicles for work purposes, taking care of their families with young children, taking care of elderly family members or handicapped family members. For some of these people, operating a private hire car from a ride-hailing company or using Grab or taxis may somehow not be a suitable substitute.\\nCan we also see to it that COEs for commercial vehicles are not subject to similar pressures? The rising COEs for this Category C have contributed to rising business costs and present further challenges for our smaller businesses. And added business costs also contribute to the increase in cost of living for everyone.\\nIn the past week, when we have been talking about combating stratification and building social compact amidst rising costs of living and rising property prices, we should be wary of the possible social effects of spiralling COE prices.\\nMr Speaker, I welcome and support the Minister for Transport\\'s statement in the addendum to the President\\'s Address, that the Ministry of Transport (MOT) will further encourage the adoption of cleaner energy vehicles through regulation, incentives and infrastructure. Indeed, President Halimah stated in her address that we have committed to decisive action to reduce carbon emissions and are taking resolute steps towards meeting our net-zero commitments.\\nThe Minister also said that we will review financial incentives to encourage the adoption of electric cars and monitor related developments in other vehicle segments, such as motorcycles and goods vehicles. To date, the pricing of electric vehicles is still relatively unattractive, compared to internal combustible engine (ICE) vehicles. I agree that the Government should further review to see how we are better able to encourage and incentivise more people to switch to Electric Vehicles (EVs) and reducing the number of new ICE vehicles on the road.\\nMr Speaker, a recent CNA article dated 11 April 2023 reported that parallel importers face limits in what EVs they can put on the road as compared to the authorised dealers, as this is partly because of how road tax is calculated, which is pegged to the EV\\'s power rating. One importer reported encountering problems with the homologation and/or registration for EVs. It was also reported that EV models with dual electric motors require proper documentation from manufacturers that confirm their power rating and this makes it tougher for parallel importers to register these cars for road use as, unlike authorised dealers, they do not have direct contact with the car makers. Another importer stated that EV options are quite limited for parallel importers and they hope for, I quote, \"better support in terms of clarity on importing rules\".\\nI hope the Government can look into the concerns of these parallel importers to clarify and review the rules and documentary requirements for EV sales and registrations, which may be more disadvantageous to parallel importers. More importantly, I hope the Government can provide more assistance to parallel importers to encourage them to focus on getting higher volumes of EV sales as opposed to ICE vehicles.\\nMr Speaker, still on transition to EVs, I next move to the issue of the electrification of logistics vehicles. In my Budget debate speech in February this year, I expressed my concern that it remains unclear how soon certain logistics fleets, including but not limited to light goods vehicles, will be switching to EVs entirely and I said that a number of prominent logistics companies have not yet had any plans or have not announced any plans for EV conversion or some have preliminary plans for only limited initial conversion.\\nIndeed, I have brought up my concerns for the green transition in last-mile logistics and asking for our plans for conversion of goods and logistics vehicles variously in the Committee of Supply (COS) Debate 2022 with the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, and during the debate for the EV Charging Bill in November 2022. In the MOT COS debate last month, I also asked whether the Government will actively engage logistics companies directly on their plans to convert to EVs and to speed up the process.\\nSenior Minister of State Amy Khor replied that, and I quote: \"on logistics companies\\' transition to cleaner vehicles, we are working with them, but it is now limited by the availability of this kind of vehicles in terms of technology\".\\nSir, during the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE)\\'s COS debate in 2022, I have already said that we have also seen electric light commercial vehicle models increasingly being rolled out by manufacturers, such as Renault, Opel and BYD. More recently, we read that, in the US, Schneider has delivered its first short-haul logistics EV trucks while Tesla has also delivered EV trucks to PepsiCo.\\nMr Speaker, while I appreciate MOT\\'s efforts to engage our logistics companies in this area thus far and, admittedly, some manufacturers may have only started to build such electric commercial vehicles not too long ago. I hope the MOT will increase its engagement with logistics companies to persuade them to have step plans for the conversions. I hope MOT will have a dedicated roadmap on the conversion of the logistics and goods vehicle fleet operating in Singapore in the next few years and will work closely together with logistics companies on such a roadmap.\\nMr Speaker, during the EV Charging Bill debate in November last year, I also mentioned that we have a large number of goods vehicles which are coming from Malaysia on a daily basis. I hope the Government will have a plan to handle this large group of foreign ICE vehicles coming into Singapore and travelling all over Singapore every day even if this may take even more time, given that they are foreign vehicles. Yes, we may need the goods and supplies these goods vehicles bring in every day, but it will be good to know that the Government has a plan in respect of these vehicles even if it may involve foreign government or agencies. We should not let their emissions delay our zero emission goals indefinitely.\\nMr Speaker, I also like to congratulate MOT and Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) for the launch of the first electric ferry, the Penguin Refresh on Monday, to carry Shell workers, contractors and visitors between Shell\\'s Pulau Bukom premises and Pasir Panjang Ferry Terminal.\\nIt is also commendable that MPA is working with Shell to allow other electric harbour craft to access their electric charges in due course. This is a first big step in the decarbonisation of the harbour craft fleet in the Port of Singapore. Under MPA\\'s maritime decarbonisation blueprint working towards 2050, all harbour craft will operate on low carbon energy solutions such as blended biofuels, for example, the B100 fuel or hybrid diesel electric propulsion by 2030 and by 2050 will operate on full electric propulsion of net zero fuels in order to achieve 15% reduction of 2021 levels by 2030 and 50% of 2021 levels by 2050.\\nI support these plans and I hope we can achieve the targets ahead of time.\\nIn the course of my professional work over the years, I had to use harbour launches to board vessels lying in nearby anchorages over the years and I hope the familiar smell of the engine fuel of the old harbour launches will be a thing of the past. In fact, I can remember in the past, I would have to pick one of the many harbour launches lying alongside Clifford Pier, effectively like water taxis and the pierced smelling of the fumes.\\nMr Speaker, while it is noteworthy that Shell estimates that it can save more than 6,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year, the ferry operation is far from being the mainstay of Shell\\'s business.\\nIn my Budget debate\\'s speech on 2022, I mentioned that Shell had in November 2021 announced that it was halving its crude processing capacity at its Singapore hub and reducing fuel exports. The oil major, a major part of our oil and gas industry, is intending to transit from fossil fuels to cut emissions and meet global low carbon energy needs. I acknowledge that this is part of a wider global trend in a transition towards low carbon fuels and undoubtedly, will affect Singapore in some ways.\\nMr Speaker, I hope the Government will continue to update the House on the transformation of our petrochemical sector on a green transition process in this sector, whether Singapore will continue to attract and retain parts of the petrochemical industry in Singapore. They are relevant for the green economy. I hope the Government will provide updates on our efforts in attracting more businesses in areas like biofuel refining or sustainable aviation fuel production or storage for such fuels as well as updates on carbon capture and sequestration at petrochemical plants.\\nAnd finally, I hope the Government will continue to update the House on the just transition in manpower for our workers working in Shell and other companies in the petrochemical sector, what we are doing to retain and retrain workers in this sector as the sector transforms within Singapore. Mr Speaker, I support the Motion of thanks to the President.\\nMr Speaker: Mr Pritam Singh.\\n12.49 pm\\nMr Pritam Singh (Aljunied): Mr Speaker, the Government\\'s direction as encapsulated by the President\\'s Address continues in the same vein from the last term of Parliament. A significant part of the information contained in the addenda to the President\\'s Address has been made known previously even before Parliament was prorogued. The WP Members of Parliament (MPs) have therefore raised issues that remain at the top of the public mind, such as HDB matters, the cost of living issues that affect seniors and the young and matters of fairness and inclusivity.\\nFor my part, I will cover three broad points.\\nFirst, I will speak about foreigners in Singapore and restate my call to the Government to ensure that our foreign talent policies translate to tangible benefits for Singaporeans.\\nSecondly, I will revisit my call for proficiency in English as a requirement for new Permanent Residents (PRs) and new citizens.\\nThird, I will address the Deputy Prime Minister\\'s remarks on the WP as an opposition that seeks to chip away at the people\\'s trust in Government. I will also address the Deputy Prime Minister\\'s questions to the WP concerning the Goods and Services Tax and list several policy proposals made by the WP, which have been adopted by the Government.\\nFirst, foreigners in Singapore. WP MPs know from our engagement with the public that a unique Singapore identity – proud and distinctive – has formed but continues to evolve. Insofar as a new social compact is concerned, Singaporeans seek a fairer, more inclusive and more caring society. The Government recognises this and my colleagues have signposted areas where these objectives can be operationalised.\\nIn his addendum, the Minister in-charge of the Strategy Group under the Prime Minister\\'s Office, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence has committed to carefully manage foreign worker and immigration flows to ensure that these translate into tangible benefits for Singaporeans and separately, to help newcomers integrate better into society.\\nWith respect to tangible benefits for Singaporeans, the WP has made that specific point repeatedly and we continue to see it as an important requirement to ensure society remains welcoming of foreigners. \\nThe WP has also made calls for a report card on the Industry Transformation Maps and job outcomes for Singaporeans. The publication of outcome-based indicators of Government policies would be useful tools in ensuring continued public support or at least understanding of the Government\\'s foreign talent policies. Providing evidence of how foreign talent policies help Singaporeans in concrete ways will help prevent xenophobia, something we must always guard against.\\nTo this end, it is useful for me to restate the point the WP made on the Parliamentary debate on free trade agreements and the India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) in September 2021, a point that Minister Ong Ye Kung brought up yesterday. As that debate proved, getting the People\\'s Action Party (PAP) Government to reveal information on the number of intra-corporate transferees from India that worked in Singapore upon the introduction of CECA was like squeezing blood out of a stone.\\nParliamentary questions had been filed by the WP on the issue from 2016 but forthright answers were not forthcoming. In the meantime, pressures and tensions on the ground built up as a small number of Singaporeans became emotionally charged about CECA, using it as an adjective and in very uncharitable and downright racist ways. The WP sought information, answers to which could have shed light and reduced heat before things reached a boiling point. Unlike as suggested by Minister Ong yesterday, sometimes filing a parliamentary question does not guarantee receiving an adequate and substantive answer from the PAP Government from which alternatives can germinate.\\nMoving forward another potential tinder box that the Government should look at closely is the growth of family offices, inflows of foreign wealth and how Singaporeans are taking to these developments. There are already murmurings of discontent that are led by emotional perspectives, created by facts such as the mass buying spree of properties in single developments by foreigners. If the Government does not step in early and fill the information vacuum on how outcomes for Singapore and Singaporeans are enhanced, this subject may turn ugly too and it would be important for the Government to be on top of this.\\nIn future, the PAP must not see calls for information as a Trojan horse for ulterior motives or a red herring. When there are requests for detailed figures, the PAP must not turn defensive in response to the Parliamentary Opposition of the day playing its role checking the Government of the day.\\nIn moving this Motion, MP Mr Murali Pillai stated that we must recognise that the nature of the electorate is changing and today, a new generation is emerging – standing taller and brighter than the ones before. He also said, and I quote, \"People\\'s psyche will change and as they do, the Government must change to a degree and at a speed unprecedented.\" Likewise, the interventions of the Opposition in this House, the questions it asks and the proposals it advances must reflect this new psyche.\\nGoing forward, the 4G PAP Leadership cannot be dismissive or breezily use national security or sensitivity as reasons for withholding information without good reason. In fact, I foresee that a greater openness to releasing information will be fundamental to the refreshed social compact that the 4G Leadership seeks to forge with Singaporeans through the Forward Singapore exercise. \\nOn the point of the Prime Minister\\'s Office\\'s Strategy Group\\'s addendum covering better integration of newcomers into society, I had proposed an English requirement for PRs and citizenship applications in last month\\'s Committee of Supply debate. A few weeks later, in a demographically representative poll of 500 Singapore-born citizens aged between 18 and 69, a CNA MediaCorp survey reported on 3 April this year, this month by CNA found that almost 80% were in favour of an English test for new PRs and citizens.\\nPrior to the release of the survey result, in some limited quarters, the proposal for an English requirement was incorrectly understood as a divisive one with the implicit point being that mother tongue languages would somehow be compromised or that an English requirement was actually a test for \"Singaporeaness\". But these criticisms missed the key point of the proposal, which was focused on integration. I am gratified that the demographically representative survey respondents did not miss the point.\\nThe wide support for an English requirement, as shown by the survey, can perhaps be traced to the historical use of English in Singapore, as established by the Pioneer Generation of PAP leaders. In the 2012 publication, Singapore\\'s Bilingual Journey, the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew said, and I quote, \"When Singapore celebrated its 21st National Day on the 9th of August 1986, it also celebrated a different sort of milestone. It was the first-time emcees of the event used English to lead the audience, where before they had to use three languages – Mandarin, Malay and Tamil. The crowds, likewise, responded in English. Where before the different races in Singapore were like different tanks of fish in an aquarium together before your eyes but segregated from one another, now they have a common language linking them together. They still retained their mother tongues whether Chinese, Malay or Tamil? But a common knowledge of English enabled them to share together the joys of the occasion. I was a proud man that day.\"\\nOn the occasion of the 100th year of his birth, this year, those words of the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew are timely. The late Prime Minister was clear. English would be a functional language with which to access the knowledge of the world and a tool for survival. The mother tongue is the cultural language used to transmit the culture\\'s traditional values. More than three decades since his words in 1986, Singaporeans understand that immigration is necessary to top up our population but they also instinctively appreciate the importance of a lingua franca for better integration with newcomers and the signal it sends of Singapore as a multi-racial and multicultural nation not just in form, but in substance. So, no one should be surprised at advocacy for our lingua franca, namely English, to bind Singaporeans together. At the same time, however, we must never sever our cultural roots. All of us must remain proud and celebrate our individual cultures, including our mother tongues.\\nOne legitimate concern, however, is the possible difficulty of an English requirement for foreign spouses who apply for PR or citizenship. Sir, WP – in its 2020 manifesto – called for the fast-track naturalisation of foreign spouses on the Long-Term Visit Pass Plus (LVTP+), subject to certain conditions, such as having at least one Singaporean child. I would suggest that an English requirement for foreign spouses can be one of the criteria for fast-tracking these applicants. My proposal calls for, all other things being equal, that additional points or consideration be given for PR and citizenship to foreign spouses who have a working proficiency in English. As the Government has openly stated, our immigration policy and immigration intake is calibrated to preserve the racial balance and by extension, an English requirement would not favour one racial group over another just because applicants in one racial group already use English and the other does not. \\nSir, a fast-track for foreign spouses would give families in Singapore with one Singaporean spouse much peace of mind. In effect, for foreign spouses, the English requirement would serve as a plus one criteria or bonus criteria. It would nudge and better align immigration policy with our bilingualism policy, which is a fundamental aspect of the Singapore system. For the record, this WP proposal does not contradict any of the eight principles of Singapore\\'s bilingualism policy established by the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew.\\nMr Speaker, the Singaporean identity continues to mature. For a young nation, this is a positive force. One that instinctively drives us towards inclusivity. It is wholly consistent with the values professed by the Government\\'s agenda that seeks, and I quote, \"a deepening of Singaporeans\\' sense of shared identity and mutual responsibility towards one another\".\\nI hope the Government can explore the best ways to reinforce the importance of English as a common language in our daily life, as it makes a big difference to the lived experience of many Singaporeans. The signalling effect on the centrality of our multiracial and multicultural society is immense. \\nSir, let me move on to my third point. I did not expect the Deputy Prime Minister to use his speech on the President\\'s Address to attack and accuse the WP of advancing opportunistic or populist ideas to chip away, bit by bit, the trust in Government. The PAP shifted its position yesterday in the course of the debate. when Minister Ong Ye Kung conceded that the WP have brought up many good ideas. But both Ministers were consistent in calling for the Opposition to present an alternative agenda and even an alternative Budget. I will deal with this point in the course of my speech.\\nTo address Deputy Prime Minister Wong, if all we were doing was putting forward populist, unrealistic policies, we would not see the Government actively considering some variation of the WP manifesto ideas on anti-discrimination legislation, minimum wage and redundancy insurance. If chipping away at trust in the Government was our real agenda, we would not see the Minister for National Development (MND) acknowledging the WP point highlighting the inherent inequity of the Housing and Development Board (HDB) taxpayer subsidies as currently applied between mature and non-mature Build-to-Order (BTO) flats.\\nIt is a most unfair charge levelled at the WP which, in reality, chips away at the integrity of our Parliamentary democracy as an important platform for the exposition and contestation of ideas. In fact, we welcome the PAP taking up WP points because the real beneficiaries are not the WP or the PAP – but the people of Singapore. \\nMr Speaker, please allow me to list just a few of our policy proposals to demolish this idea that the WP has not put forward serious alternatives. \\nNumber one, verifying educational qualifications of Employment Pass (EP) holders. In our 2020 General Election manifesto, we called for the introduction of Employment Pass credentials assessment. We said that all Employment Pass and S Pass job applicants with university degrees and diplomas should be subject to mandatory educational credentials assessments, with cost to be borne by the applicant. On 1 March this year, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) announced that companies in Singapore would need to verify the educational qualifications of Employment Pass applicants from 1 September 2023.\\nNumber two, broadcast Parliamentary Sittings live. In our 2020 and 2015 General Election manifestos, we called for the live, unedited broadcasts of Parliamentary Sittings. From 4 January 2021, Singaporeans were able to view livestreamed sessions of Parliament.\\nNumber three, national hydrogen strategy. Aljunied Group Representation Constituency (GRC) Member of Parliament (MP) Gerald Giam called for a national renewable hydrogen strategy in Parliament in January 2022 during the Motion on a low carbon society and again during Budget 2020. On 25 October the same year, the Energy Market Authority (EMA) announced that Singapore was launching a national hydrogen strategy to accelerate the transition to net zero emissions and to strengthen energy security.\\nNumber four, equalised maternity leave of 16 weeks for single unwed mothers. In our 2011 and 2015 General Election manifestos, we called for equitable support for single parents. In our 2011 manifesto, we stated that while having children outside of marriage should continue to be discouraged in our society, children born to single parents should not be denied the benefits that children of married parents receive. The children are innocent parties and should not start life being disadvantaged. We said that single parents should receive the same parenthood benefit packages as married parents.\\nIn our 2015 manifesto, we reiterate our call to grant single and wet mothers the full 16 weeks of paid maternity leave. In addition, we argue that single mothers should be made eligible for both the Working Mother\\'s Child Relief (WCMR) as well as the Foreign Domestic Worker Levy (FDWL) relief. Excluding single mothers from these schemes unnecessarily penalises vulnerable children and single mothers. We added that the Government should extend the same help to single fathers. On 9 November 2016, the Government announced that from January 2017, unmarried mothers would have 16 weeks of paid maternity leave, equal to their married counterparts and fathers would have two weeks of paid paternity leave.\\nNumber five, BTO priority and forfeiture for non-selection. In our 2015 General Election manifesto, we called for the \"three-tries BTO\". We proposed that first-timer BTO applicants on the fiancé-fiancée scheme be given priority up to their third try in selecting a flat so as to minimise the waiting time for couples to buy a flat and plan for starting a family. We called for the priority to be forfeited if the first timer BTO applicants were invited to select a flat in any one of their previous tries but did not book a flat.\\nOn 2 March this year, the Government announced that first-time BTO applicants who give up their chance to select a flat would lose their priority status. From the August 2023 BTO exercise, first timers who fail to choose a flat once will be deemed second timers for a year in the computer ballot. Second timers who accumulate one non-selection count, down from the current two counts, will have to wait one year before they can apply for flat again.\\nNumber six, impose a charge for the use of plastic bags. In our 2020 General Election manifesto on curbing the use of plastics, we called for the introduction of a single-use plastic charge, phased in over five years to encourage a reduction in plastic waste while looking for alternatives. This is what we said: the value of the charge would need to be sufficiently high to change behaviours but remains sensitive to the needs of lower socioeconomic groups and persons with disabilities. We called for a nationwide public education campaign to raise awareness of the effects of single-use plastics and other more sustainable alternatives. On 2 March this year, the Government announced a plastic charge at most Singapore supermarkets from 3 July 2023, with two-thirds of all supermarkets imposing a charge of at least five cents for each carrier bag.\\nNumber seven, one family paired to one General Practitioner (GP). In our 2015 General Election manifesto seven years ago, the WP called for the family doctor pairing scheme. We argue that pairing families with GPs would encourage patients to remain with one family doctor who would be more familiar with their background and medical history. This would facilitate earlier detection of illnesses, provide more accurate diagnosis, reduce duplication of treatment and improve coordination with other care providers. We proposed all resident families be paired with a GP near their home and that Singaporeans could be given the option to change their assigned GP. \\nIn October 2022, this House debated the Healthier SG White Paper, which among other things put forward the Government\\'s proposal for one family physician and one health plan for everyone. Under the plan, each resident chooses the family doctor or clinic. Flexibility will be provided for residents to change their enrolled doctor if they need to do so.\\nNumber eight, flexible work arrangements. In our 2015 General Election manifesto seven years ago again, the WP called for the fair regulation of mandatory flexi-work arrangements, where companies should be obliged to cater for a work-life friendly environment for workers. We suggested that employees who work for a company with more than 20 employees for more than six months should be allowed to make requests for flexible working arrangements. Employers could refuse the request on reasonable business grounds but must discuss the options available with the employee. The discussion must be duly documented and employees may appeal the refusal if there is a dispute on the grounds for refusing a request. \\nWe also called for tax breaks and enhanced work-life grants to be made widely available to help companies accommodate the flexi-work arrangements relevant to their respective industries. In the course of this debate no less, Minister of State Gan Siow Huang has reiterated that to entrench flexible work arrangements, MOM and the Tripartite Partners will introduce a set of tripartite guidelines by 2024. The guidelines would require employers to consider requests for flexible work arrangements fairly and properly. \\nSir, this is a non-exhaustive listing of the WP\\'s alternative proposals. \\nThere are of course proposals that were long advanced by the WP MPs, for example, on criminal legal aid which was strenuously rejected by the PAP. For example, on criminal legal aid, the PAP\\'s long-standing position was that it could not accept the taxpayer simultaneously funding both the prosecution and criminal defence. But they shifted positions and criminal legal aid finally became a reality in the last session of Parliament. \\nWhen the WP raised the matter of anti-discrimination laws and redundancy insurance, the PAP similarly offered many reasons why it could not be done then or were unmoved and not persuaded, only to shift its position later and take up the suggestion. \\nOne specific point which the Deputy Prime Minister reopened in this debate was the GST and the WP\\'s approach to it. This is rather strange because the debate over the last few years has been about the GST hike and not the GST per se.\\nEven so, as the Deputy Prime Minister spoke on Monday, I wondered why the Deputy Prime Minister would want to raise the GST question at this debate because those questions ought to have come during the Budget debate. Had the question on the WP position on the GST per se been asked then, the answer would have been obvious. The WP policy positions cannot be immutable and have to evolve with the political realities of the time. We may not have supported the GST when it was first introduced decades ago but we recognise it as part of the system. But accepting the GST as it stands does not mean accepting every GST hike put forward by the Government. \\nThe WP went into the last general elections opposing the hike in the GST. We did not ask for the removal of the GST completely since the GST has been an endemic feature about tax system for many years now. At least from the time I entered this House, the WP\\'s position concerned the necessity of GST hikes because the GST hurts the poor and middle class the hardest.\\nMr Speaker, Singaporeans know that no GST offset package lasts forever. Singaporeans are also acutely aware that a 1% increase in GST this year does not mean that the prices of goods and services will only rise by 1%. As we all know, for the men and women on the street the rise can be compounded many times, especially for basic things. Even with the Government\\'s newly enhanced permanent GSTV scheme in 2022 by MOF\\'s own reckoning, for low-income households who do not have elderly members, the GSTV scheme will offset about half of their total GST expenses. \\nI am aware that in February this year, the GSTV cash component of the GSTV scheme was increased by up to $350. However, I have not been able to find an MOF statement that sets out in parallel how much this increase will offset the total GST expenses for a low-income family without elderly members.\\nSir, the WP\\'s view is that if there are options to stave off this 1% or 2% rise in GST to fend off concomitant price rises in basic things like food at the coffee shop or hawker centre for the men and women on the street, as a responsible Opposition that has the welfare of Singaporeans at heart, the WP has to ask – why not consider them? And debate them? That is what we must be expected to do in this House rather than just accept whatever the PAP says.\\nThe Deputy Prime Minister does not want the WP to relitigate the alternative ideas we raised to make up the GST hike by saying that the sums do not add up. I believe when he says this, he means the sums do not add up if you want to remove the GST completely.\\nBut the Deputy Prime Minister would be acutely aware that this House was never debating the total removal of the GST in the last session of the Parliament, nor have we been doing so as long as the Deputy Prime Minister has been in this House.\\nThis is a distraction and the PAP should be upfront about it since we have been clearly talking about the GST hike from 7% to 9%, and what alternatives there are for it. \\nI would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether the Government still intends to proceed with the GST hike from 8% to 9% next year or whether it would consider a pause in view of persisting inflationary and cost of living pressures; and secondly, to accommodate changes to our corporate tax receipts that will inevitably crystalise further in the wake of BEPS 2.0. This is especially since the Government has announced at this year\\'s Budget that it would implement a domestic top-up tax that will raise multinational enterprise groups\\' effective tax rate in Singapore to 15% in 2025 – less than two years from now.\\nShould the corporate tax revenues look respectable and sustainable for the short to medium term without any real compromise in our attractiveness to foreign investors, it may not be necessary to introduce another hike to the GST from 8% to 9% for 2024, if corporate tax revenue, which contribute 25% of our tax revenues today, goes up further.\\nSir, the WP\\'s interventions, including our proposals of alternatives to the GST hike, seek better outcomes for Singaporeans. If our agenda was rank opportunism or populism, as suggested by the Deputy Prime Minister, the people will reject our brand of politics. \\nBut many Singaporeans do not want the cause of the Opposition in Singapore to fail and instinctively recognise the importance of a rational, responsible and respectable political Opposition in this House. \\nFor that reason, the public expectations of the outcomes in General Elections are not necessarily in synchrony with Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong\\'s point that every election from now will be about who forms the government.\\nWhat the Deputy Prime Minister is true in a theoretical sense. The elections are about who forms the government. But as the PAP itself likes to tout, Singapore is unique. The political reality in the Singaporean context – a combination of the first-past-the-post system, the size and footprint of Opposition parties, certain grassroots organisations\\' manned by PAP apparatchiks and an Electoral Boundaries Review Committee that comes under the Prime Minister\\'s Office, amongst other factors – all these reveal that the real prospect for a change of government during General Elections today, conceals the advantage of the PAP\\'s incumbency far more than the Deputy Prime Minister cares to let Singaporeans in on.\\nThe Deputy Prime Minister has asked us to be honest about our plans, policies and intentions. On the heady dreams of displacing the PAP and forming the government, the reality is the WP is a small party and we have a long way to go. Our medium-term objective is to ensure that one third of the seats in this House are not in the PAP\\'s hands. I said this in 2018 in a speech to WP\\'s members, which is publicly available under the \"Key Speeches\" section of the Office of the Leader of the Opposition website, and this was reported by the mainstream media.\\nWhy the significance of this figure of one-third and why is it important?\\nThe Constitution – the highest law of our land – which all other laws must take reference from, can only be changed if two-thirds of the MPs in this House agree. Should any political party with more than two thirds of the seats in this House decide to change the Constitution arbitrarily, there is nothing that can be done to stop them. \\nToday, the PAP does not just have a two-third majority, it has a supermajority of more than 75% of the seats. If we exclude Nominated MPs who cannot vote on constitutional changes, the total denominator is 93 elected MPs and two Non-constituency MPs. That brings the PAP\\'s supermajority at close to 90% today.\\nWe are not playing \"masak masak\" when we make changes to the Constitution. These are serious matters that involve the lives of Singaporeans to a very acute degree. In order to pass a constitutional amendment with a two-third majority, the PAP needs 63 votes in this House. The PAP has 83 MPs today. The PAP can even change the entire Constitution at one go, with 20 MPs to spare.\\nLet me give an illustration of how and why these numbers are important.\\nOn 21 March this year, just last month – in fact, exactly one month ago – the Parliament passed amendments to the Constitution. Some of the changes included amendments to Article 9, that sought to ensure that laws relating to the misuse of drugs that authorise the arrest and detention of any person for treatment and rehabilitation, remain valid under the Constitution. A separate change involved the introduction of a legal mechanism to reduce the balance of the Contingencies Fund so as to maintain discipline in how the Government manages its finances.\\nUnbeknownst to many members of the public and voters, there were only 67 MPs in the House present when that constitutional amendment was passed on 21 March last month. These 67 MPs included seven WP MPs.\\nIf all the WP MPs had not been present in the House at the time of the vote, the Constitution could not have been amended as sought by the PAP as only 60 PAP MPs were present. \\nI want to emphasise that the WP\\'s intention is not to block all the changes to the Constitution proposed by a PAP Government. Far from it. If constitutional amendments are in the interest of our people. we will support them. But if we assessed that the proposed changes to the Constitution are detrimental to Singapore and Singaporeans, we will speak against them and vote against them.\\nVoting against Constitutional amendments is not something that PAP MPs will be able to do if their party whip is not lifted. They can talk all they like in this House and go to the ends of the earth claiming to make a principled stand, but they cannot vote other than how the PAP leadership dictates.\\nSir, the WP seeks an evolution of Singapore\\'s politics towards a permanent presence of elected Opposition MPs so as to ensure sufficient balance in our political system against an extraordinarily dominant PAP. We do not seek a revolution that includes a change of government at this stage of Singapore\\'s political development. Based on my reading, this view is consistent with the general public\\'s sentiment.\\nBut the PAP should not rest on its laurels because this can change and it is because of that question that has been asked before – what if a rogue government sprang from the bosom of the PAP?\\nThe PAP knows that as long as the WP is not in government, it will never have the full breadth of considerations and access to detail the PAP is privy to – Cabinet briefings and papers, access to hundreds of classified public surveys and, of course, the intellectual and operational engine of the Civil Service. \\nSo, the Deputy Prime Minister demands that we come up with a serious alternative agenda and an alternative budget at this stage, knowing that there is a more than likely chance we will inevitably fall short on details, owing to obvious information asymmetries. And come election time, the PAP can tell the public that no serious alternatives have been presented. \\nBut where we have alternative ideas, we have advanced them. We will continue to do so, in spite of the political realities. We have been open with Singaporeans and nailed our flag to the mast in the course of campaigning for the people\\'s votes to put us in Parliament. Our manifestos have not been an amalgamation of broad statements of purpose and glossy pictures, but specific proposals with a view to better the lives of Singaporeans. \\nIf these proposals that I have highlighted earlier were not serious, why did the PAP take them on board and devote fiscal resources to fund them and policy resources to implement them?\\nAt its core, Mr Speaker, respectfully, what the Deputy Prime Minister has to appreciate is that the public expectations of the WP in Parliament as elected MPs differ from the PAP\\'s expectations from the WP – and rightly so. \\nFor many Singaporeans, the key operative consideration in making their vote count goes far beyond and transcends just a change of government. There are real political questions the voters have to consider, which they are acutely aware of.\\nFirstly, Singaporeans want an Opposition to check the PAP because in their heart of hearts, we all know that \"ownself check ownself\" is not realistic. The inherent nature of power makes this unrealistic. \\nSecondly, it is in our collective self-interest that no one party can amend the Constitution – the highest law of our land – at will. So, it is wise to have at least one third of this House in a party or parties other than the PAP.\\nThirdly, in the same vein as the Prime Minister alluded to in his speech in this debate, Singapore\\'s future is not a given. It follows that no one can ignore the possibility of a rogue government springing from the bosom of the PAP. Our people should have real political options if or when that happens.\\nThese are the reasons why there should be a strong Opposition presence in this House even before we talk of a change of government, alternative agendas and alternative budgets. \\nIn fact, PAP MP Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim said in the course of this debate, \"Iron sharpens iron. The rigours of debates and contestation of ideas on issues that are important to Singaporeans can help all of us formulate new ways forward for Singapore.\" He could not have put it better.\\nAt some point, in the name of inclusivity and a united Singapore in the face of grave external challenges, I hope the PAP can rise above political partisanship and acknowledge the political contribution of the WP towards the betterment of Singapore and Singaporeans.\\nIn conclusion, Mr Speaker, just as the President has set out the direction the Government is taking, let me set out the approach of the WP for this second session of Parliament of the Government\\'s term. \\nThe WP\\'s approach involves an acceptance that the political reality in Singapore is the overwhelming dominance of the PAP today. Part of that PAP\\'s supremacy comes from the performance of the PAP in delivering what citizens want, especially in the early decades of Singapore\\'s self rule, then Independence. \\nPart of that dominance has also come from hardball political tactics that also hosted policies with collateral purposes that suppressed the growth of an Opposition such as politicising ostensibly community-focused organisations such as the People\\'s Association, which does the bidding of even unelected advisors.\\nWhat is the appropriate response to such dominance? Some believe, perhaps naively, that it is best to work within the system, to change things from within the establishment.\\nIs that a realistic possibility? Perhaps it is. If you make it to one of a handful of top positions. \\nBut even the late President Ong Teng Cheong, who was very close to the top of PAP politics as deputy prime minister and seemingly right at the top of our political hierarchy as President, could not get the information he wanted. How much less realistic then for those lower down the establishment\\'s pecking order to achieve substantive goals for change?\\nThe alternative in responding to PAP\\'s dominance is to appeal directly to the people – by contesting in elections and leaving it to the voters and having faith in their judgement. This is the path the WP, its MPs, members and volunteers have chosen. \\nSo, the direction the WP must take while in Parliament is to worthy of the votes that have put us in Parliament. Just as the Government is essentially continuing its last term and also the previous session of Parliament, so are we. We will continue to raise alternative proposals within the limits of our resources and the information we have or is made available.\\nWe will be glad to see the PAP implement policies we have suggested, whether they say that those ideas were already in their pipeline or whether they merely adopt them without attribution. But most critically, no matter the challenge or obstacle, the Opposition must be focused and continue to endeavour, work for and defend the interests of Singaporeans and Singapore, as equal and fellow Singaporeans, together in the same boat, rowing in the same direction, be it in or out of this House. [Applause.]\\nMr Speaker: Minister Tan See Leng.\\n1.29 pm\\nThe Minister for Manpower and Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng): Mr Speaker, thank you. I would like to seek a point of clarification to Mr Pritam Singh\\'s speech earlier on. In his speech, he said that asking the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) to release statistics is like drawing blood from a stone.\\nI want to highlight the point that on his question on the number of intra-corporate transferees, on 6 July 2021, in the Ministerial Statement, I had already provided the numbers. There were 4,200 intra-corporate transferees working in Singapore the year before – that is, 2020 – a number that has remained consistently small. And, of course, the rest of it is available in the Hansard. It is also published in The Straits Times as well. \\nI think the point to highlight to everyone, every Member of the House and particularly in response to your statement is that many of the questions that were asked – both by the WP as well as by the PSP – were not just on the numbers pertaining to intra- corporate transferees. But the Member has also put the questions together on the breakdown of whether the jobs went to Singapore Citizens who were born in Singapore or who were naturalised Singaporeans, amongst other types of confidential information that was not readily released.\\nNotwithstanding that, in the interest of addressing the issue in Parliament, to the best extent that is possible, our MOM officials came up to put the statistics up required by MPs. I hope that we can have this social compact – and let us make no mistakes about it that the vitriol and the raw emotions at that particular point in time, I hope was really something that we should all try to avoid. And I hope that they were not due to other factors outside of what the questions were intended to be. And I hope that they were not due to deliberate efforts to frustrate our social compact. \\nTo the Member\\'s point about the confidential information that could have been released earlier, I believe that it cannot be the reason for the ugly xenophobia, the racial undertones surrounding CECA. I think that is the point that I would like to clarify.\\nMr Speaker: Mr Singh. \\nMr Pritam Singh: Thank you, Mr Speaker. Before I go into the nub of the matter as raised by the hon Minister for Manpower, in terms of the xenophobic elements which the Minister raised, we are at ad idem. We do not want our compact to be disrupted and overturned because of these reasons. So, to that extent, we are on the same page. \\nBut let me just share with the Minister that when I referred to the intra-corporate transferees, Minister would recall in the debate that Minister refers to, that the Parliamentary Questions were asked well before the answers that he gave in Parliament in July. Mr Leon Perera had – if my memory serves me correctly and I stand corrected, Mr Speaker, I am going based on memory alone – asked the question on the number of intra-corporate transferees in 2016. And the answer in Parliament from the Minister for Manpower was, \"we don\\'t reveal these numbers.\" And the point we were making – and the point I made in my speech again today – was if those numbers were released, because the numbers were low – they could have punctured all that xenophobia quite early. And the point I am making was I could not understand why it was difficult to provide the information in 2016. But then when things are descending into an abyss, the numbers start coming out.\\nI made this point earlier. I made this point in the course of that debate and this was then Minister Ong Ye Kung\\'s reply. I made the same point and there is no real difference in the point that I am making now. And this is what he said in my response to releasing information earlier: \"I take to heart what the Leader of the Opposition has said that, with information, we can quell such falsehoods much earlier. We work in a bureaucracy. Some data is classified secret, confidential and so on. So, we are not at liberty to always disclose them. But what you say is true. Some information, it is better for it to come out early and then we can move on, especially as you said when it concerns issues like racism or xenophobia, it is much better to credit early.\"\\nSir, I hope that response addresses the point put to me by the Minister for Manpower. I am suggesting that in certain issues of great significance, the Government is better off providing more information rather than less. \\nMr Speaker: Minister Tan See Leng.\\nDr Tan See Leng: First and foremost, given the low number of intra-corporate transferees and, as the Leader of the Opposition has persistently said that these are matters of national interest, it appears that in every single debate that we have, every single issue has now been put up as national interest. I am glad he acknowledges and he shares my point about having this common social compact. But I hope that in terms of perhaps prioritising some of these questions and having a more precise and surgical differentiated way of asking these questions could be one way of making it a lot easier.\\nMr Speaker: Minister Ong Ye Kung.\\nThe Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung): I was not intending to speak but the Leader of the Opposition mentioned my name a few times. What the Leader of the Opposition said in his speech, I think it was a similar point that he made in the July 2021 debate, which was that if only MOM released the number early, you could have quelled all the xenophobia. I took that point. \\nAnd my answer in July 2021, I think it is the same answer today. We take to heart the feedback that the Member gave. If we have released, perhaps, it would have quelled all the xenophobia and all the raw emotions. But as Minister Tan See Leng said, that data was graded confidential or maybe even secret, I am not sure. But it was not ready for release, because when you release intra-corporate transferees of a particular country, others may compare, it can have other ramifications. So, it is not something that Ministry officials will readily say, \"Let us release it for Parliament\". But the situation became like that. CECA became a big issue with a lot of raw emotions, got debated here. In the end, these Ministers had a serious discussion and said \"Let us release it\". And so, we take your point but it is not that straightforward a matter but nevertheless.\\nI think what Minister Tan See Leng is also trying to say is that after all this, let us not blame this whole debate and raw emotions around CECA on MOM because they never released intra-corporate transferee data. It is not because of that. No. If we are honest with ourselves, it is not because of that. It could have quelled it. But I think many other factors took place resulting in those raw emotions, which is most unfortunate.\\nMr Speaker: Mr Pritam Singh.\\nMr Pritam Singh: Mr Speaker, I actually did not intend to bring up this point in the course of my speech today. But because Minister Ong mentioned yesterday in the context of presenting alternative budgets, alternative agendas, he said, \"just file a question, you\\'ll get a written answer\". I think that caused me to pause. Because the answer that was given in 2016 – and again, I stand corrected if my memory fails me – was not that the reason we are not releasing the ICT data was because there could be commercial sensitivities and so forth. In fact, there was no reason given at all, if I am not wrong. It was \"We don\\'t release this figure, period\".\\nSo, again, I think the question really comes back down to thinking carefully about whether that information truly is going to be problematic and what is in our interests, given Singapore\\'s situation, given how some of these agreements can be problematic. And I have to add, again, I am going back six years. So, I remember the question of CECA did not just drop from the sky in 2015, 2016, 2017, around that period. Factually, the Government website, also had to come out and clarify some of these issues. So, in that context, I am not blaming MOM or pointing the finger at MOM, but making a larger meta point about how important it can be for information to be released and to take a different attitude towards it.\\nMr Speaker: Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.\\nThe Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Lawrence Wong): Sir, on the larger point that the Leader of the Opposition Mr Singh had highlighted, I am glad that he agrees with me that we do need both serious Government and serious Opposition in our maturing democracy. I made the point in my speech. He has a different view on the way I have characterised some of the proposals made by the Opposition. That is his view and I accept that. I think there we may well have to agree to disagree.\\nBut I made this broader point about how our democracy will evolve because I do worry when I look at how democracies elsewhere have evolved. Look at the great democracies of the world. Democracies far bigger, far more developed than us and look at where they are now – how their societies have become divided and polarised, how their systems have become stuck in gridlock. It is not as though their people are unloyal to their countries – not at all.\\nBut how is it that these countries have become so dysfunctional where politics is concerned? And what makes us so sure that Singapore is immune and we somehow can avoid such a fate happening in Singapore down the road? So, I think there are lessons for us. And the lessons are, if you look at many of these countries, populism has taken root and populism has damaged greatly their societies; divided and polarised their people.\\nWhat is populism? Populism is politics that suppresses the truth, shades the truth, gets into post-truth, distorts the facts for political advantage. Populism is politics that pretends there are simple answers to complex issues, because there are not. And if such populism were ever to take root in Singapore, well, in the short term, parties that push out such populist policies may gain some advantage, but in the longer term it will cause great damage to Singapore and Singaporeans.\\nSo, from the Government\\'s point of view, our stand is very clear. We reject all forms of populism. We make sure and we uphold honesty and integrity in policymaking. If the Government were ever to fall short of these standards, we expect the Opposition to call us out and say so. Please do. You have to do it. We expect you to do it.\\nConversely, if the Opposition were to propose ideas and policies that we feel are populist, we, likewise, will highlight them and highlight our concerns. Rightfully so.\\n So, I hope that is our common understanding of how we can take Singapore\\'s politics and democracy forward. Mr Pritam Singh said that Singaporeans believe in the cause of the Opposition and does not want the cause of the Opposition to falter and fade away. \\nI believe there is a role for the Opposition to play in our politics, in our democracy and it is a very important role to campaign for your ideas and your proposals to hold the elected Government to account and to offer serious alternatives to the Government. \\nMr Singh says it takes time and you are not ready to form the next Government. You take one step at a time, one-third. But in politics, things can happen very quickly.\\nSo, I am glad Mr Singh is mindful that there is an important role for the Opposition to play and I think he should start thinking about how he and the WP can, indeed, perhaps, not sitting on that side of the aisle, but on this side of the aisle in future, down the road. What sort of agenda you would offer Singaporeans and what you would do if you were to form the Government?\\nIf there is one thing that I hope all of us can take away from this debate and, given that there is, in fact, I would say, some common understanding of this, from what I hear from Mr Singh\\'s speech, one outcome that we might be able to say to Singaporeans, it is this: that together in this House, both sides of the House, we stand for a democracy that is maturing, a serious Government and a serious Opposition. We say yes to all that, but we say no to populism and political opportunism ever taking root in this House and in Singapore. [Applause.]\\nMr Speaker: Mr Singh. \\nMr Pritam Singh: Thank you, Mr Speaker. Let me just deal with the last point made by the hon Deputy Prime Minister. I do not think there is any difficulty for me or my colleagues to agree to that.\\nAnd I think that coming back to the Prime Minister\\'s speech, which I think a lot more Singaporeans should listen to, we know the future is not exactly smooth. There are a lot of unpredictable factors that we have to contend with and, in the course of debate in this House, we will be going back and forth at each other\\'s proposals and ideas.\\nBut insofar as populism and opportunism are concerned, I am quite certain that the Deputy Prime Minister means that it ought to work both ways. It cannot be a case of pointing fingers at the Opposition and accusing them of that when certain actions of ruling party politicians on the ground are no better.\\nBut having said that, I accept the Deputy Prime Minister\\'s concerns of our democracy and, certainly, the WP, and I hope the Opposition in general, will be mindful going forward and work towards the betterment of Singapore and Singaporeans. \\nMr Speaker: Mr Leong Mun Wai.\\nMr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member): Speaker, I would like to thank, first of all, the 4G leaders led by the Deputy Prime Minister, to have initiated this very frank discussion as to how our democracy is maturing and also what should be the way, how should be the way we work in Parliament. Unfortunately, I had been observing the proceedings at home for the last few days because of my family\\'s medical problems; and I also thank Speaker for being so indulgent in allowing me to have my absence.\\n First of all, I would like to say that the PSP is also very in agreement and supportive that in a maturing democracy, we need both a responsive Government and also an Opposition that can put up alternative policies. \\nHowever, I think what we have discussed so far in the debate is that there are two areas that we hope the Government would realise. One is, from the point of view of the PSP in the course of all my debates with the Government, is, one, data is really not enough. Two, which is quite obvious over the last few years from my experience in this Parliament, is the attitude of the Government towards the Opposition. And that point stands out very strongly, especially recently when the Deputy Prime Minister made the point that Opposition parties have not put up serious alternative agenda or policies. \\nSo, I would like to —\\nMr Speaker: Mr Leong, just to clarify, you are asking some clarifications?\\nMr Leong Mun Wai: Yes, yes. So, on the issue of data, can I ask the Manpower Minister, Dr Tan See Leng, that I was the one who initiated the job debate in 2021, and the purpose of initiating that debate is to really determine whether Singaporeans overall have been affected by the foreign talent policy or not. But until today, would the Minister agree that we do not have enough data to conclude with certainty that Singaporeans have not been displaced from the job market?\\nIn 2021, we raised this point that the Minister has claimed — I raise this point again that the Minister had raised the data that in the 15 years from 2005 to 2020, 380,000 PME jobs had been created for locals, which also include the Permanent Residents (PRs). But then we took the data and we looked at it, and then we asked, but this includes all the PRs in the definition of locals, right? So, during the same 15-year period, we have 650,000 new —\\nMr Speaker: Mr Leong, if I may ask, what is the clarification you are specifically asking for?\\nMr Leong Mun Wai: Yes, so, the Minister he has not provided enough data to prove conclusively that Singaporeans have not been displaced from the market. Can I ask that first question first?\\nMr Speaker: Minister Tan See Leng.\\nDr Tan See Leng: Mr Speaker, and to all Members of this House, I have consistently been providing the data. Perhaps the Member may not understand my overarching English, maybe the proficiency of my English. \\nToday, in Singapore, we are at full employment. Our long-term unemployment rate is at 0.6% to 0.7%. In fact, in my reports, as I have shared, for the year ending 2022, the number of resident employment, that means, locals – Singapore Citizens, PRs – resident employment has gone to even before pre-COVID-19 days, before 2019.\\n In all of my interventions, in all of my speeches, I have consistently shared that for the foreign talent that have come in, it has resulted in an increase in the number of jobs created and employment opportunities for Singaporeans. \\nThis is precisely my point earlier on to Mr Pritam Singh. When you want to go and dive into the data between whether that Singapore Citizen is born here or born elsewhere and then become naturalised, or how many generations, I think those kinds — no, no, I am not conflating it, Leader of the Opposition. I am not conflating. I am just saying, using it as an example to say that this is the type of data we do not release. So, I hope you do not conflate the entire discussions together. I rest my case. \\nMr Speaker: Mr Singh.\\nMr Pritam Singh: Thank you, Mr Speaker. Just for the record, I need to state this for the record because the WP never made a request for information on people born in Singapore. \\nSo, I just want to be very careful about that, because that gets us into very dangerous territory. \\nDr Tan See Leng: Thank you, thank you.\\nMr Speaker: Mr Leong Mun Wai.\\nMr Leong Mun Wai: Speaker, however, PSP disagrees. PSP thinks that —\\nMr Speaker: Mr Leong, this is not meant to be a debate on that particular issue. Your clarifications, please. You have other clarifications?\\nMr Leong Mun Wai: In that case, can we sort of agree to disagree here, that the Minister thinks that it is because the data is so sensitive, we cannot get into the bottom —\\nDr Tan See Leng: Point of order, Speaker. \\nMr Speaker: Minister Tan.\\nDr Tan See Leng: I was providing a point of clarification to Mr Pritam Singh\\'s speech. So, I hope that we can keep it as that. \\nMr Speaker: Mr Leong Mun Wai.\\nMr Leong Mun Wai: Speaker, I do not understand what is the meaning of that.\\nMr Speaker: Minister Tan See Leng, Mr Leong does not understand you.\\nMr Leong Mun Wai: Meaning I cannot ask a question? \\nDr Tan See Leng: Perhaps if he would like a separate debate, he can file another Parliamentary Question on the issue of the jobs statistics.\\nMr Leong Mun Wai: But, Speaker, just now I raised a clarification, right? So, the Minister had answered me. So, now, I ask for another clarification, that is okay, right?\\nMr Speaker: Yes. Please do. \\nMr Leong Mun Wai: In that case, can I clarify that we agree to disagree? You said that we cannot get into the breakdown of those numbers because you do not want to differentiate Singaporeans, naturalised Singaporeans, locals, PRs, all that. And, as a result, we cannot get to the bottom of whether Singaporeans have been displaced or not. \\nMr Speaker: Mr Leong, if I may, I think Minister Tan responded by explaining as to the employment situation in Singapore, as to how employment is being created. So, I think that was his response to your query about the displacement and so on. So, if you have further clarifications, please proceed. \\nMr Leong Mun Wai: Yes, Speaker, but I would like to make the point also that the unemployment data and overall employment figures sometimes can hide some of the other relevant information about what are the changes in the job market. \\nMr Speaker: And your clarification would be?\\nMr Leong Mun Wai: So, never mind, I will rest the case. Thanks. \\nMr Speaker: Ms Mariam Jaafar. \\n1.56 pm\\nMs Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang): Mr Speaker, I stand in the support of the Motion. I declare that I am the Managing Director and Partner of a management consulting firm that does work in the areas of digital, artificial intelligence and skills development.\\nAt the start of this Parliament term, I delivered my maiden speech titled \"The Nation that Learns the Fastest\". I spoke then about what I felt was needed for Singapore to thrive in a rapidly changing world: the importance of lifelong learning, the need for companies to take responsibility for their employees\\' learning, the need for companies to give more Singaporeans a chance and to look beyond paper qualifications, the need for stronger anti-discrimination protection, the need for each of us as leaders to go beyond telling people to be better, faster, work harder to providing emotional support, networks and social capital, and the need for companies to be better corporate citizens and proactively address critical social issues in order to earn the social licence to operate.\\nSo, it is with the greatest humility that I express my appreciation to the Government for the significant moves that have been made in the past two and a half years on each of these and the significant moves that will be made in the next two and a half years, some of which have been announced in the past weeks and days, and some that are yet to come but foreshadowed in the Forward SG conversations. I do not claim to be the first to bring forth any of these ideas. There is no such thing as a monopoly of ideas, but if my analysis and the voices of my residents and other Singaporeans that I have surfaced have had even a small impact on their thinking, I think the past two and a half years would have been well spent.\\nOn the announcements, there are a few areas where I would offer a slightly more nuanced view. Take, for example, the idea of supporting workers to take time off to train. The reality is, many companies, especially SMEs, find it challenging to give \"time off\" to train, and this is exacerbated by the experience that some SME owners have shared with me – that their employees do not seem to bring something useful back to the business after going for training, so, it is almost like sending them on a holiday. This is not good for employees either – the forgetting curve I referred to in my maiden speech tells us that they will quickly forget what they have learnt.\\nSir, it is really as Minister Chan Chun Sing has said before – business transformation and workforce transformation must go hand in hand. Decoupling training time and working time is less optimal than designing training to be integrated with their jobs while those jobs and the companies they belong to are being transformed. We have to push both, not separately, but together. An even more joined-up approach among the economic, workforce development and skills development agencies, would be incredibly useful.\\nBut, generally, the policy questions being considered and positions being taken address a lot of the preoccupations on my mind two and a half years ago. So, this could be a rather short speech, if the environment around us had not changed. \\nBut in that same two and a half years, some things have changed, or accelerated, significantly and suddenly. Prime Minister Lee and other Members have talked about the different storms and opportunities that preoccupy us today. I wish to speak today on one of these things that has become a preoccupation on my mind and that of many business leaders, that is, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence or AI, precipitated by the explosion of interest in generative AI.\\nGenerative AI has been developing quietly for some time, gaining attention in recent years with the launch of technologies, like DALL.E, Image Generation, Mind Journey, Stable Diffusion. But it got a massive shot in the arm with the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, which became the fastest growing app in history, reaching 1.6 billion visits in March. Suddenly, in the words of Andrei Karpathy, one of the founders of OpenAi, \"English is the hottest new programming language\" and anyone could access ChatGPT to generate the most likely output to any query and take advantage of its key distinguishing feature – the ability to generate new realistic content – text, image or video.\\nIn effect, generative AI has democratised AI – and when democratisation happens, revolution is usually swift to follow. Much as the launch of the first Web Browser MOSAIC in 1993 democratised the Internet and triggered the Internet revolution, ChatGPT and other generative AI technologies are triggering the AI revolution and will transform all industries and societies.\\nThe possibilities opened up by generative AI are well documented. The hon Member Dr Tan Wu Meng, and others have referenced some of these in their speeches this week. Generative AI enables greater productivity and the turbocharging of innovation to solve unsolved problems – in business, but also in education, in healthcare and in other areas that are going to help a lot of people. Insilico Medicine uses Generative AI to identify a novel drug candidate for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in just 21 days, compared to years in traditional drug discovery.\\nBut there are also a lot of risks and worries about generative AI and rightly so. Anyone who has used Chat GPT will know that the model can generate nonsense output. There are also real issues of output that is not factual or bias, due to bias in real world data. Businesses engaging in AI are grappling with the risk of data leaks, copyright infringement and uncontrollable shadow AI in their organisations. \\nCompanies and societies worry about socioeconomic displacement, the potential of job losses at an unprecedented scale, including of \"knowledge workers\" – marketers, lawyers, accountants, architects, developers, engineers, analysts, and, yes, even management consultants.\\nNo less worrying is the risk of ever more sophisticated phishing, deepfakes and fraud at the hands of bad people – cybercrime has never been easier! – the potential impact on security and defense, and the very institution of democracy itself. Then, there is the fact that a few companies control a large share of the technology, tech that is now moving from open source to proprietary ownership by companies with a for profit motive, leading to an AI arms race among companies and countries, for bigger and better algorithms, data, computing power and talent.\\nAnd what about the environment? If you thought Bitcoin\\'s energy consumption was bad, well, an Open AI study showed that the energy cost of training an AI algorithm is increasing at an exponential rate, which if it is continues, by 2027, in just four years, the largest model\\'s cost will surpass the GDP of the US.\\n Then, we have the speculative doomsday scenarios, where machines attain human level intelligence or artificial general intelligence (AGI), and take over the world, destroying humanity in the process. \\nSpeculative or not, so great is the worry, that the Future Life Institute put out a call for a six-month pause, or moratorium, on training AI models more powerful than Open AI\\'s GPT-4 model, and some very smart people have signed this proposal. In reality, we are further away from AGI than the recent hype may suggest. As Yann Le Cun of META put it, we humans are very language oriented. \"We think when something is fluent, it\\'s also intelligent, but it\\'s not true\". And I think that resonates with many of us.  \\n I will not go into the merits of the moratorium proposal – others much deeper in this field than me have opined on this, but as a believer in progress through knowledge, the idea seems unfruitful and impractical.  \\n For me, the real question is not, whether machines can attain human intelligence, or even when that might happen, but rather: how do we, as a country, best prepare for the eventual future and have a voice in influencing how it all develops to protect and advance our interests.\\n The time has come for governments to recognise that we are at a precipice and that they must act to determine the position they want to hold with respect to AI, the impact on their people and the required adaptations and the policies they must make going forward to ensure the effective and ethical development and deployment of AI and Generative AI.  \\nSingapore launched our National AI Strategy in 2019, which reflects our commitment to being a leader in developing and deploying scalable, impactful AI solutions, in key sectors of high value and relevance to our citizens and businesses along with five National AI Projects and five ecosystem enablers.\\nAI Singapore has partnered with businesses to nurture the development and adoption of AI models in key sectors like healthcare, transportation and finance. It also runs the AI Apprenticeship programme. In this year\\'s Committee of Supply (COS), Minister Josephine Teo, shared that AI Singapore will double the number of AI Apprentices trained over the next five years from 200 to 400. \\nAll this is good progress. But if we are standing at the precipice of an AI revolution, do we need to revisit the ambition, scope and pace of our national AI strategy and our AI policies, to avoid being left behind in the arms race, and to create more value for the world and for ourselves?\\n Today, I want to focus on two potential areas to double down on: one, building an AI and generative AI-ready people; and two, leading the way in promoting better and safer AI and generative AI development and deployment. \\nFirst, building an AI and generative AI-ready people. This AI revolution will have a massive impact on people and jobs. Four things we need to do.\\nFirst, anticipate. Anticipate how jobs will change in a generative AI world. Instead of creating content or code or preparing or processing documents, people will be supervising first drafts by AI while focusing more on strategic thinking, building customer relationships and developing more complex campaigns using AI tools. Some jobs will be eliminated. This is not new – we are used by now to technology disruption. But what is going to be different is the scale and speed at which this will happen. So, reskilling and reemployment, at scale, at speed, alongside managing the impact on people\\'s professional identity and self-esteem, is going to be a serious challenge. And we will need to face up to the possibility, the probability that some will be left behind and this will require a new tilt towards redistribution.\\nDuring this year\\'s Budget debate, I raised that the time may have come to consider retrenchment support and Deputy Prime Minister Wong suggested in his speech that targeted re-employment support is being considered. It is timely today, but think about what might be needed 10 years from now. We need to anticipate this and time the shifts appropriately.  \\n In making these shifts, I hope we will remember that AI itself could be part of the solution, removing some traditional trade-offs. For example, AI can help in personalised reskilling at scale. We could also look at using AI in social services to provide tailored social and reemployment support at scale – rather than compromising someone that tolerated for the sake of ease of implementation. While all this will require public trust in AI and public officer\\'s proper adoption of AI.  \\nSecond, develop. Develop talent for the range of AI roles required – data scientists, but also designers, engineers, ethicists and so on. Remember it is possible that AI will create as many jobs as it displaces. AI talent will be needed in business, academia and public service. And sorry, but we are not talking 400 people here. So, we will need training programmes at scale, at speed, to build a workforce that will be AI competitive 10 years from now.\\nThird, attract. Attract the global talent with the new skillsets for the new jobs that AI will create. I think we do not have to explain that.\\n And finally, engage. Engage Singaporeans to not fear this AI revolution, but to embrace it and this is a massive change management effort. I once received an email from a resident. He observed the challenges and stress that people have adapting to technology, and asked, why does Singapore have to move so fast to adopt the latest technology? Why are we so obsessed with becoming a Smart Nation? Why can we not make the choice to stick to low technology or non technology approaches on some things to make life easier for our people?\\n We need to make people understand it is not a matter of choice. The AI revolution will not wait for us. But we need to assure people that humans are not going anywhere – humans are needed to deploy AI effectively and ethically. We need to inspire people – it is not all about avoiding displacement – there are all these very exciting opportunities that a general purpose technology like generative AI allows the young and not so young, to find application in all facets of the economy, of life, that can create value for a lot of people and help a lot of people and that should be empowering.  And we need to monitor the pulse of our people and make interventions along the way.  \\nSecond, leading the way in promoting better and safer AI development and deployment. As Minister Ong said, responsible stewardship is a hallmark of our policy-making. AI governance and ethics is already a key pillar of the National AI strategy. Earlier in the day, Senior Minister of State Janil had talked about AI Verify and some of the tools that we have already developed by Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC). \\n But the many ethical and legal concerns that people have about AI point to the fact that research in AI governance and ethics has lagged other aspects like compute power. There are big questions yet unsolved on issues like liability in the event of harm or bias, like data protection, privacy protection. How to prevent ChatGPT from becoming a tool for spreading misinformation and bias? As we move towards to AGI, how to ensure that AI systems behave in ways that are aligned to human values will be critical to advancing the progress of AI.\\n So, regulation of AI is gathering momentum globally. More than 60 plus countries and territories are considering some 800 measures. Prominent among these is the EU AI Act, the first broad regulatory framework on AI, unveiled in 2021. The Act sets out different rules and bans certain practices and imposes stiff penalties, up to 6% of a company\\'s global revenues, for those in breach and the scope is global. But the rapid advances in generative AI show how difficult it is for regulations to keep up, with EU lawmakers struggling to reach consensus as to how to deal with them in the Act.  \\n In Singapore, the Model Governance Framework lays out principles, but not penalties. It seeks to build public trust and understanding and to balance innovation and protection. There is no AI specific regulation, but deployment of AI requires consideration of other existing regulations.\\nI think this approach is pragmatic, but some have wondered if it is too top down and does not do enough to ensure that responsibility cascades down the organisation. And others have asked if more regulatory power is needed given our status as a global financial and technological hub.  \\nSo, how could Singapore be of value to the world in this regard? One, invest in AI governance and ethics research; two, ensure ethical guiderails and legal protections keep up with the rapid advancements in generative AI; three, support businesses in setting up responsible AI programmes; and four, serve as a global reference point to contribute to the development of global standards. \\nGlobal standards are needed but difficult in a world where the global governance order is collapsing and on an issue that is so ideologically charged. But therein lies the opportunity for Singapore.\\nAs a colleague commented: \"Singapore\\'s middle ground between the East and West is uniquely interesting. The US or Western logic of absolute freedom of expression is hitting the limit of fake news at scale with generative AI. The Chinese over control is hitting the limit of tech progress\". He continued \"I find policy making in Singapore much more nuanced when approaching those questions. Less dogmatic. So for me, it brings legitimacy.\"\\n His comments raise an interesting question as to the role Singapore could play in leading a global effort. Whether we strengthen ethical guidelines or put more teeth with regulations and legal protections is something to be evaluated against the trade-offs between innovation and protection.\\nBut there can be more regrets in increasing understanding. How can we increase understanding and align others to work together to manage our common concerns? Forums with technology providers, civil society and governments help. Could the approach taken in dealing with online falsehoods and Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Regulations (POFMA) be something to consider – rigorous public hearings and a national debate to study the risks and issues and recommend strategies to deal with them? And hopefully, this time, we can all agree that it is for the common good and avoid its politicisation.  \\n Mr Speaker, the progress in AI is exciting and worrying at the same time. I agree with Dr Tan Wu Meng, that in a world of AI disruption, togetherness and trust is more important than ever before. But that alone is not enough. We need our AI strategies, policies and people to keep pace with the breathless development; so let us buckle up! [Applause.]\\n Mr Speaker: Mr Sitoh Yih Pin.\\n2.13 pm\\nMr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Motion. At the address for the Opening of the second session of the 14th Parliament last week, Mdm President spoke on the geopolitical and economic challenges we face on the horizon and the need to refresh our social compact. She also set out the Government\\'s agenda for the next half term of the 14th Parliament. \\nIn doing so, she reaffirmed the core values of Singaporeans: fairness, inclusivity, mutual support, equality and a sense of belonging for all regardless of background so that every Singaporean is afforded the opportunity to achieve his or her full potential.  \\nThese core values may appear intuitive to most Singaporeans in the context of the present day. It is almost like an unwritten code that forms part of the psyche of being a Singaporean.\\nAnd yet, we sometimes forget that these core values underpinning our social compact is not an inherent trait nor did it happen by chance. It is the result of hard work, deliberate effort and, dare I say, a lot of gumption and guts by our founding leaders in their efforts to build and forge social cohesion and unity among a diverse group of disparate migrant communities who have come to Singapore in search of a better future.\\nSir, in preparing to speak today, I chanced upon a speech that then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew gave on 11 December 1965 at Serangoon Gardens Circus.\\nIt was just after Independence – four months, in fact. Then-Prime Minister Lee was brutally frank and honest about the immense challenges that Singapore was facing post-Independence, but he also made it crystal clear the direction and values upon which Singapore was to be built upon moving forward.  \\nA part of his speech I thought summarised our social compact very well. He said, \"Anyway, the end result was that we were kicked out of Malaysia after two years. And I say that we make it succeed – from here. First, this belongs to all Singaporeans, regardless of race, language, religion. Second, when there is progress, we ensure that the progress is spread equally, regardless of race, language or religion. There will be the same schools for all, the same hospitals for all, the same low-cost housing for all – regardless of whether you are brown, black, yellow, green or any other spectrum of the rainbow. Provided you are loyal, you belong, you intend to make this place tick. I say you are a partner with me in this enterprise. And slowly, over the years, something is going to happen.\"\\nSir, that something did happen.\\nIn 1976, I started studying at Serangoon Gardens Secondary School as a 13-year-old, a stone\\'s throw from the same Serangoon Gardens Circus the speech was made a mere 11 years earlier. I was the middle child of three boys to a pair of Chinese language teachers living in the promised low-cost housing, attending the same school with my Malay, Indian and other Chinese schoolmates from varying socioeconomic backgrounds. Looking back, Sir, it is an absolute privilege to have lived through the earlier years where we worked towards this social compact together as a nation.  \\nSir, to put things in perspective, embarking on this multiracial and multicultural path with an inclusive social compact was a unique one at the time. As Mr Lee Kuan Yew also shared in his speech, the other path, which was arguably an easier and more popular route by other countries of the time, was communalism, where one appeals to one\\'s race, one\\'s language, one\\'s religion, oftentimes that of the majority.\\nBut we were determined, together with our successive leaders, to hold on and continue to build upon the core values of a multiracial, multicultural society that leverages diversity as a strength towards creating a shared sense of belonging and identity. In so doing, we have also allowed different communities to be free to preserve and promote their cultural heritage and to practice customs and beliefs while always being mindful of the rights and sensibilities of others.  \\nSir, we were never a homogenous people speaking a common tongue or practicing a common religion and I believe we never had any aspirations to be one. We were diverse but united in our belief that we are here to build a nation that every single one of us, regardless of race, language or religion, had a stake in.  \\nBeing unique took many years of hard work and consistency in nation-building and I will be the first to say that while we have come a long way, we are far from the finished article. In fact, this is likely to be a continuing work in progress for as long as we believe that this is the social compact we want for Singapore.\\nThere are some who point to instances which suggest the polarisation of Singapore\\'s society along socioeconomic status, race and nationality. There have also been vocal discussions on many social issues involving these topics. These topics that relate closely to our social compact.  I had also raised these issues at the Committee of Supply Debates for MCCY in the last two years. \\nSir, I think, however, that such discourse can be useful if discussed in a constructive and respectful manner. It can also prompt a deeper reflection about our values and what it means to be Singaporean.  \\nFrom another perspective, if we were instead a nation of one race, one language and one religion, then such discussions would surely end in a tragic outcome, as shown elsewhere around the world.    \\nBeing able to constructively discuss such sensitive matters freely speaks volumes on how far we have come since Independence. We exhibit concern over these matters because they are vitally important to us. We take collective action because it goes to the very core values of the social compact that we have so painstakingly built over the years.  \\nIt is therefore with much anticipation that I look forward to our Government\\'s efforts and agenda in refreshing our social compact.\\nMr Speaker, Sir, I would like to add that I listened to the speeches by the hon Members of the WP, Mr Leon Perera and Mr Faisal Manap. They made some comments about the People\\'s Association (PA) that I disagree with completely. Mr Leon Perera and Mr Faisal Manap are quite wrong. \\nThe People\\'s Association (PA) and its members are here to serve fellow Singaporeans and not to advance the interest of any political party. In fact, there are very strict rules on PA\\'s activities, its roles and its objectives.\\nMr Leon Perera and Mr Faisal Manap\\'s statements do not do justice to the contributions of many thousands of grassroots leaders, staff and volunteers in our PA community. These people come forward to serve the community and fellow residents and build a better Singapore.\\nMr Faisal Manap had also made comments about wanting to have the resources of a PA network and to be able to do things like give out Edusave awards.\\nHe only asked to be involved in some small selected part of the work of the grassroots advisor. He is not going to do the equally important work of explaining difficult Government policies. He is not going to go out into the community and explain the need for GST to be increased or for public transport fares to be adjusted or for any number of popular but vital and important policies where as community leaders, we have to convince residents that the long-term interests of Singapore are best served by taking these steps.\\nHe has asked to only do the nice things – hand out awards, take photographs, congratulate families. \\nYes, these are nice things. Events to celebrate. As a grassroots advisor, I am glad to be able to be with the families and share their joy and pride. But these are the results of Government programmes and Government policies.\\nIf Mr Faisal Manap is going to be honest about this issue, he needs to admit that he cannot fulfil the role of grassroots advisor on behalf of the Government when he disagrees with so many of the Government\\'s policies and with how the Government raises money to fund its progress.\\nMr Speaker, Sir, PA does important work for the good of Singapore and Singaporeans. It also handles the difficult work of engaging the public on the hard truths involved in making our society harmonious, peaceful and sustainable. I thank the hardworking staff and volunteers for all that they do for all of us. [Applause.]\\nMr Speaker: Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat.\\n2.24 pm\\nThe Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Heng Swee Keat): Mr Speaker, Sir, over the past few days, we have heard diverse views on how we can take Singapore forward in a more uncertain and contested world.\\nThe Prime Minister spoke about the grave geopolitical and economic outlook and how we must stay united, be go-getting and uphold our good standing in the world. Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence laid out five key shifts to create a stronger social compact to take Singapore forward. Members have offered perspectives and suggestions across a range of issues and concerns.\\nI will not attempt to sum up, which will not do justice to the range and quality of ideas that have been raised in this House but allow me to commend Members on two counts – first, for identifying difficult issues early, putting forward ideas and solutions to address them and highlighting the trade-offs. Second, that even in proposing changes, many Members abide by certain fundamentals precious to Singapore, such as fairness, multiracialism and our approach of tripartism. \\nThis is what Forward Singapore is about – building on strong foundations and at the same time, having the courage to do things differently from before if needed. \\nIt is befitting that this Debate is taking place in the year that we commemorate the 100th birth anniversary of Mr Lee Kuan Yew. \\nSome thirty years ago, I was at a meeting where Mr Lee asked a successful American venture capitalist why he had asked Mr Lee to meet with him. \\nThe American replied that Mr Lee was the \"ultimate entrepreneur\". While he, the venture capitalist, helped build successful companies, Mr Lee built a new nation – two remarkable lifelong learners learning from each other.\\nIndeed, the newly independent Singapore was akin to a startup – figuring out our economic strategy, attracting companies to invest, building up our workers\\' capabilities while ensuring national cohesion and security. \\nMr Lee did not do it alone. He had a team of capable comrades like Dr Goh Keng Swee, Mr Rajaratnam, Encik Othman Wok and many more. Together, they laid a strong foundation for Singapore to take off. The best way for us to remember Mr Lee and our founding fathers is to learn from and build on this. \\nIndeed, this is what Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence and the 4G team are doing – to refresh our social compact and bring Singapore forward. \\nLike Mr Lee and the founding fathers, the 4G team must win the trust of Singaporeans by setting out a clear plan to secure a better future for all. Our plans must address Singaporeans\\' aspirations and concerns, given today\\'s context of an ageing population, greater economic disruption, a worrisome international environment and differences in starting points. \\nThis is why the Forward Singapore agenda sets out the shifts we need to make to refresh our social compact. \\nThis unity and clear sense of purpose is crucial if we are to continue to secure our place in the world. \\nAs President said in her address, we must \"take the world as it is, and not what we wish it to be\". \\nOver the years, our policies and hard work have earned Singapore and Singaporeans a good reputation. The next lap will see new challenges as geopolitics become more unsettling, technology and innovation disrupt jobs more rapidly and our constraints of land, labour and carbon become tighter, but I am optimistic that we can once again turn challenges into opportunities and secure a bright future for Singapore and Singaporeans. \\nWithin our short history, we have managed to survive and thrive through even more difficult circumstances. A key lesson is that to continue to succeed, we must stay relevant and useful to the world while deepening our social cohesion and national unity. \\nAs we look forward towards the future, allow me to touch on three things we need to get right, in addition to the many that many of you have suggested. \\nFirst, we must grow a vibrant and innovative economy. \\nSecond, we must develop every Singaporean to their fullest potential and empower each one to thrive and succeed.\\nThird, we must remain open as an economy, as a society and as a people. \\nLet me start with growing the economy.\\nSome may ask whether we should move beyond economic growth to focus on other pressing domestic issues such as caring for our seniors and uplifting those with disadvantages. After all, we are almost at full employment and the constant call to upgrade and reskill can be tiresome. \\nThis is a false choice.\\nThroughout our history, growth has never been for growth\\'s sake. Growth is critical for giving us the means to build a better Singapore and better lives for Singaporeans. Growth allows our people to access good jobs, fulfil their aspirations and raise their families. It generates the resources for our nation to fund needs and priorities, such as supporting families, caring for our seniors and uplifting those with disadvantages. Thinking longer term, growth coupled with prudence has enabled us to build a buffer to weather many storms.\\nOur national reserves were created through the surpluses generated by strong economic growth. Our founding fathers and successive governments were disciplined about saving for a rainy day.\\nWithin my career, I have experienced many of such rainy days – the Asian Financial Crisis, the dot.com bubble, the Global Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, which plunged us into one of the worst recessions. We supported our workers and companies through these crises and retained their capabilities. This enabled Singapore to bounce back quickly.  \\nDuring the COVID-19 crisis, we rolled out five Budgets in one year and eventually drew down around $40 billion from past reserves to save lives and livelihoods. Most remarkably, we did not borrow a single cent, which would have burdened future generations. I am grateful, as a citizen, that we could do this. Without strong growth and the discipline of setting aside resources to provide a buffer against the unexpected, Singapore and Singaporeans would have been worse off.\\nSo, let us resolve to not just think about the next election, but to think long-term, about the future of Singapore and Singaporeans. We must do our best to build up the capability and resources for future generations of Singaporeans, just as the previous generations had done for us.\\nThis is why we should think carefully when the WP says that they reject the GST hike because one alternative that they have been constantly offering is to increase the proportion used from returns on investments. This will slow down the rate of accumulating reserves, leaving future generations with less resources.\\nSustaining growth and creating good jobs for our people will become harder in the years ahead. Besides getting our fiscal and monetary policies right, we must address structural changes that are sweeping across the world. Let me mention just three. \\nFirst, scientific and technological innovation will reshape every sector of the economy even more rapidly than before. Industry 4.0 is reshaping jobs and skills. Today, robots can enable factories to operate round-the-clock. In fact, I myself have seen several dark factories, where it is not even lighted up, because the robots were all doing the job and they did not need lights. And an AI can spot disease on x-rays as accurately as a human radiologist. Ms Mariam Jaafar spoke about the impact of AI earlier.\\nNew sectors like the digital economy and renewables, biotech and a whole range of others are advancing rapidly. There is now a more dynamic corporate landscape of startups and smaller companies, pushing the frontiers with greater agility. Many traditional firms and workers will find this competition unsettling. Competition not just from other countries or from foreigners, but from greater automation and AI. Yet these advances also offer the best hope for addressing global challenges like climate change and ageing populations, from extending healthy longevity, to new low-carbon technology that can bring us closer towards a net-zero world. We must learn to harness the best of science, technology and innovation, while supporting our workers and companies to ride these advances and blunting the sharp edges that they bring. \\nSecond, as countries realise the critical importance of technology, technological supply chains will increasingly bifurcate and fragment into competing blocs. The shift towards national security considerations and industrial policy will reverse the past three decades of globalisation and free trade. These will reduce efficiency and innovation. \\nWhat does this mean for Singapore? Singapore\\'s small open economy, which has benefited from an open, multi-lateral framework, can be badly affected. We must stay nimble and adapt quickly. \\nThird, ageing populations, especially in the developed world, will be a challenge for many governments. Ageing can significantly affect personal consumption, retirement adequacy, healthcare consumption and economic dynamism. In many countries, the social compact is being strained as societies confront this crisis. \\nSingapore is facing similar challenges, and we will have to make difficult policy moves like raising taxes to support growing social needs. More fundamentally, we need to grapple with the difficult but critical issue of talent and immigration, which I will speak more about later. \\nThese three structural changes will transform the global economy. To succeed, we must press on with efforts to transform our economy, with the Government, businesses and workers working closely together. \\nWe had made a good start seven years ago. The Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) mobilise companies and workers in every sector to prepare for the future. We are now into our second iteration. ITM 2.0 includes two additional pillars – resilience and sustainability. Resilience to address shocks in the supply chains and sustainability to address carbon constraints.\\nThere is also a sharper focus on the future of jobs and skills, to better deploy technology, and prepare for an ageing workforce. I visited two companies which leveraged technology to redesign higher-value and better jobs for their older workers. One automated their entire processes. The founder explained to me that he trained a staff in his 60s to supervise the new automated system. I should tell Mr Leong Mun Wai that the founder was a foreigner who has been working here for many years and the older worker was a Singaporean whom he cared about and said, \"I\\'d better redesign the process\" to keep him employed. \\nThis staff was very qualified to do this because he had gone through the difficult manual work before and if there was any breakdown in the system, he would happen to be the best person to be able to do that. He was thoughtful enough and caring enough to redesign the whole job and train him to do it.\\nAnother company adopted the use of exoskeletons to enable their staff to lift objects safely. \\nThe broader point is that job redesign can be empowering and inclusive, a point that Miss Rachel Ong mentioned yesterday about helping persons with disabilities. Besides enabling older workers who wish to continue working to do so in a fulfilling and safe manner, it can enable differently-abled people to take on good jobs and fulfil their potential. \\nWith science and technology determining the next bound of growth and competitiveness, we must deepen Singapore\\'s investments in R&D, and tighten the linkage between our R&D and industry transformation efforts. In a more contested world, we should position Singapore as a Global Asia node of technology, innovation and enterprise. This way, we can attract, create and capture value in Singapore, which will benefit not just ourselves, but the region and the world. \\nOver the years, we have invested in and grown our research, innovation and enterprise (RIE) capabilities. We have strengthened our research capabilities in our universities. The National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) are now ranked among the best in the world. \\nBesides anchoring multi-national enterprises, we have also developed a lively startup ecosystem, connecting venture capital and private equity with innovative startups and companies. Our efforts have yielded good outcomes. Singapore is ranked among the top ten most innovative economies in the world.\\nIn an age of contestation, we must build bridges, not walls. Positioning Singapore as a Global Asia node is of strategic importance. We seek to be a trusted partner with strong regulatory frameworks and rules, and connected to different parts of the world. We can be the place that facilitates collaboration between like-minded partners and countries.\\nWe must continue to welcome the best researchers and scientists and entrepreneurs from around the world. As several Nobel laureates who were in Singapore for the Global Young Scientists Summit earlier this year told their audience, \"Science is Global. By building bridges, we can stay relevant and useful to the world\". So, I was glad to hear Mr Pritam Singh say earlier on that the WP is not xenophobic. \\nI have spoken about growing our economy. Let me now move on to the next point. \\nUltimately, economic growth is about creating tangible benefits for all. To do this, we must develop every Singaporean fully and enable each to maximise his or her potential and seize opportunities.\\nThe World Bank ranks Singapore as the best place in the world for a child to realise his or her potential. It reflects our investments and shifts particularly in education, to support different pathways, skills and inclinations. And we plan to further widen the notion of meritocracy, as Minister Chan Chun Sing said earlier.\\nThrough our education system, we prepare our young people to navigate shifts and seize opportunities with confidence. One aspect is nurturing \"Asia-capable\" students who can operate and build connections in the region, which is a vast and growing market. Bilingualism and the experience of growing up in a multiracial society bring advantages.\\nWe nurture competencies like global awareness, cross-cultural literacy, communication and collaboration skills. And we provide opportunities for overseas exposure throughout the schooling journey, from internships to immersion programmes. These enable us to shape an outward orientation and acceptance of diversity from young. \\nWe also prepare our young people to harness and complement technology, by building skills that machines and AI cannot yet deliver well. For example, creativity, empathy and building connections are areas where human endeavour remains superior, at least for now. This is why we focus on building socio-emotional competencies, and enable our students to put scientific principles into practice through the Applied Learning Programme. \\nCoupled with scholarships and study awards that span industries and sectors, our young people receive a continuum of support to build relevant competencies, pursue their passions and join the workforce with confidence. \\nBut developing our people must go beyond the schooling years. Success in a more disruptive world requires continuous reskilling throughout life. We must, as Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence said, strive to be a \"Learning Society – from cradle to grave\". \\nWe will strengthen our SkillsFuture movement to ensure Singaporeans are resilient and well-equipped to face the future. This goes hand-in-hand with jobs transformation and business transformations that we mentioned earlier. It also complements ongoing efforts at the industry level to develop Singaporeans, including ongoing efforts by the Singapore Business Federation. And there is scope to partner companies to develop Singaporeans for regional and global leadership roles.\\nWhat does success look like when we put the efforts to develop our economy and our people together? Let me cite two concrete examples.  \\nIn our universities and research institutes, we have top academics and scientists working alongside Singaporeans who studied in the best universities in the world. This builds a strong ecosystem that attracts collaboration with the best researchers and universities. Our students benefit because they get to learn from top professors, interact with peers from all over the world, and strengthen their cross-cultural skills. \\nOverseas, we are seeing enterprising Singaporeans and Singapore companies chasing opportunities and building new partnerships. When I visited Ho Chi Minh City last year, I met a startup formed by a young Singaporean and his Vietnamese friend. They had studied together in Singapore, and the both of them gamely ventured forth, the Singaporean staying in Singapore to run the business operations, and the Vietnamese in Vietnam, running the IT operations. \\nThese two examples illustrate the final point I would like to raise, that is, for Singapore to continue thriving, Government-led efforts to deepen collaboration, be it in free trade, investments, or research, is not enough. To reap the full benefit of these collaborations, Singapore and Singaporeans must remain not just open and connected, but relevant and useful. \\nRemaining open in this era of contestation enables Singapore to capture new value and flows, and strengthen our capabilities. An open mindset and eagerness to venture beyond our shores enables Singaporeans to capture opportunities in the region and beyond. We must continually think about how Singapore and Singaporeans can be relevant and useful, and what special role we can play. Our value proposition is building connections across cultures and economies, and we must strengthen this.\\nOpenness is not new to Singapore. It is, in fact, core to our identity and values. Our plural, multiracial society reflects this open-mindedness. We chose to organise ourselves to ensure opportunities for all, regardless of race, language or religion. Just a few minutes earlier, we heard from Mr Sitoh Yih Pin a very moving account of his personal experience as a young student. \\nIt is an extraordinary principle, as the eminent historian Prof Wang Gungwu pointed out. Singapore, Prof Wang said, is the only nation that he knows of where the majority accepted that they had to treat everyone as equal and that a plural society was the foundation of her nationhood. \\nThis open-mindedness, coupled with our stable environment and strong governance, no doubt has resonance in today\\'s more fractured and fractious world.\\nI am happy to see many of our people, especially our youths, venturing abroad. Our Global Innovation Alliance (GIA) – a network of 17 innovation hotspots around the world – has enabled our entrepreneurs to incubate their ideas and find partners overseas. Many local companies are also internationalising and finding success overseas. \\nOur companies tap on their diverse workforce to navigate foreign markets. This spirit of adventure and entrepreneurship in our people is commendable. The value of being a Singaporean will rise if we remain dynamic, outward-looking and effective in building connections with people around the world. We must continue to encourage Singaporeans to venture out and to integrate the foreigners who are studying and working here, so that we can draw energy and capabilities from diverse sources.\\nLet me repeat that. The value of being a Singaporean will rise, if we remain dynamic, outward-looking and effective in building connections with people around the world. We must continue to encourage Singaporeans to venture out and to integrate the foreigners who are studying and working here, so that we can draw energy and capabilities from diverse sources.\\nAt the same time, we must recognise that when the old encounters the new, this could spark off both opportunities and friction. While we pursue opportunities, we must also address frictions.\\nGrowing up in Singapore with fellow Singaporeans, we have developed a certain set of norms and behaviours. New citizens, Permanent Residents and work pass holders will likewise bring different sets of norms and behaviours. It may be uncomfortable experiencing these differences when we encounter newcomers. We may also be concerned about wealth inequality, more severe competition for jobs, or even unfair workplace practices. These are issues that the Government is addressing, by adjusting our policies, strengthening our frameworks and developing Singaporeans fully.\\nOur commitment to openness remains unchanged, but we, too, can refine our approach to openness to ensure that it is fit for the times. Mr S Rajaratnam, in the early days of nationhood, said that \"being a Singaporean is not a matter of ancestry, it is a conviction and choice\".\\nConviction and values remain fundamental when we consider newcomers who seek to be a part of Singapore. If there are those who share in our convictions and values, let us encourage them to contribute and invite them to grow Singapore together. Many already are, and we will further nurture the philanthropy ecosystem. At the same time, having developed a set of norms and behaviours that is precious to us, we should set out these expectations and exhort newcomers seeking to sink roots in Singapore to adapt to these norms and behaviours. \\nOn the part of Singaporeans born and raised here, we must have the patience and empathy to help newcomers settle in and integrate better. This is how we can remain open yet cohesive as a society; open-minded yet proud of our Singapore identity; and successful as a nation and a people. Mr Speaker, Sir, let me say a few words in Mandarin.  \\n(In Mandarin): [Please refer to Vernacular Speech.] Since our nation\\'s independence, openness and diversity have been critical to Singapore\\'s success. Today, Singapore\\'s ability to stand firm in a volatile world depends on how open-minded we are. \\nTo create a bigger stage for Singapore, first, we need to fully develop local talents. At the same time, we must continue to attract the best companies and the best talents.\\nForeign talents and the local labour workforce complement each other. When we attract high quality companies to set up shop here, we can create more jobs for Singaporeans. But foreigners could also compete with local workers. When local workers could not secure job offers or lose out on promotions, they might feel unfairly treated. On the other hand, when some foreign workers and their family members do not fully assimilate into our society, or do not adapt to our social norms, this could result in conflicts with Singaporeans.\\nI understand that Singaporeans are worried and concerned about these issues. The Government has fine-tuned its policies. We have stipulated specific requirements to address the quality of foreign talents and to prevent concentration in certain sectors. The Government is also doing more to develop and train Singaporeans to enhance their competitiveness.\\nAt the same time, I would like to encourage foreign talents and new immigrants. As long as you are determined to make Singapore your home, put in effort to assimilate and contribute to our Singapore society and build a sense of belonging, you will be one of us.\\nOnly then, can the Singapore society remain cohesive and our people united, with everyone working together for the prosperity and progress of our nation. An open and diverse Singapore society allows us to connect with the rest of the world. This is unique to Singapore. Only when our society remains open and diverse, can Singapore continue to embody our values and shine internationally.\\n(In English): Let me conclude in English. Mr Speaker, Sir, as we debated the Motion of thanks these past few days, I am struck by the President\\'s reminder to this House of our responsibility to steward Singapore for the next generations, just as previous generations have done for us. \\nI started this speech with a story of a venture capitalist calling Mr Lee Kuan Yew the \"ultimate entrepreneur\", for building a nation out of a colonial outpost. Since our Independence, we have navigated major changes well and innovated in many areas.\\nIn the coming years, securing our future will require us to continue transforming our economy and creating new opportunities for our people. We must continue to have this spirit of pushing our frontiers, to harness technology and innovation to improve the lives of Singaporeans. \\nWe must take care of the most vulnerable segments of our society, while ensuring that our broad middle continue to see improvements in their lives. \\nMost importantly, we must continue to build on the foundation of our national pledge – \"regardless of race, language or religion\" – to stay united in this contested world while deepening connections with people around the world. This way, Singapore and Singaporeans will stay relevant and useful to the world, and stay united and successful. Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion. [Applause.]\\nMr Speaker: Order. I propose to take a break now. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at 3.10 pm.\\n Sitting accordingly suspended\\n at 2.55 pm until 3.10 pm.\\nSitting resumed at 3.10 pm.\\n[Mr Speaker in the Chair]\\n DEBATE ON PRESIDENT\\'S ADDRESS\\nDebate resumed.\\nMr Speaker: Minister Edwin Tong.\\n3.10 pm\\nThe Minister for Culture, Community and Youth and Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have had several requests over the break to cut down on the speech. I am also mindful of colleagues who are celebrating Hari Raya and I want to wish them in advance Selamat Hari Raya. [Applause.]\\nSir, over the course of this week\\'s debate, we have talked about the many challenges that we see ahead of us, the shifts that we need to make in an increasingly difficult and changing environment – to face a harsher, more uncertain economic climate; to guard against growing inequality. \\nMembers have spoken about how we can strengthen our policies and our socio-economic infrastructure, in areas like education, employment and housing.  \\nSir, we have heard good many ideas and have had a lively, robust cut and thrust debate and I believe all these steps that we have heard in this House, they are all important, in and of themselves, as key success factors for Singapore. \\nBut equally critical and urgent is for us to be able to achieve all of this together, working in unity. All of us, a people of different backgrounds and persuasions, a diversity of cultures, faiths and languages coming together to build consensus, create space and forge a compact that can see us thrive and which can also help us withstand the growing external threats on the horizon. \\nOne shining example of how unity and cohesion has served us well was in how we tackled COVID-19 together, as a nation. \\nPrime Minister spoke about this, on Wednesday.  \\nOur nation\\'s collective sacrifices and efforts, with a high trust quotient for Government and institutions, saw us through COVID-19 and we came out stronger and more united after COVID than we were before. \\nIn a 2022 survey by the Pew Research Centre on how advanced economies were affected by COVID-19, Singapore was found to be less divided, and more united, after coming out of COVID-19. In fact, Singapore was ranked highest by quite a distance. \\nThis has in turn led to other positive outcomes, with our unity being a key driver behind the confidence we have in our healthcare system, as well as in our economic outlook and recovery.  \\nWorking together, caring for one another, having trust in our institutions – these qualities have seen us through the crisis of a generation. Compared to many other countries, some of which were deeply divided to begin with – they came out even more fractured after the experience. It is therefore vital for us that we continue to grow the reservoir of social capital that we have worked so hard on, over the years, to accumulate. \\n As various Members have noted in this House, we have long recognised the need for our country to be special, to forge a unique path as a multi-racial and multi-religious society, to be one that celebrates our ethnic diversity as strength, while having a shared sense of belonging and identity. Few societies around the world have succeeded in ensuring its citizens live harmoniously together, let alone one with as much diversity as Singapore. \\nI have no doubt that even as we have done well, and we have; our unity, our ability to stand together, will continuously be tested.\\nWe were an unlikely nation to begin with, and perhaps, we still are. We must never lose sight of our roots. In 1965, we were forced out on our own. At that time, we had a diverse population with a Chinese majority. We were surrounded by much larger Muslim majority countries around us. And as Mr Sitoh Yih Pin so emotionally and eloquently shared earlier, those were the founding circumstances of our country.\\nAnd almost counter intuitively, our founding leaders chose the path of most resistance. We chose to go against the grain and embraced multiculturalism and diverse ethnicities, to recognise and to uplift everyone to make our country a Singapore for all – not just for Chinese, Indians or Malays – and having a space for all religions. It was this bold step, born out of extremely difficult circumstances which became the original seed that has allowed our unique multicultural society to grow, to become more cohesive over the years and to flourish.\\nWe will continue to draw strength from that unity. It makes us stronger and it certainly gives us a basis to move forward, and we are stronger than the sum of our parts for that unity.\\nI would add that we did not just proclaim that we want to be a multicultural, multiracial society. We worked hard at it, we worked hard to make this happen, through our policies and through our institutions.\\nOur founding leaders, for instance, set out in our Constitution, the most basic document that we have in Singapore, for the government of the day to always have regard for the interests of our racial and religious minorities. We set up the Presidential Council on Minority Rights (PCMR). In almost no other place in the world is there an institution like the PCMR whose role is to scrutinise legislation after they are passed in this House to ensure that they are not disadvantageous to any particular racial or religious community.\\nWe have laws like the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act, which set out clear parameters to deter hate speech and other derogative comments on religious communities. And we do so because we want to ensure that every minority, whether in race or religion, will have the space and freedom to practise their religion and culture as much as possible.\\nOur electoral system guarantees minority representation in Parliament. And by doing so, no political party can prevail by narrowly appealing to only one racial or religious segment of society.\\nOur Ethnic Integration Policy allows us to have a balanced ethnic mix in our public housing so that we do not have racial enclaves like we see in many other countries. This is a policy that has ensured that for all of us, in our lived experience, day-to-day, where we go, where we live, where we do our super-marketing, we will come across a diverse range of different ethnicities at our doorstep in our daily lives. It helps us foster a strong relationship between our people and it shapes who we are and how we approach ethnicity, diversity in Singapore.\\nYet, even while we have made our diversity a pillar of strength, the uniqueness of Singapore, we must recognise that if we are not careful, it can very quickly become a point of vulnerability.  \\nWhen a society is as diverse as we are, harmony is not the natural order of things. And it is something that we must constantly work on, to jealously guard it and to be always fearful that it is taken away from us. \\nAround the world today, we see societies becoming more pluralistic; and as they do so, they also become more fractured. The most recent edition of the Edelman Trust Barometer shows that trust continues to decrease in many countries around the world. Not just trust in government, but in all institutions – businesses, the media and even in non-governmental organisations (NGOs). As various Members in this House have said, it is exceptional that Singapore has so far bucked that trend. This global trend of falling trust levels leads to deeper apprehension and suspicion. The shared common space is reduced and divisive ideologies take hold.  \\n These are not just foreign concepts or phenomena; these are developments that affect us in Singapore here as well. The increasing inter-connectedness of the virtual world means that many concerns that were once distant and foreign to us, now have the same immediacy and resonance as much as local ones. As Mr Seah Kian Peng has pointed out, it opens the door to foreign influences seeking to create divisions in our society, to target and to accentuate existing fault lines, or perhaps even create new ones by churning out increasing amounts of emotional, emotive, provocative media, with little or no basis in truth and we must assume that these foreign influences exist here, right here, on our shores.\\nSo, we cannot be complacent and take our cherished unity for granted and we cannot for a moment assume that we will be immune to this.\\nThis is why our Forward Singapore exercise is so important. One pillar of this exercise is the \"Unite\" pillar, where we bring Singaporeans together to explore what keeps us going as one people.\\nThis is, of course, not a new agenda – national unity has been one of our foremost priorities for many years. But aspirations change, challenges are different, they have shifted and the context in which we tackle these issues must also change. And so, we must be alive to all these changes, be cognisant of them and work out what would be the new approach in this new compact to tackle these issues. \\nFor instance, how do we create deeper personal, social bonds – particularly in a world that is so digitally connected? How do we nurture what is common between us, while at the same time celebrating our individual diversity? How do we stay united in the face of global headwinds? \\nI have attended several ForwardSG dialogues, met a range of people from different backgrounds, exchanged many views – some of which I will share here. And I must say that overall, I am very encouraged by what I have heard. I have come away with a significantly renewed sense of optimism, that Singaporeans care deeply about that unity, they appreciate how fragile it is and they want to come forward and proactively play a part to contribute to ensure that we do not lose that unity.  \\nOne key takeaway is that this unity is not an abstract concept – unity, cohesion, harmony – sometimes, if you do not pay attention, you might think it is just an abstract concept, but it is not. And we achieve it not by ideas alone, but more importantly by having it embedded in our daily lives: part and parcel of what we do, where we go, who we see and the people we socialise and work with.\\nIt is realised through these shared experiences, the various social and communal interactions that we may have and the spaces that we have to do so. \\n I have been Minister at the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) for almost three years now. I started almost three years ago when we were in the thick of COVID-19 – we could not come together, safe distancing measures meant that we had to keep people apart when our very mission was to bring people together. But over the last half a year to a year or so, I have been fortunate to be, in my capacity, at the intersection of so many different touch points of our community, where people from a broad cross section of society come together to pursue their passions. \\n Whether it is in sports or arts, heritage, culture, language, the youths, the grassroots network, or the various Chinese clans and associations that I meet on a regular basis. \\nAll of them come together at the different intersection points and all these sectors of our community represent tremendous opportunities for us to build our social capital and enhance our sense of cohesion and unity. These are the platforms on which people can engage with one another, day to day, and through such interactions, begin to foster deeper relations and build trust and rapport. We cannot force unity and cohesion. But we can institutionally create the environment for people to come together to inter-mix across different fault lines, across different segments of our society. \\nSo, let me share some thoughts on what MCCY has done and has in mind, to ensure that we continue to foster this deep sense of unity.\\nFirst, Mr Murali Pillai, when he spoke, talked about sports as a tremendous opportunity for us to level the playing field. Dr Tan Wu Meng spoke about togetherness and, indeed, all of these are different ways of expressing that we need to have avenues for us to have social mixing between different segments of our society.\\nKey to fostering stronger unity is to have both occasion and opportunity for people from different backgrounds to see and enjoy spending time with one another, through the passions that they pursue so that we are not stratified and constantly in our own social circles only and in our own echo chambers. Stratification is very unhealthy and it can lead to entrenched inter-generational stratification as well if we are not careful. So, we need to break down these barriers, not just along racial or religious lines but also between other fault lines in our society – like local and foreigner, the different income groups, between the young and old, as well as inter-generational conflict. \\nOn this note, I am very grateful for the good work that has been done by all many ground-up organisations. I have visited many of them, as I am sure many of my colleagues here have – whether it is the social service agencies or voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs), clan associations, self-help groups and so on. Through their own initiative and effort, people are brought together in a variety of ways. For example, within churches, mosques and temples, and other places of worship. These places of worship might serve a specific religious community, but they are completely agnostic when it comes to running programmes with a broader social reach and impact.\\nMany of our religious institutions work together, to benefit their neighbourhoods and in so doing, provide opportunities for their congregation to inter-mix and to get to know each other. For instance, the Al Mawaddah mosque, Sengkang Methodist Church and Arulmigu Velmurugan Gnanamuneeswarar – and I hope I got that right. \\nThe Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for Social Policies (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam): No. [Laughter.]\\nMr Edwin Tong Chun Fai: No. My apologies. And I will have to work on that on my pronunciation.\\nThey work together constantly – and while I may get the names wrong – they all come from different faiths, but they come together to serve underprivileged residents in the vicinity, the neighbourhood in which they operate. Different faiths bound by a common social purpose.\\nI was recently at the Masjid Kampung Siglap for buka puasa, again, as I am sure many of my colleagues here were. What was special about that occasion? The mosque had invited groups from the surrounding temples and churches, and lay people in the estate to come and join them. And when I chatted with them, I found out that many of them had never seen the inside of a mosque, let alone experience buka puasa. It was a special occasion to be able to share that experience together.\\nYoung children who were seeing this for the first time, I am sure, would have been left with a better understanding of the Muslim faith and of the meaning of Muslim practices. And so, the next time they step into a mosque or the next time they engage with a friend who is from the Muslim faith, who is fasting, it no longer feels strange or unknown to them.\\nThis how we foster understanding and build unity, bit by bit, at a very micro-level but coming together, stronger than the sum of our parts, as I said.\\nAnd we want to go beyond just religious tolerance, to a better understanding and appreciation; and grow as a country to embrace differences in our multicultural and multi-religious society. That is after all our aspiration.   \\nTo this end, MCCY has also recently refreshed our Racial and Religious Harmony Circles. At the local level, Harmony Circles provide the structures that foster friendships and build mutual respect in local networks. These circles have served us well over the years to bring different stakeholders in our neighbourhoods coming together. But to reach more and newer sections and, perhaps, younger segments of our community, MCCY will further support their efforts to digitise and expand their programme offerings so that we bring more people in to participate and get to know each other. \\nStarting from this year, we will also be dedicating July as our Racial and Religious Harmony Month – not just a day but a month, to highlight the efforts of our Harmony Circles and our community partners and organise more activities to celebrate and to promote racial and religious harmony, so that the significance of the day and of the occasion and the learning points go beyond just spending a day celebrating one another\\'s special occasions – coming in a different attire, perhaps, or costume, celebrating by exchanging goodies and gifts associated with festivities of other races. Going beyond that, to connect with one another through these traditions and share understanding of these traditions, to deepen an understanding and inculcate the value of openness and appreciation.\\nAnother step that we are exploring is a joint initiative we will have with the Ministry of Education (MOE). Students, as you know, are allocated to their schools based on their academic merit. But there is no reason why this same configuration should also hold for co-curricular activities (CCAs). So, the Strategic Partnership Co-Curricular Activity (SP-CCA) initiative allows secondary students to join in various CCAs outside of their own schools, increasing the variety of the CCAs that students will have access to.\\nBut this initiative has other social benefits. It allows students from different schools, different backgrounds to take part in their chosen CCAs, and helps them to come together outside of school to form friendships. Our students may attend different schools based on the academic curriculum offered, but these non-academic interactions need not be confined by the same terms. So, outside of the subjects they study, they are more enriched when they engage with the wider social network, mix with and form friendships across different schools.\\nSecond, as we build a better home for ourselves, staying united as a country also means being inclusive – having a space for all of us.\\nIn this debate, we have heard a lot about meritocracy and how we will uplift our workers, our families, our children to ensure equal opportunities for all and how, for certain groups, we will have to actively intervene and shape the environment so that there can be better opportunities for all.\\nAt MCCY, there are also several ideas we are pursuing. My colleague, Senior Parliamentary Secretary Eric Chua, spoke on Wednesday about enhancing the landscape for persons with disabilities to alleviate the impediments that they face so they can come along together with us. And beyond that, how we should open up opportunities for persons who are differently abled and differently-interested to fulfil their passions and their potential.\\nFor persons with disabilities, one area we would like to spend a bit more time on is in sport. To spur greater sport participation among persons with disabilities, we have updated the Disability Sport Master Plan (DSMP) for this reason. \\nIndeed, as I am sure many Members who have had experience in this sector will attest to, sport can be a transformative tool, especially for persons with disabilities. It allows them to acquire vital social and communication skills, develop confidence about themselves and feel no inferiority complex. \\nThrough sport, persons with disabilities are also able to reduce the social stigma associated with their disability and are empowered to realise their potential.\\nLaunched in 2016, the DSMP has contributed to increased sport participation rates among persons with disability, rising from 28% in 2015 to 50% in 2019. Our target is 70% by 2030.\\nWe will develop pathways for aspiring para-athletes so that there are equal opportunities for talented Singaporeans, with ability or disability, to compete at the highest levels. This includes growing the pool of coaches and better coaching individuals with disabilities by developing their own professional and technical expertise in disability sports.\\nWe have also introduced a range of programmes, including learn-to-play programmes and the annual Play Inclusive campaign.\\nThe Play Inclusive campaign is where students from both the Special Education and mainstream schools come together. They train together and they compete together in unified sport competitions, for example, in goalball. By playing together on the same team, they bond with each other because they understand each other far better.\\nOur students who participate in these programmes say that these programmes help to normalise what can otherwise be sometimes an awkward situation. It reduces the curious stares and the moments of being overly polite when someone does not quite appreciate the circumstances that they are in. It also allows them to interact in a positive context and challenge assumptions about what they can or cannot do.\\nAn inclusive society is also one where diverse skills and talents can be better appreciated and valued and those with these talents have opportunities to develop and to advance.\\nWe have done much to open pathways in the arts. The School of the Arts (SOTA), for example, has made it possible to have high quality specialised arts education from the age of 13 and the University of the Arts now allows us to culminate with a degree in the arts in Singapore.\\nWe have invested in this to provide a comprehensive arts education so that for those who see this as their strength and as their passion, there will be rich opportunities.\\nWe will continue to invest in building up our creative industry to grow a flourishing and globally connected creative economy for the arts through new business models, development pathways and internationalisation opportunities.\\nWe are unlocking these new opportunities with the next iteration of Our SG Arts Plan and Our SG Heritage Plan so that we do not just stop at providing added qualifications but also create an entire cultural ecosystem and value chain for those interested to embark on a career and fulfil their aspirations and their potential. I think this is central to our notion of unity.\\nWe have also stepped up our support for those who excel in sports by providing pathways through the High Performance Sports system and enabling our TeamSG athletes to perform at their very best.\\nA key part of this ecosystem and this plan is the Sport Excellence Scholarship (spexScholarship) which is offered to our athletes with the potential to excel at major games or world-level events.\\nTake Shanti Pereira, for instance, our national sprinter. Many of you, I am sure, would have been very proud to have seen her break her records, making great strides recently, quite literally.\\nShanti returned last November to the spexScholarship. She spent some time away from the spexScholarship, but after a while, having discussed with her coach and the National Sports Association (NSA), decided to come back full-time and was supported by the spexScholarship, which grants her an allowance and benefits, and allows her to access support to sport science and sport medicine. She now trains full-time and competes overseas, all supported by the spexScholarship. Her decision, as you know, has paid off well, with her recent performances.\\nWe expanded the support so that athletes with the potential can focus full-time on their sporting pursuits and do us proud in Singapore.\\nBeyond supporting our top athletes, we will also enhance the accessibility of our programmes and facilities so that even more can participate in sports, perhaps not just for fitness but also socially, as a platform for bonding and mixing, as Mr Murali Pillai has suggested.\\nRecently, at Budget 2023, I had announced that we will put in an additional $100 of credits in the ActiveSG accounts of children aged four to 12 so that they can start accessing these programmes, not just for fitness but from a social mixing perspective from an early age.\\nSir, in this House, over the last few days, various Members have highlighted that Singapore\\'s concept of meritocracy could be too narrow. It needs to be refreshed to look beyond academic domains of schools and grades, where diverse skills and talents in non-academic domains such as the sports and arts are also recognised and everyone is given an opportunity to pursue their passion, hone their talents and do their best in their chosen field.\\nWe agree with that. That is why at MCCY, our work is focused on opening these different pathways in arts and sports, for instance, for us to celebrate and include those of different merits.\\nSir, on inclusion, Mr Pritam Singh earlier spoke about the English proficiency test. Let me share my thoughts in this House on the test.\\nSir, I know many people have different views on this and I respect them. I think there is range for a variety of different views on what weight you might place on this. But my own view is that the knowledge of English at a working level, while helpful, should not be a defining or, indeed, a limiting factor, which might happen if you introduce it as a single-point test.\\nAfter all, a significant proportion of Singaporeans throughout our history has not been able to speak English well, many of our parents and grandparents amongst them.\\nMy own grandmother would not pass this test. She is 96 years old today. She probably still would not pass this test today. But she continues to be a source of joy and value to the family in different ways, many of them intangible. \\nIf we had years ago applied this test, then someone like her may not have made it into Singapore. So, we have to think about that as well, as a consideration. That is why I urge this House, as we talk about this and think about this issue, let us not close our hearts to this, but to be open.\\nMr Pritam Singh said the key is in integration. I think that is the point that I have been emphasising. How do we integrate them? Is a single-point English test the best way of doing this? Or perhaps we look more broadly at the process of integration, which I believe is a long-term process.\\nAfter all, our Constitution sets out the criteria. You have got to be in Singapore for a period of time as a resident. Integration requires sustained efforts from all parties. It is a holistic approach.\\nSir, our immigration framework was tightened significantly in 2009 so that a broader range of factors can be considered to assess not just the applicant\\'s ability to contribute but also his or her ability to integrate well into our society and, perhaps also importantly, their commitment to want to sink their roots here.\\nThis includes factors such as the length of stay, which I have mentioned, family ties to Singapore and whether the applicant has studied in a national school or done National Service, for example. I believe these are equally, if not perhaps, in some cases, more effective as a marker of integration.\\nWe currently do not have a single-point English test or proficiency requirement for naturalisation, unlike some other countries.\\nIf you look at Japan, South Korea or the UK, I think they have a language test requirement. It is likely to be because they have a single, more common, more unified operating language.\\nBut that is unlike Singapore, which has four different official languages. Indeed, as Mr Pritam Singh would appreciate, the Constitution itself currently provides that one of the markers for naturalisation is working knowledge of any of the four official languages.\\nSo, I would not say that English proficiency is not important – I think there is value in that – but let us not make it a single qualifying test or single-point assessment for citizenship.\\nSir, let me now turn to our youths. The Forward Singapore exercise is about charting our way forward. Youths are an important part of this journey. To forge a viable compact, we must understand as well as support their dreams and aspirations in a completely different paradigm from when we were growing up. We must also give them a stake in Singapore\\'s future and have a voice.\\nOur young people today must come to terms with a myriad of complex world issues – challenges and constraints such as climate change, economic uncertainty, slowing social mobility and they will be growing up in the context of the ageing population that Minister Ong has spoken about. For all of these, there are no easy or quick solutions.\\nYet, as my colleague Minister of State Alvin Tan and many other Members of this House have articulated, our youths are undaunted. They are not deterred. They have expressed a keen desire, on the contrary, to be a key part of the solution.\\nIn my own engagements with the youth, I have found them to be very much seized with the issues of today. They know that the solutions that they can contribute will make an impact on their lives tomorrow.\\nAfter the President\\'s Address last week, I came across an article in TODAY online. Several youths were interviewed on how they wanted to be involved in nation-building. Some of them made comments and there were reactions which piqued my interest. So, I arranged to meet with a few of them and several other youths to learn and hear for myself first-hand what they were most concerned about, how they saw their role as future leaders and what more we could do to partner with them, to engage them, so that they can be part of that solution.\\nOne point which came up was the desire for a more in-depth discourse. They hoped for more details as to how their feedback and suggestions on policies, which were being considered by the Government, might result in some trade-offs that perhaps they had not thought about.\\nWe agreed that instead of taking an adversarial approach to policy suggestions, we could perhaps engage on these trade-offs and share views on opportunity costs, develop a deeper understanding of these considerations that would be helpful to making policy suggestions.\\nThese were all very constructive suggestions. With this in mind, we will introduce youth panels later this year. Youth panels will be for youths to develop policy recommendations together with the Government, with some differences.\\nThey will be youth-led and will be resourced by agencies like the National Youth Council (NYC) and perhaps the appropriate agency, depending on the domain. They will work on a topic or a policy which resonates with the youths of today – something that is topical, that has traction, interest and a fair number of young people support a discussion on the topic. \\nWe will share our policy considerations and trade-offs, exchange data points and most importantly, think with them on these questions. Against this backdrop, we will create space for our young people to take the lead in the deliberations and formulate suggestions.\\nThrough these panels, we want to engage our youths in meaningful and constructive discourse where they can also listen not just to us in the Government or the agencies, but also to the experience of other people in their position, appreciating that opinions may differ from their own and weighing competing priorities, looking at both the short term as well as having a longer lens perspective of these trade-offs. Together, they will develop policy considerations and present them to the Government.\\nIn turn, these recommendations will be taken seriously. We will make a conscious effort to close the loop with them, whatever the outcomes might be. Those which merit further discussion, we will consider for them to be presented here, in Parliament.\\nMCCY can consider sponsoring a White or Green Paper on the proposal so that they can be considered in this House and we can then all have a robust debate on them. Those involved in giving views or preparing the recommendations can see the impact of the work that they do.\\nWe are formulating this carefully and more details on these youth panels will be provided when ready. Over the next few months, we will consult with youths on the panels and on the key policy issues that they wish to see under the youth panels. We look forward to the active participation of our youths to shape the future of our country.\\nSir, I am confident that our youths will welcome this opportunity. I have always been encouraged by the heart that they have in bringing Singapore forward through my interactions with them.\\nSir, let me now conclude. Earlier this month, President Halimah and I met our Youth Corps leaders at the commencement ceremony of the leaders\\' programme. One of them, Lim Jia Yi, led a project called We+65. Started in 2022, this project reaches out to the less mobile seniors in Sembawang, with activities that helped to improve their mobility as well as their cognitive functions. And it was borne of her realisation that perhaps the seniors were less connected and had less resources available to them.\\nThis was done as part of a volunteering programme with the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) and Blossom Seeds Limited, a charity operating in that area. If you speak to Jia Yi, her sense of responsibility of her commitment to community will shine through clearly. She is passionate about reaching out across generations to befriend seniors, even as she herself is currently a full-time medical student. Busy as she is, she volunteers her time in many other charitable projects and events as well. And while she is young, her leadership was apparent – to bring and convene her fellow youths together to rally them to support her cause.\\nSir, Jia Yi is remarkable, but she is also not an outlier. She is one of the many Singaporeans who continue to step forward, without being asked, to contribute their time and their treasure. And we will continue to work with people like Jia Yi, striving to be those granules of sand which connect us to the bigger blocks of our society, our institutions and collectively make us stronger across generations, racial and religious groups and across the diversity of our population. \\nWhen I meet people like Jia Yi, I am reminded that, in fact, we are already different from so many others in the world, with what we have – diversity and harmony that has resulted from a system that structurally fosters equality, social mixing and integration. This is what the wisdom of an earlier generation of leaders have given to us and has allowed us to build on a strong foundation to chase our dreams and fulfil our ambitions. \\nSo, let us not throw out what has worked well for us over the years. Sometimes, you must look back, to look forward. And these are the elements, the fundamental building blocks that has made it work for Singapore. To continually work at fostering harmony between diverse communities of different races and faiths, creating opportunities for people of all abilities, talents and interests to excel, powered by a culture of inclusion, care and volunteerism.\\nSir, the Semangat yang Baru: Forging a New Singapore Spirit exhibition opened yesterday and I went to visit it. I encourage Members here in this House to visit it. It is at the National Museum and it is free for Singaporeans and PRs. It was an evocative and inspiring exhibition; also, thought-provoking. I left it, feeling a deep sense of pride.\\nIf there is one lesson that I learnt from this exhibition, it is that as a nation, we do not have much. We never had. We do not have natural resources and we do not have the blessings of a natural hinterland that we can take advantage of or indeed, space – which comes at a significant premium for us.\\nBut what we have is our people. We have always had that. We have always done much better, punched above our weight, gone further with our people. And if can continue to stand as one united people, as we declare in our national pledge, then I have no doubt that we will overcome these challenges, with confidence. And we will see a vibrant, thriving Singapore for generations to come. Mr Speaker, I support the Motion. [Applause.]\\nMr Speaker: Mr Pritam Singh.\\n3.48 pm\\nMr Pritam Singh: Thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank you to the Minister for his speech and for referring to the point I made about an English requirement.\\nSir, I have two clarifications. The first is this. I did not say that an English requirement would be a single point of consideration for PRs and new citizenship applications. I think the Minister, in his characterisation, framed it as a sort of litmus test. In fact, I made it clear in my speech today that it was a nudge to align our immigration policy and our bilingual policy.\\nAnd for individuals like foreign spouses who would have some difficulty, especially if English is not a common language that they use; or with respect to Minister\\'s family member who is very old now, for which a test may have been problematic a long time ago – the test is not in that context a veto factor. The existing criteria would apply and it would be a consideration when an immigration decision is considered – that actually this person already has a common lingua franca that many Singaporeans actually share. So, I think the point was a little more nuanced than what the Minister enunciated.\\nI think the second point is international students who are today foreigners; if they want to enter our primary school system, they already have to take a Cambridge English qualification test. So, it is not as if this is really a left-field suggestion or something which is too off the mark.\\nAnd to that end, I refer to the survey in my speech. I think the Minister would have seen it. The Minister referred to various criteria that we broadly know with respect to immigration. But that survey found the ability to communicate in English ranks number one. In fact, the number one position was shared with economic contributions to Singapore.\\nAnd in that context, I think it is a good time to include what MP Murali Pillai spoke about the psyche of the nation and how people\\'s views change through generations and how important this is becoming as a consideration for some Singaporeans.\\nBut I do not want to lean too much into one survey alone. I am sure the Ministry may have a more global perspective of opinion. I am just suggesting that this is something which I felt was important for the Government to consider.\\nMr Edwin Tong Chun Fai: I thank Mr Singh for that clarification. And perhaps, with your clarification it now appears that we are not that far apart, because you did use the phrase \"English test\" when you first raised it. I think it was during COS. And so, when I heard your speech then and earlier today, a test is a test you either pass or you fail. And there must be consequences if you do not pass. So, it was in that context that I said let us not use it as a single point consideration. But I am glad we have clarified that, and you are now saying that is one of several factors that we look at.\\nOn the survey, I understand, and as I said, it is not an unimportant consideration and I accept that. I think we all want to ensure that we can communicate with the people we see in Singapore, at least to a basic degree. And I can see where that is coming from. I can accept the sentiments conveyed in that survey. It is one survey, yes, but it does reflect sentiments in our society and I think we must take heed of it.\\nBut the point about international students, I think, comes from a different perspective. They are taking a qualifying test for a different reason. Because there is an academic element to their entry into the schools in Singapore. So, I do not think one should conflate the two different tests. There are meant for different purposes.\\nMr Speaker: Mr Murali Pillai.\\n3.52 pm\\nMr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok): Mr Speaker, Sir, we have just reached the end of the five-day debate on the Motion of thanks to the President. From my rough count, we heard 67 speeches in this debate. I am happy to note that all hon Members of this House who spoke are united in their support for the Motion.\\nJust a short while ago, before the break, I left this Chamber to visit the loo. There, I bumped into an hon Member, who said to me, that he was really looking forward to seeing me deliver my wrap-up speech. Pleased with his exuberance, I asked whether he was interested to get a sneak preview of what I intended to cover later. He, however, demured. He clarified that what he meant was that once I stand up to speak, it will be a cue for his family who is seeing these proceedings \"live\", that the debate would shortly end. [Laughter.]\\nSo, just like the hon Minister Edwin Tong who spoke before me, I get the drift. Hon Members will be happy to note that I will only make three short points in my speech.\\nFirst, I wish to thank the hon Members who spoke for sharing their valuable insights about the Government\\'s plans outlined by the President. This debate is significant because of the sheer breadth and depth of topics highlighted by hon Members for the Government\\'s consideration. I am not able to exhaustively set out all the topics, but will mention a few of them. \\nThe topics covered included: ensuring that economic growth benefits Singaporeans from all backgrounds, strengthening the tripartite trust, developing our skilled tradesmen, the need to reskill middle-aged workers for them to remain employable and decisively tackle workplace discriminations. All these points persuasively put across by our hon Members from the Labour Movement, such as Minister of State Desmond Tan, Mr Desmond Choo, Ms Yeo Wan Ling, Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman and Mr Patrick Tay.  \\nConcerns about our social compact, the need to strengthen help for have nots in our society – a point that several hon Members, including Mr Seah Kian Peng, Assoc Prof Jamus Lim, Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim and Mr Leong Mun Wai, made. \\n Ensuring better educational outcomes and prospects for children and youths from less privileged backgrounds – this was raised by, amongst others, hon Members Mr Vikram Nair, Dr Wan Rizal, Dr Shahira Abdullah and Mr Henry Kwek.\\n Keeping a keen eye on and addressing the impact of cost of living and inflation on our people – a topic that, again, a number of hon Members spoke on, including Mr Ang Wei Neng and Mr Louis Chua. \\nHighlighting the potenfial threat of Artificial Intelligence on our social trust and togetherness, and at the same time, the need to capture opportunities from this technological advancement – points that were eloquently put across by hon Members Dr Tan Wu Meng and Ms Mariam Jafaar.  \\n Ensuring that trust is a two-way relationship between our people and our Government, the need to promote active citizenry and retention of our core values as a society – points raised by hon Members Ms Tin Pei Ling, Ms He Ting Ru, Mr Leon Perera and Mr Shawn Huang. \\nMoving away from credentialism and valuing skills and competencies instead – something that several hon Members spoke on, including Ms Janet Ang.\\nLooking out for the needs of the differently abled – a topic that hon Members Mr Don Wee and Miss Rachel Ong touched on.  \\nEnsuring that our families remain the building blocks of our society, promoting marriages and parenthood, and at the same time, supporting these families as they become smaller and caregiving responsibilities increase – something that hon Members including Ms Jessica Tan and Mr Gan Thiam Poh spoke on.\\n Providing our rapidly ageing society with a befter support structure, tackling ageism and at the same time, empowering them to contribute to our community – points raised by hon Members Ms Sylvia Lim, Mr Yip Hon Weng, Mr Sakfiandi Supaat, Ms Hany Soh and Mr Edward Chia.  \\nProtecting our aged and vulnerable citizens from scams as we continue to digitalise our economy – a topic raised by amongst others, hon Members Mr Christopher de Souza and Mr Melvin Yong.\\nProviding more support to people with mental health issues – an important topic that was covered by hon Members Ms Ng Ling Ling and Ms Nadia Samdin.\\nOpening up a whole range of pathways to ensure that our meritocratic society is more inclusive – a good number of hon MPs spoke about this, including Mr Xie Yao Quan. \\nConcerns about the environmental issues that our country faces were expressed by several Members including Mr Sharael Taha and Mr Dennis Tan.\\nConcerns about the impact of unbridled asset acquisition in Singapore by increasing numbers of wealthy individuals from overseas who set up family offices – a point made by the hon Leader of Opposition.\\nAnd finally, upholding public confidence in this House and ensuring good politics, strong leadership and good governance at all levels – areas that hon Members Mr Derek Goh, Ms Joan Pereira and Mr Faisal Manap touched on.\\nNotwithstanding the diversity of the topics covered in this debate, I noted unanimity amongst hon Members on the importance of retaining our core values that have been ingrained in our nation by our founding generation of leaders and stood us in good stead for several generations. This is the point that Mr Sitoh Yih Pin emphatically made. He said that our values are and must continue to be hard-coded in our psyche as a people.\\nI agree. This is our secret sauce. This is what will allow us as a nation and society to continue to forge forward to secure a fair share of opportunities for our people to lead fulfilling and dignified lives.\\nMoving on to my second point, I wish to highlight that hon Members had provided a surfeit of suggestions in this debate. These suggestions deserve examination with a view to see if the future plans of this Government that have already been laid out, can be further strengthened by their incorporafion. They include: \\nLinking unemployment support for citizens with their agreement to undertake skills upgrading and active job searching – a suggestion raised jointly by hon Member Mr Desmond Choo. \\nAttaintment of transformative competencies by our children in school – a suggestion of hon Member Mr Darryl David.  \\nFinancial literacy programmes for our children – a suggestion raised by hon Member Mr Gerald Giam.  \\nProtection of whistle-blowers who report on discrimination and unfair employment practices – a suggestion by hon Member Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim.\\nEquipping community volunteers with mental health first aid skills – a suggestion by hon Member Ms Ng Ling Ling. \\nRedesigning of the Progressive Wage Models to provide for more wage rungs to enable workers to climb up more easily up – a suggestion by Mr Raj Joshua Thomas.\\nTo evolve our charity policies so as to support emerging forms of giving by potential grant-makers – a suggestion by Ms Foo Mee Har.\\nTapping on our seniors to get them to volunteer and share their skills and experience with others – an idea raised by hon Member Mr Yip Hon Weng.  \\nLegislating the right to work from home – an idea of hon Member Mr Louis Ng. \\nProviding for caregiving leave to take care of elderly parents – an idea of hon Member Ms Poh Li San; and  \\nEncouraging our non-SMEs to embracing inclusive hiring and employ more persons with disabilities – an idea floated and passionately argued by the hon Member Miss Rachel Ong \\nSeveral hon Members from across the aisle lamented that their suggestions have not been taken up by the Government. I appreciate that they feel strongly about their ideas and are convinced it is for the larger good of our country. I wish to point out that there are also numerous cases of suggestions made passionately by PAP backbenchers which also have not been taken up by the Government. So, they are in good company!\\nI think we can all appreciate that, in assessing the viability of implementing ideas from hon Members, the Executive arm of our Government bears the heavy responsibility of governing. They have to strike a balance between a wide range of factors including policy intent, competing viewpoints and resourcing priorities.\\nIn addition, for some of the ideas to be implemented, there is a need for progress to be made over time – a point that was eloquently put across by hon Member Ms Denise Phua who advocated the integrated 10-year education programme from Primary 1 to Secondary 4, almost 10 years ago.\\nHence, I would not read too much into the Government\\'s decision not to adopt all the suggestions made by hon Members. In fact, if anything, it would be surprising if all the ideas have been accepted without exception.\\nThe Government has unequivocally stated on many occasions that it is agnostic as to who and where good ideas come from. As the hon Leader of the Opposition stated in his speech just now, over the years, the Government did implement several policies that have been brought up by the WP. But of course, the Government, being accountable to this House, has a duty to set its position clearly on suggestions made in this House and articulate its reasons should it not take up the suggestions.\\nThis is Parliamentary democracy at work. This is what our people expect.\\nIn the same vein, for the purposes of establishing common ground which the President has identified in her address to be an important aspect of our work in this House, it would be good for hon Members from Opposition parties to also entrench the policy of acknowledging, where appropriate, where they feel to be good ideas emanating from the Government. This approach entrenches the shared goal of advancing the larger public interest even as we acknowledge that the political process naturally involves a level of contestation.\\nA great example of this happened just a few hours ago, when hon Member Mr Dennis Tan congratulated MOT and MPA for launching an electronic harbour launch recently, thereby reducing carbon dioxide emissions.\\nSir, I now turn my third and final point. From the debate, it is noteworthy that there is broad agreement to the Government\\'s plans as articulated by the President to secure our nation\\'s future. In my opening speech, I drew attention to the ambitious nature of these plans. They involve high levels of creativity. I spent some time highlighting the broad spectrum of plans affecting everything, from defence to the economy to the environment, as well as the fact that a long-term view has to be taken to implement these plans. \\nI therefore congratulate the Government for presenting these plans that have secured this broad agreement in this House.\\nThis, however, is merely the start. To an extent, this may be the easier part of the process. Collectively, we need to secure the all-important buy-in of fellow Singaporeans to make the plans work for the benefit of Singapore and Singaporeans. Whilst this is not an easy task, there is every reason to be confident, in my personal view.\\nThis is where what the President stated in her address about moving forward with confidence becomes relevant. She said: \"We are now in a much stronger position – better poised to overcome our vulnerabilities and armed with crucial resources to push forward with confidence, however stormy the weather. Our collective experiences have strengthened the mutual trust between Singaporeans and their confidence in our system of Government. This virtuous circle relies on us partnering one another and working together to make the impossible, possible.\"\\nI therefore call on all Members of this House, on both sides of the aisle, backbenchers and frontbenchers, to double down and work together to build happiness, prosperity and progress for our people. [Applause.]\\nResolved,\\n\"That the following Address in reply to the Speech of the President be agreed to:\\n\\'We, the Parliament of the Republic of Singapore, express our thanks to the President for the Speech which she delivered on behalf of the Government at the Opening of the Second Session of this Parliament.\\'.\"']"

      "The President (Mdm Halimah Yacob)\n",
      "Hon Members, please be seated. Parliament is reopening at an important milestone in our history.We have spent the last three years fighting the crisis of our generation. Together, we found our way through the uncertainties and fears of the pandemic.Because everyone played their part, we emerged stronger and more united than before. Social capital amongst Singaporeans has deepened, trust in Government has strengthened and our global reputation has been enhanced. These strengths will prove crucial on the road ahead.The worst of COVID-19 is now hopefully behind us. But there are new challenges ahead, as we enter an increasingly dangerous and troubled world.The war in Ukraine rages on and is unlikely to end soon. How the crisis unfolds will have major implications for the security of countries everywhere. The rivalry between US and China continues to intensify, and has recently taken a turn for the worse. Near-miss encounters are happening more frequently around the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea. Neither side wants to go to war, but events have their own momentum and accidents can easily spiral out of control in ways no one can predict. The global order is also being reshaped by strategic geopolitical rivalry. The major powers are focused more on unilaterally securing their own advantage, than on promoting mutual interdependence or strengthening the multilateral system. The international norms that underpin peace and prosperity in the world are under severe strain. These are realities we have to adapt to. As a small nation, we must take the world as it is, not as we wish it to be. But we are far from powerless on the international stage by acting together with like-minded partners, both big and small. We remain vigilant and proactive in defending ourselves against external threats. We will continue to build a network of friends to advance our shared interests. We will strive to preserve our sovereignty and the right to determine our own future, as we have done since Independence. Against the backdrop of great power rivalry, smaller countries like Singapore are experiencing growing pressures to take sides. We will be subject to foreign influences and disinformation campaigns, aimed at shaping our domestic public opinion and pressing the Government to adopt certain positions.  We must do our utmost to resist such pressures. We have to close ranks and stay united, regardless of race, religion, or political affiliation, especially when it comes to core national interests. We must never allow external parties to divide us and should always stand together as one people to uphold Singapore’s vital interests. Unity will also be important as we push forward against the economic headwinds. Global trade and investment flows are facing growing obstacles. Governments in the major economies are providing substantial fiscal support to develop strategic industries and strengthen their own industrial bases. This creates a more unlevel playing field and tougher competition for us. We will adapt to these new circumstances and find opportunities amidst the challenges. We cannot compete headto-head with big powers seeking to control key technologies and industries in the global economy. But we can be more agile and nimble than others, and respond more quickly and effectively to new challenges and opportunities.  We will run up against more binding constraints in land, labour and carbon over the coming years, and will have to do our best to manage them. But even as we adjust and adapt, a few fundamental imperatives will not change.  We must stay connected to the world, strengthen our connectivity infrastructure and entrench our position as a trusted and reliable business hub.  We must develop talents and skills of our people throughout their careers and continue to attract foreigners with entrepreneurial networks and expertise to help grow opportunities for Singaporeans.  We must invest in innovation to unlock new areas of growth, including in digitalisation and sustainability.  Importantly, we must nurture the strong tripartite partnership between Government, businesses and workers.If we are adaptable and resourceful, we can strengthen our competitive advantage, and position ourselves best to prosper and thrive in this new environment.To do well in this troubled world and remain one united people, we will need to strengthen our social fabric. Every Singaporean must feel that they have a stake in our country. The fruits of our progress must be shared fairly and no one should feel left behind. This is the main purpose of the Forward Singapore exercise: to renew and update our social compact even as we refresh our goals and strategies. Collectively, the 4G team have engaged more than 14,000 Singaporeans over the past six months and are continuing to deepen these engagements.  This exercise reaffirms the core values that we hold dear as Singaporeans: fairness, inclusivity, mutual support and the desire to give back to society. We want every person to be treated equally with dignity and respect. We want a Singapore where everyone belongs, and every citizen has the chance to achieve his or her fullest potential. We want a society that values and supports families; where we care for and help one another and pitch in to make a difference to our community. These values will shape the Government’s agenda. We will expand opportunities throughout life for every citizen, regardless of their starting points. We will strengthen social safety nets so that in every stage of life, Singaporeans can better cope with uncertainties and look forward with confidence. We will build a smart and liveable city – a green, connected and thriving metropolis that we are all proud to call home. We will deepen Singaporeans’ sense of shared identity and mutual responsibility towards one another.  These will be the key priorities for the remainder of this term of Government.   First, we will expand opportunities throughout life for all, regardless of individual backgrounds and circumstances.   Meritocracy has long been the organising principle of our society. It has provided opportunities to countless Singaporeans with the drive and ability to excel. But as we prosper as a society, those who have already done well will naturally seek to pass on their advantages to their children. This is why absent major upheavals, all societies tend to become more stratified and less socially mobile over time.  We will do our utmost to combat this tendency. We must not allow advantages and privileges to become entrenched and persist over generations. This would weaken and fracture our society. We must ensure a broader and more open meritocracy that works well for all Singaporeans. This means rethinking our approach to education and work.  We will continue to prepare our children for the future, starting from their early years. We will provide more resources to support those who start out with less. At the same time, we recognise the competitive stresses that have built up in our education system, especially amongst certain segments of society. We will provide everyone with access to a good education, and many chances in life to learn and improve. But let us not be unwittingly drawn into an educational arms race and end up worse off as a society.   We must also re-examine how society rewards different skills and talents and recognises the full range of pathways to success. We should accord greater value to those who are skilled with their hands and contribute through their technical and practical abilities, as well as those with the social and empathetic traits to excel in jobs, such as caregiving or community service. Every Singaporean must have the opportunity to take on work they find fulfilling and meaningful, build on their talents, give of their best and be rewarded fairly for it.  At the same time, we will step up support for the disadvantaged and vulnerable segments in our society. We will uplift lower-income workers and families, and empower them to take the initiative to improve their own lives. We will enhance support for persons with disabilities, so they can pursue their aspirations and participate fully as contributing members of society. We will ensure that Singapore remains an open and inclusive society, where we uplift everyone with opportunities throughout their lives and where we interact with one another as equals, regardless of our backgrounds.Second, in a world of rapid change, the Government will improve social safety nets to help Singaporeans better cope with disruptions and setbacks in life.With more uncertainty in the world economy and faster technological change, workers, especially those in their 40s and 50s, are at higher risk of skills obsolescence and unemployment. During the pandemic, we implemented the COVID-19 Recovery Grant and the SGUnited Jobs and Skills programme to support those who had lost their jobs. We will study how we should extend similar support beyond the pandemic.Beyond helping displaced workers, we will further strengthen our SkillsFuture ecosystem to bring everyone along on our digitalisation and industry transformation journey. We will enable every citizen to do a significant skills reboot in the course of their working lives. This will help to keep them employable, whether they progress further in their respective fields, or transit across to jobs in new areas of growth.We will also strengthen the sense of assurance in other ways.We will take better care of our growing number of seniors. Through HealthierSG, we are stepping up preventive care and empowering citizens to manage their own health, and go for regular screenings and check-ups.    We will help Singaporeans enjoy their golden years with greater peace of mind, by enhancing retirement adequacy, and expanding care and living options. We will enable more seniors to age in place, in the comfort of their own homes, with their families and friends close by.We will also keep public housing affordable and accessible for Singaporeans. Close to 100,000 private and public homes are expected to be completed between now and 2025. We are giving priority to young married couples and families with children to purchase their first homes.Third, we will press on with longer-term efforts to build a city that is green, connected and highly liveable.We will continue to renew and transform our urban landscape. New centres and districts will be developed outside of the Central Business District (CBD), to pilot creative urban solutions that transform the way our people live, work and play. Technology will be a key enabler; our urban plans will be integrated with our Smart Nation vision.  Our built environment is not just about better hardware and infrastructure. The city should also become more people-friendly. We will strengthen the distinctive cultures and heritages of different neighbourhoods. We will have better-connected streets and green spaces that are conducive for walking and cycling, where people can meet, interact and connect with one another. We will make our housing estates more vibrant spaces where children grow up together, where shared memories are formed and where we nurture our unique identity as a multi-racial and multi-religious nation.  Fourth, we will strengthen our collective responsibility to shape our new compact. More government action should not result in a greater sense of dependency and entitlement. Instead, the Government will, through its actions, reinforce individual and family efforts, and bring forth contributions from other stakeholders.For instance, employers must do their part to invest in their workers. Community partners must complement government efforts to support vulnerable families, just as we rallied to support one another through the pandemic. Those who have done well must pay it forward and give others a hand, so that we help one another stand tall with dignity and pride.  To tackle the complex challenges ahead, Singapore will need a stronger network of stakeholders to participate in nation building. Committed businesses that champion socially responsible and sustainable practices. A passionate civil society that advocates for their visions of a better society. An active citizenry that takes ownership of issues. The Government will do more to mobilise and involve all stakeholders. In particular, our youths show strong interest to take action and initiate change on issues they care about, like mental well-being and sustainability. We will engage the ideas, dynamism and energy of our young Singaporeans. Ultimately, our refreshed social compact is about a shared understanding of how we relate to and support one another in our next phase of nationhood. By pooling our individual expertise, experiences and resources, we can achieve better outcomes for ourselves, our fellow citizens and our nation, Singapore.Even as we focus on our present needs, we must also plan for the future and think on behalf of generations to come.  We are here today only because of what previous generations of Singaporeans did. They were willing to work hard and make sacrifices, to give us – their children and grandchildren – a better life. We must uphold these same values and leave behind a Singapore that is better than the one today, for the sake of future generations.Climate change poses an existential threat to our island state. We have committed to decisive action to reduce carbon emissions and are taking resolute steps towards meeting our net-zero commitments. We also need to protect ourselves against global warming, especially rising sea levels. We are developing plans for more extensive coastal protection measures and will dove-tail these plans with our urban renewal strategies.All this requires responsible use of our fiscal resources and husbanding of our accumulated reserves. We must therefore continue to uphold our longstanding principles of fiscal prudence and discipline, so that future generations too will have the means to weather major storms and the wherewithal to build the Singapore of their dreams. Throughout our nation building journey, we have repeatedly faced challenges and setbacks. We survived when few believed we would. When we started out in 1965, the journey looked so daunting, with so many problems to solve. But with courage and determination, our founding leaders and pioneer generations tackled challenges head-on, one by one, and built this thriving metropolis. We are now in a much stronger position – better poised to overcome our vulnerabilities and armed with crucial resources to push forward with confidence, however stormy the weather.  Our collective experiences have strengthened the mutual trust between Singaporeans and their confidence in our system of government. This virtuous circle relies on us partnering one another and working together to make the impossible, possible.  The leadership transition to the 4G team is well underway. They have worked well together and proven their ability and grit through their handling of the COVID-19 crisis. They have also been engaging citizens widely through the Forward Singapore exercise. They must continue to strengthen their bonds with Singaporeans, and work closely with them to write the next chapter of our Singapore Story.  The trust between our political leadership and people, and between Singaporeans themselves, is a key strength we must continue to nurture and cherish. In so many societies, this has gone wrong. These societies face deep divides that are difficult to bridge. Instead of bringing people together, political parties aggravate rifts by divisive appeals for support from competing groups. Their political systems are stuck in gridlock. Consequently, trust in government and its institutions plummets, making recovery even harder.  We cannot afford to let this happen in Singapore. In an open, diverse society, people will always have different views. We must debate them honestly and robustly. But our conversations also must be constructive, respectful and responsible, based on facts and sound analysis. Our interactions with one another must be anchored on mutual respect and trust, and a shared goal of advancing the larger public interest. In this way, we can work through our differences, enlarge our common ground and draw strength from our diverse perspectives.  So far, we have done well. Out of our diversity, we have built a deep reservoir of social capital and trust. As we commemorate the centenary of Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s birth, we should reflect on the values and principles of the founding generation of leaders. We should reaffirm and uphold our shared values, while re-examining what needs to be updated and possessing the courage to break new ground. Only then can we forge ahead confidently, firm in our footing and sure of our destination. The COVID-19 experience shows what Singaporeans are capable of when we come together as a nation, and gives us quiet confidence and strength as we face the future together. Let us learn from this experience to work together to improve the lives of today’s Singaporeans, keep faith with future generations yet unborn and build a Singapore that thrives and endures for many years to come.\n",
      "The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung)\n",
      "The Ministry of Health (MOH) will continue to deliver good health outcomes for Singaporeans, while keeping costs affordable for individuals and sustainable for Singapore. We have been able to achieve these objectives through the delivery of high-quality care, supported by a dedicated healthcare workforce and resilient infrastructure built up over the years, and a S+3M (subsidies, MediSave, MediShield Life, and MediFund) system that instils financial discipline while providing a safety net for patients who need it. The COVID-19 crisis has given us new perspectives on our pandemic preparedness plans and public health capabilities. Furthermore, our population is ageing rapidly. Medical advancements are not only opening up new possibilities but also major challenges and dilemmas. Singapore’s healthcare system is therefore at a pivotal phase of its transformation journey. MOH will strengthen our capabilities and structures by setting up a Communicable Diseases Agency to oversee disease preparedness, prevention and control, surveillance, risk assessment, and outbreak response. MOH will set up a permanent Crisis Strategy and Operations Group, to maintain surge readiness for mid-sized outbreaks and other health emergencies, and to prepare healthcare institutions to be crisis-ready. We will also maintain a healthcare reserve force, to expand surge capacity if necessary. MOH will continue to make progress on PREPARE, the Programme for Research in Epidemic Preparedness and Response, to develop our capabilities in global surveillance so we may better understand new and dangerous pathogens. We will implement our vaccine strategy, to secure an early supply of efficacious vaccines when another pandemic breaks out. We will also review the Infectious Diseases Act (IDA) to deal with a wider range of public health situations, and better manage crisis communications. We will continue to invest in healthcare infrastructure and expand our care capacity. This includes the Woodlands Health Campus, the Tan Tock Seng Hospital Integrated Care Hub, the Eastern Integrated Health Campus, and the redevelopment of Alexandra Hospital. In the next few years, we will add 1,900 (or about 20%) more public hospital beds, from 11,000 beds today. By 2030, we will build 10 more polyclinics, making a total of 32 polyclinics. We will also expand the capacity of our nursing homes from 16,000 beds in 2020 to more than 31,000 beds in 2030. We will invest heavily in IT, focusing on mission-critical national systems for hospital billing, drug ordering and dispensation, and the maintenance of national medical databases. We will continue to develop our healthcare workforce. We plan to increase our nursing and support care manpower by 40%, from 49,000 now to 69,000 by 2030, by building a stronger local pipeline through pre-employment training and mid-career conversions, and complementing our local core with foreign healthcare workers. With good training opportunities and career prospects, Singapore will remain competitive in attracting foreign healthcare manpower. More opportunities will be made available for doctors to become Family Physicians and develop their competencies, such as through postgraduate family medicine training. We will continue to upgrade the skills and knowledge of nurses and Allied Health Professionals, so that they can assume greater responsibilities, including in leading more clinical community care initiatives.While ageing and changes to our demography are inexorable, we can improve the health of our population through effective preventive care that spans the entire life of an individual. This will be a major focus in the coming years.Good health starts from the womb. We will enhance mental health screening and psycho-emotional support for pregnant women and their spouses, and support families in cultivating healthy lifestyle habits from young. As the child gets older, schools and preschools are important platforms to foster and sustain healthy habits. We will partner MOE and MSF closely, to incorporate health education in the school experience, and lay a strong foundation of health for our younger generation.  For adults, Healthier SG will be the key strategy to encourage healthy living and deliver preventive care. Enrolment into Healthier SG will start in July 2023, and this will kickstart the development of strong and dedicated patient-doctor relationships throughout society. Family doctors play an integral role in inculcating and strengthening good health habits, such a good diet, regular exercise, and routine health screenings and vaccinations. To support this effort, we are marshalling community resources and partners to organise physical activities in the community, and to reach out to residents and encourage them to enrol. Through the Health Promotion Board, we will continue to drive efforts to reduce sugar and sodium intake, equip consumers with information to make healthier eating choices, manage the consumption of tobacco and nicotine, and promote smoking cessation. By emphasising preventive care, Healthier SG brings healthcare out of hospitals and clinics, and into the community. We are therefore updating the Healthcare Services Act, to make regulations services-centric, instead of focusing on the premise where care is delivered. Similarly, we need to review our healthcare financing policies to make them more premise-neutral, and ensure support is available regardless of where care is sought. For our seniors we need to make ageing in community the default, because it is the best way for them to stay socially engaged and active, and hence healthy. As part of the Forward Singapore exercise, we are studying the specific measures to enable this. Broadly, our built environment must be made more senior-friendly, with new housing options such as Community Care Apartments, and existing common spaces such as void decks, parks, and coffee shops transformed into conducive environments for seniors. Our network of Active Ageing Centres will need to be expanded, and their operations remodelled, so that they can become nodes for seniors to make friends, volunteer, participate in active ageing programmes, and receive support for maintaining good health. As seniors approach end-of-life, we will seek to fulfil the wishes of the great majority to pass on in the comfort of their homes, surrounded by their loved ones. We will therefore strengthen support for palliative care by enhancing clinical protocols in hospitals to enable more seamless care transitions, upskilling healthcare workers, and engaging Singaporeans in conversations on their preferences. We will also enhance financial support for palliative care and ensure sufficient capacity across all settings to meet growing needs.We are in a period of major breakthroughs in medical science, especially in areas like precision medicine, gene editing, and artificial intelligence. For instance, with precision medicine, we can consider individual variations in genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors when predicting the health risks of individuals, and determine the most effective prevention and treatment strategies for them. At the same time, there will likely be a proliferation of experimental treatments, such as genetic therapies. We need to support and embrace technological advances but remain aware of the risks and pitfalls. Experimental treatments tend to work only on a small minority, so mass deployment of new treatments must be subject to evidence-based clinical development and evaluation of cost and medical effectiveness. Even as new medical technology becomes established, it will likely be costly and deployed only in specific circumstances. This would require a rethink of our healthcare financing policies, especially the role of medical insurance and MediShield Life. We may also need new legislation to safeguard moral and ethical standards in the practice of new medical technology such as precision medicine. MOH will undertake this long-term effort in partnership with researchers, physicians, economists, bioethicists, regulatory bodies, and the public, to reap the benefits of these new solutions. \n",
      "The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee)\n",
      "The Ministry of National Development (MND) will continue to ensure that we develop sustainably, build an endearing home and a distinctive global city, and meet the diverse aspirations of Singaporeans. Through the Long-Term Plan Review and the Forward Singapore exercise, we engaged over 30,000 Singaporeans to understand their values, hopes, and concerns for the future, including what a refreshed social compact for public housing should look like. We will update our housing and planning strategies to reflect the concerns and aspirations of our time. These strategies will be translated into detailed land use and development plans for the next ten to fifteen years in the upcoming Master Plan review. While the construction sector was severely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have made good progress to get back on track. Across the Housing and Development Board (HDB)’s Build-To-Order programme and private residential developments, there will be almost 40,000 home completions in 2023, and close to 100,000 by 2025. We will continue to maintain a steady pipeline to meet housing demand, and adjust our policies as necessary to keep the property market stable and sustainable.Our public housing programme has enabled eight in 10 Singaporean households to live in HDB flats today. We must continue to update our public housing programmes and policies as our city develops and society matures. Nearly one in four Singaporeans will be 65 years and older by 2030. We also have more singles and caregivers in our society, and more young Singaporeans aspire to live independently. In addition, our public housing estates and HDB flats are ageing. Many non-mature estates have also become much more well-developed over time. We will refresh our social compact on housing, so that housing continues to be affordable and accessible, and our estates remain inclusive, cohesive and sustainable. (a) We are committed to supporting families. We will help young married couples and families with children buy their very first home. (b) We will keep public housing inclusive, including in our prime areas. We will continue to launch flats under the Prime Location Public Housing model. (c) We will pair housing with proactive social support to uplift lower income families and help them move towards home ownership. (d) We will develop a range of housing options and provide stronger support for singles, seniors, as well as persons with disabilities. (e) We will design and build estates to forge strong communities, bring Singaporeans closer together, and integrate how we live, work and play.(f) We will rejuvenate and upgrade existing housing estates to improve the quality of our living environment.(g) We will work together with Singaporeans to promote social norms in our neighbourhoods that reflect our values of mutual respect and care for one another. Ultimately, our new social compact on housing represents a consensus among Singaporeans on our priorities as a nation and how we should allocate finite land and limited resources to meet growing aspirations. We must also set aside enough land and resources for future generations, to meet their aspirations and needs. MND will continue to plan boldly for the long-term, carefully balancing different needs and executing detailed plans to keep our city-state green, vibrant, and inclusive. We will embark on big moves and create more space by transforming the Greater Southern Waterfront and relocating Paya Lebar Airbase so that new and sustainable towns can be built. We will continue to make concerted efforts to retain and weave in our uniquely Singaporean identity as we develop Singapore. We have evolved from a “Garden City” to a “City in a Garden”, and now aspire to be a City in Nature, where native flora and fauna thrive amid a flourishing, urban metropolis. We will secure and extend our natural capital for generations to enjoy, and continue to build a productive and vibrant city, while strengthening the distinctive character and heritage of our towns and neighbourhoods. We will design our districts to connect with our shared memories of the area, which amplifies our Singaporean identity and provides residents with a sense of belonging, ownership, and community. We will plan for a range of possibilities as far ahead as possible, and introduce greater flexibility and optionality in our land use plans, so we can respond nimbly to crises and challenges. By carefully pacing out development plans, we can also better respond to changes in land use needs. To protect our city from the effects of climate change, we will deploy both infrastructure and nature-based solutions. These plans need to be supported by a strong and progressive built environment sector. The refreshed Built Environment Industry Transformation Map reflects our resolve to design, construct, and maintain our buildings in a more productive and sustainable manner, while strengthening our resilience against future challenges. We will support the growth of stronger firms with deeper capabilities, reduce our reliance on foreign manpower, and streamline regulatory processes. We will also ramp up efforts to reduce building emissions as we move towards our national climate target of net zero emissions by 2050.We will continue to partner Singaporeans to ensure that Singapore remains a distinctive and thriving city, with inclusive neighbourhoods and endearing homes for all Singaporeans.\n",
      "The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M)\n",
      "The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) will strengthen families as the bedrock of our society. We will build a more caring and inclusive society, drawing on the strengths of individuals and families, the social capital within our communities, and resources from the public, people and private sectors, to provide a tapestry of support to uplift those in need. We will implement the Singapore Made For Families 2025 plan, which outlines the efforts of the Government, community partners, and businesses to create a Singapore where all families are valued and supported. We will strengthen the Families For Life (FFL) movement. FFL will establish a presence in all towns by 2025 in partnership with Family Service Centres (FSCs). This will provide families more convenient access to peer support groups, marriage preparation, parenting and grandparenting programmes at the local community level. For families that face more challenges, we will provide timely family-centric interventions such as marriage support for minor and young marriages, divorce support, and family counselling. We will do this through the nationwide network of 10 FSCs offering the Strengthening Families Programme. We will continue to invest heavily in the early childhood sector to provide all children access to affordable and quality preschools. By 2025, 80% of pre-schoolers can have a place in a Government-supported preschool with affordable fees. We will enhance training and career progression for early childhood educators, keep salaries and working conditions competitive, and maintain the high quality of preschool education.In our Forward Singapore conversations, parents expressed their desire for more options to care for their young children, especially infants. We will study new care options apart from infant care facilities, to meet varying preferences and needs. We will continue working towards our shared vision where men and women partner each other as equals. One key area is to encourage greater women’s representation in leadership roles, building on the good progress made in raising the proportion of women on boards.We will enable persons with disabilities (PwDs) to live independent and fulfilling lives, through the Enabling Masterplan 2030. SG Enable will launch regional Enabling Business and Enabling Services hubs to provide employment support to, and bring social support services closer to PwDs and their caregivers. MSF will also expand capacity in early intervention services and make preschools more inclusive to support children with developmental needs. To foster a more caring and inclusive society, we will work with corporates and the community to shift mindsets and enhance support for families with PwDs in areas such as cost of care and post-school life. We will strengthen our social safety nets for lower-income families and enable them to bounce back stronger. ComCare will be regularly updated to reflect basic expenditure patterns of lower-income families.Early childhood development for children from lower-income families will start them on the right path. We will close the gap in preschool participation rates of children from lower-income families with their peers. We will scale up KidSTART nation-wide by 2026 and facilitate priority enrolment for children from lower-income families in Anchor Operator Preschools and MOE Kindergartens by age three.We will also ensure that social services are comprehensive, convenient, and coordinated so that vulnerable families can get the help they need quickly and easily. To this end, Community Link (ComLink) officers and volunteer befrienders have adopted a family-centric approach in supporting families with children living in rental housing. MSF will also be integrating social programmes under ComLink, such as KidSTART, UPLIFT Community Network, and Project Dian@M3. We are studying how to empower ComLink families to take further action to improve their circumstances and that of their children, by augmenting and supplementing their efforts to uplift themselves. Through Forward Singapore, we will strengthen partnerships with volunteers, the community, and corporates to help these families achieve stability, self-reliance, and social mobility. We will take a family-based approach to rehabilitate youth offenders, so that they can turn their lives around. We will also work with the community to protect families at risk of domestic violence. We have made it easier and more convenient for those experiencing or witnessing domestic violence to make reports, so that survivors can get help from social service professionals. We will amend the Women’s Charter to better protect survivors and hold perpetrators accountable even as we support their rehabilitation. Twenty twenty-three is the Year of Celebrating Social Service Partners for the good work of social service agencies (SSAs), businesses, and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs). We will accord similar recognition to social service professionals and volunteers. We will continue to partner SSAs in their transformation and extend more support through the Community Capability Trust, so that their digitalisation processes, people practices, and volunteer management capabilities are future-ready. To ensure effective service delivery, we will prioritise funding for outcomes and improve data sharing and integrated case management through platforms such as Case Connect and One Client View. We will also reduce administrative and regulatory burden and streamline reporting requirements while still ensuring good governance. To grow the attractiveness of social service sector jobs, we will enhance skills training, guide SSAs to pay competitively through the updated NCSS Sector Salary Guidelines, and improve working conditions. Businesses and organisations have assets, expertise and networks they can creatively leverage to support their philanthropic efforts and create sustained social impact. MSF will partner businesses to strengthen the social impact in their Environmental, Social, and Governance policies. We will also strengthen collaborations with IHLs and academics to train social service professionals, and to undertake research to inform our policies and practices. We will create a Singapore made for families, give every child a good start, and help every family achieve stability, self-reliance and social mobility. Together, we can secure a better future for ourselves and our children.\n",
      "The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing)\n",
      "The Ministry of Education (MOE) strives to enable all Singaporeans to realise their potential. We have been engaging our stakeholders as part of the Forward Singapore exercise. We will strengthen our partnerships with families, communities, and industry to refresh our system of meritocracy, so that all can thrive and contribute to Singapore in their own ways. MOE is committed to providing a quality education and a strong foundation for every child. In a complex and fast-changing world, our students will require diverse skillsets to stay resilient, and diverse perspectives to connect and collaborate with others in Singapore and elsewhere. MOE will thus continue to encourage holistic development and cultivate 21st Century Competencies. To meet the wider and more complex needs of our students, we will support our educators by giving them opportunities to broaden their perspectives and skillsets. We will also partner families and the community to provide holistic support for our children’s socio-emotional development.We have moved away from a one-size-fits-all approach to education, and from using a single metric to evaluate the diverse dimensions of our students’ abilities. Full Subject-Based Banding will be fully implemented in secondary schools next year and will allow every student to learn subjects at a level that caters to their strengths and learning needs. Our schools are building partnerships with their stakeholders to offer niche areas of excellence to cater to students’ diverse interests. We will also continue to expand admission routes to schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to recognise the different strengths and abilities of our students.Every child should have access to quality education, according to their needs, regardless of their starting point in life. We will continue to invest more in preschool education, especially for children from disadvantaged families. We will also step up our efforts to provide opportunities for learners of different backgrounds to interact, empathise with, and support one another. At the same time, to adapt to a changing global landscape, we will need to break new ground. First, amidst economic transformation and labour market disruptions, we must evolve our practices to create new value and stay ahead of the competition. To enable Singaporeans to seize new opportunities and stay employable, we will strengthen our SkillsFuture movement to better support continual upskilling and reskilling across an individual’s lifetime. This includes making training accessible for adult learners, developing new andragogical approaches, and working closely with companies, unions, and training institutions to tighten the nexus between business needs, workers’ skills and training. We will provide stronger support for mid-career workers, in particular, to reduce their opportunity cost for training should they require a substantial skills reboot. At the same time, our people will need to make full use of these opportunities by developing a growth mindset and passion for lifelong learning.Second, we will strengthen support for students with Special Educational Needs (SEN). We will continue to strengthen the educational experience for students with SEN in mainstream and Special Education (SPED) schools. MOE will work with Social Service Agencies to improve remuneration and career progression in the SPED sector. This will improve the quality of SPED and better enable our students to lead independent and meaningful lives.Third, we will leverage technology to better customise teaching and learning for students of different abilities. We will continue to invest in education technologies to bring out the best in each child. For example, adaptive learning platforms, powered by Artificial Intelligence, will allow more advanced learners to stretch themselves, while freeing up time for our teachers to focus on students with greater learning needs. All of us have a part to play in shaping and strengthening our social compact. Those who have done well in life should pay it forward, and support those who have less. Success must be defined not just by one’s achievements, but also by how we contribute to the common good. By moving beyond the pursuit of paper qualifications and embracing a broader definition of success, our education system can bring out the best in every child and strengthen our resilience as a nation through our diversity of strengths.\n",
      "The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng)\n",
      "As we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, economic and geopolitical uncertainties are expected to weigh on the labour market. To tackle these challenges, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) will redouble our efforts to expand opportunities, strengthen support and assurance, and foster fair, inclusive, and safe workplaces for Singaporeans. As part of the Forward Singapore exercise, MOM and the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) have been engaging Singaporeans from all walks of life. Many are concerned about staying relevant and competitive, and having job opportunities that match their aspirations.As our economy transforms, MOM will empower Singaporean workers to take charge of their careers and improve their career prospects and resilience. MOM has launched Jobs Transformation Maps to provide individuals with insights on how technology will affect their jobs and how they can proactively take measures to remain competitive and relevant. Singaporeans can also tap on employment facilitation programmes by Workforce Singapore to chart out their career paths. We will be launching CareersFinder, a feature on the MyCareersFuture portal, to help workers plan for their next career move using data and artificial intelligence. For workers who face displacement, we will help them in their job search. For those inclined towards “hands-on” work, MOM will work with NTUC to professionalise skilled trades, to attract and retain more Singaporeans in such jobs through better salaries and clearer progression ladders. We have made headway in uplifting the image and attractiveness of skilled professions that work with the “heart”, such as nursing and early childhood education. We must do likewise for trades that emphasise craft and skills mastery.MOM also aims to build up a stronger local pipeline for corporate leadership positions. We want to see more Singaporeans becoming specialists and leaders in their chosen fields of our economy and growing their careers in Singapore and on the global stage.MOM will also support employers to grow and transform. Only with strong companies can we have a vibrant economy and good job opportunities. To this end, we will support our local workforce to constantly improve, even as Singapore remains open to foreign manpower that complements locals. From September 2023, we will roll out the Complementarity Assessment Framework (COMPASS) for new Employment Pass (EP) applications. Through COMPASS, we will encourage companies to build strong and diverse teams, with Singaporeans and skilled EP holders working alongside and learning from one another. The COMPASS Shortage Occupation List allows firms to access applicants with highly specialised skills, while the Strategic Economic Priorities bonus facilitates applications from firms that support Singapore’s strategic priorities. We will also support businesses that contribute to our strategic priorities with additional Work Permit and S Pass quotas via the Manpower for Strategic Economic Priorities scheme.Our growth has been and must continue to be inclusive. We have made progress in looking after vulnerable workers and will press on with our efforts. We will invest heavily to uplift the salaries and skills of lower-wage workers, and help them progress in their careers. By July 2023, up to nine in ten lower-wage workers will benefit from Progressive Wages (PWs). We have also enhanced the Workfare Income Supplement scheme to increase maximum payments and expand coverage to half a million lower-wage workers. With the recently launched PW Mark, consumers and corporate buyers can play their part to support firms that pay progressive wages. Seniors who want and are able to continue working should have maximum access to employment opportunities. We have been raising the retirement and re-employment ages progressively, and have extended the Senior Employment Credit and Part-time Re-employment Grant until 2025 to provide employers with wage offsets. In addition, we have enhanced the Enabling Employment Credit to raise wage offsets to employers who hire unemployed persons with disabilities. We have also introduced a new Uplifting Employment Credit to incentivise firms to hire ex-offenders. A substantial group of workers provide services, such as deliveries and vehicle rides, via digital platforms. They need better protection. We have accepted the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Platform Workers and will require platform companies to provide platform workers with work injury compensation and Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions. Platform workers will also be able to seek formal representation and negotiate for their collective interests.A decade ago, about five in ten active CPF members were able to attain their cohort Basic Retirement Sum at age 55. This has improved to almost seven in ten today and is expected to reach about eight in ten in 2027.We are undertaking a fundamental review of our policies for retirement adequacy under the Forward Singapore exercise. We will bolster retirement adequacy and make sure the CPF system continues to work for the broad majority of Singaporeans. We will raise the CPF monthly salary ceiling to keep pace with rising incomes, which will help middle-income workers save more during their working years. Ultimately, we seek to assure all Singaporeans that as long as they work and contribute consistently to their CPF, they will be able to meet their basic retirement needs. We will also find ways to look after those who are unable to work consistently or who have a shorter runway of working years.MOM will continue to foster fair, inclusive, and safe workplaces, shape workplace norms, and ensure an even playing field for all.Employers must pay attention to fair consideration when hiring. We will require employers, by law, to advertise jobs on MyCareersFuture and fairly consider all candidates, before applying for an EP or S Pass. We will enact workplace fairness legislation to provide stronger protection against workplace discrimination and enable workers to seek redress for harm done. We will also continue to shape the right norms to help make our workplace practices more flexible. By 2024, we will introduce Tripartite Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs) to help employers and employees adopt FWAs in a win-win manner. Even one workplace death is one too many. We remain committed to advancing workplace safety and health, and will strive towards our 2028 target to reduce the workplace fatal injury rate to below 1.0 per 100,000 workers. MOM must continue to be both pro-worker and pro-business. We will build on the strong foundation of tripartism to journey hand-in-hand, step-by-step with all workers and businesses towards a better future.\n",

      "The Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) seeks to enhance opportunities, sustain trust and strengthen our communities to reap the full benefits of digital and technological advances, while mitigating the potential harms. MCI will work with partners to develop a new Digital Connectivity Blueprint for strategic, sustainable, and future-ready digital infrastructure. We will also continue investing in research and innovation, including in quantum technologies and artificial intelligence, as part of Singapore’s Research, Innovation, and Enterprise 2025 Plan. These efforts to enhance digital infrastructure and encourage innovation are the foundation for our businesses and people to thrive in a digital age. MCI will continue to support digital transformation of our businesses, particularly to help Small-Medium Enterprises improve their productivity and access new markets. MCI will scale adoption of digital utilities that support core business functions, such as e-payment and e-invoicing. MCI will also refresh the schemes to help firms improve their cybersecurity posture and raise their overall digital maturity. These will be brought together under the new Digital Enterprise Blueprint, a comprehensive guide to the Government’s support for enterprise digitalisation. We will also work with partners to shape international rules, benchmarks, and norms, through Digital Economy Agreements and other initiatives. MCI will continue to help Singaporeans raise their digital proficiencies, both to access digital services and navigate confidently online, as well as to access good opportunities in tech. Initiatives under the Information and Communications Jobs Transformation Map will equip tech workers with the tools to stay competitive. We will also help workers, both within the information and communications sector and across the economy, upskill and deepen their proficiencies in high-demand areas such as 5G, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity. As part of the Forward Singapore exercise, we will work with the Ministry of Manpower and Ministry of Education, as well as industry partners, to ensure that good opportunities remain accessible to all, through initiatives such as the TechSkills Accelerator for ITE and Polytechnics Alliance.Trust among our people, and in our institutions and systems, is essential to the continued vitality and resilience of our society and economy. MCI takes a comprehensive approach to building and strengthening trust.MCI will continue to protect users from harmful online content, with codes of practice for social media services and app stores, and advisory guidelines for the protection of personal data. Through the Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021, MCI and the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore will also enhance efforts to protect our critical information infrastructure and other important systems and entities from cyber threats, and raise the cybersecurity posture of companies and individuals through the Cybersecurity Labelling Scheme and Cybersecurity Trust and Essentials Mark certification programmes. MCI, together with partners from industry, academia, and the community, will grow the digital, information, and media literacy of Singaporeans, and promote better social cohesion, wellness, and health outcomes. MCI will continue to coordinate Whole-of-Government public communications on major national issues to ensure that the public receives timely and accurate information. MCI will also support efforts to protect public interest and trust by providing the public with a reliable source for facts, addressing misperceptions, and alerting the public to scams and other threats.MCI is committed to building and strengthening our Singapore communities in both offline and online spaces. We will continue to provide timely, accessible, and inclusive Government communications, through in-person engagements as well as traditional and digital media platforms, to reach Singaporeans from all walks of life. We will also engage the community through REACH, to better understand stakeholders’ views, needs, and aspirations.All Singaporeans should be able to participate meaningfully in society and reap the benefits of digital technologies, regardless of ability or personal circumstances. MCI will expand its digital inclusion efforts by:(a) providing subsidised devices and internet access under the DigitalAccess@Home and Mobile Access for Seniors schemes; (b) offering tailored training and assistance for the elderly and other groups through the Info-communications Media Development Authority’s SG Digital Office; (c) organising outreach efforts under the National Library Board’s Libraries and Archives Blueprint 2025; and (d) mounting people, private and public partnerships under the Digital for Life movement. Access to credible sources of information and content that reflect our Singapore voice and values is vital to our social cohesion, cultural heritage, and national identity. MCI will support the creation and delivery of high-quality news and content across various media platforms and languages to the public. We will also continue efforts to implement subtitling or sign language interpretations for more free-to-air television programmes.MCI is committed to doing our part, alongside the public and our partners, to meet the challenges ahead and build a thriving digital future for all.\n",

      "Even as Singapore’s economy emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic, new challenges have surfaced. In the near-term, persistent global inflation and a weak global demand outlook will weigh on Singapore’s growth. We will also need to respond to major structural shifts, including an increasingly fragmented geopolitical landscape, accelerating disruptions from emerging technologies, and the global momentum on climate change. Domestically, we will need to pursue economic growth amidst tighter manpower, land and carbon constraints. The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) will step up efforts to grow Singapore’s economy, create good jobs and support businesses and workers in seizing new opportunities. We can turn the challenges ahead into opportunities. Through the way we managed the pandemic, we have proven to businesses and investors that we are reliable partners. The Government will continue to build on our strong fundamentals of efficient infrastructure, extensive connectivity, a highly skilled workforce, and an enabling policy environment, to capture growth opportunities. MTI will press on with our journey towards the Singapore Economy 2030 vision to achieve longer-term, sustainable growth, by expanding our trade, capturing opportunities in the manufacturing and services sectors, and uplifting our enterprises and workers. We will also implement the plans under the Industry Transformation Maps 2025 to strengthen our industries and workforce capabilities.Singapore must continue to remain open, expand our economic space and stay connected to global growth opportunities. Even as other countries adopt more protectionist measures, Singapore will expand and diversify our trading activities and markets, capture more re-exports and transhipments, and embed Singapore deeper into global supply chains. This strengthens our relevance as a global business hub and anchors high-value economic activities and good jobs here. We will also strengthen our international partnerships to capture new opportunities, arising from Asia’s growth and global trends in digital trade and sustainability. Our growth strategies must be coupled with efforts to secure economic resilience amid heightened risk of global supply chain disruptions. MTI will coordinate supply chain resilience efforts across government to secure critical supplies for Singapore.MTI will help our industries capture opportunities in growth areas and support them in their transformation journey to become more productive and competitive. We will build a strong base of advanced manufacturing industries, including by leveraging technologies such as biotechnology and robotics. Capitalising on global sustainability and digitalisation trends, we will strengthen Singapore’s position as a leading international green hub and seize opportunities in the digital economy. We will also strengthen the nexus between research, innovation and commercialisation to enhance Singapore’s competitive advantage. At the same time, we will address our carbon, land, and manpower resource constraints. We will secure alternative forms of low-carbon energy and support enterprises to improve energy efficiency and reduce their carbon footprint. We will maximise the economic value from the use of industrial land and continue to attract global talent and rainmakers with skills that are complementary to our workforce.Thriving enterprises and an agile workforce are crucial to our next phase of growth. MTI will work closely with industry stakeholders to empower businesses to transform and workers to upskill to seize opportunities. We will deepen enterprises’ research and development capabilities and capacity for market-oriented innovation so they can respond more effectively to the changing operating context. We will lower barriers to entry by streamlining regulations and improving service delivery. We will, through a bespoke approach, help promising enterprises internationalise and grow into future Singapore Global Enterprises. Enterprises will also receive support to develop capabilities in sustainability.  Our people are the core of our economy. MTI will work with the Ministry of Manpower and Ministry of Education to equip our people with industry-relevant skillsets and ensure better alignment of training to industry needs. MTI will focus our efforts to drive economic growth and create good jobs. We will work with stakeholders to uplift enterprises and workers to capture opportunities and chart the path towards a prosperous and vibrant Singapore.\n",
      "The Senior Minister, Coordinating Minister for Social Policies and Minister-in-charge of The Monetary Authority of Singapore (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam)\n",
      "The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) seeks to secure sustained non-inflationary economic growth, a robust and resilient financial sector, and Singapore’s position as a leading international financial centre in Asia.Major central banks have increased interest rates at an unprecedented pace amid persistent inflationary pressures. Tighter financial conditions globally are helping to dampen inflation, at the cost of slower economic growth and increased financial market stresses. Downside risks to global growth have increased, even as continuing labour market pressures keep inflation elevated. Against this backdrop, the Singapore economy will expand at a slower pace in 2023. Inflation is expected to moderate during the year but will remain higher than the historical norm.MAS has steadily tightened monetary policy since October 2021. This has helped to dampen inflation and anchor inflation expectations. MAS will continue to focus on ensuring medium-term price stability as the basis for sustained economic growth.Amid volatile international financial markets and stresses in global banking, MAS will seek to safeguard the safety and resilience of Singapore’s financial sector. Through regular risk assessments and close supervisory monitoring, MAS ensures that banks in Singapore are well-capitalised, keep healthy liquidity positions, and are underpinned by a stable and diversified funding base. In addition, MAS reviews banks’ regular internal stress tests against interest rate, credit and other risks. MAS also conducts an annual industry-wide stress test of key financial institutions in Singapore. MAS stands ready to provide liquidity through a range of facilities to ensure that Singapore’s financial system remains stable and financial markets continue to function in an orderly manner at times of global stress.MAS has partnered the financial industry to develop the Industry Transformation Map (ITM) 2025. It sets out five key growth strategies for the financial sector for 2021 to 2025: enhance asset class strengths, digitalise financial infrastructure, catalyse Asia’s net-zero transition, shape the future of financial networks, and foster a skilled and adaptable workforce. The ITM aims to achieve growth of 4%-5% and net job creation of 3,000 to 4,000 per year for the financial services sector, over the five-year period. The financial sector is on track to achieving these targets, growing by an average 4.8% per year and adding an average 7,300 jobs per year during 2021 to 2022.MAS will catalyse insurance risk advisory and alternative risk transfer solutions for Asia. We will position Singapore as Asia’s centre for philanthropy by building philanthropy advisory competencies and solutions. We will develop private credit to complement private equity and venture capital funding. MAS will anchor promising FinTech start-ups in Web 3.0, artificial intelligence, and green FinTech. We will also continue to work with the financial industry to broaden and deepen the electronic foreign exchange trading ecosystem in Singapore.We will help develop an ecosystem of stakeholders to mobilise capital and support Asia’s transition to a net-zero emissions future. We will develop clear taxonomy criteria to identify green and transition activities for eight key sectors in 2023. We will promote the scaling up of blended and transition finance, to facilitate the decarbonisation of key sectors of the economy. We will also enhance sustainability disclosures and develop data utilities which will facilitate corporate disclosures and investors’ access to companies’ Environmental, Social, and Governance data.From the angle of financial stability, MAS will also work with the industry to enhance its resilience to the risks posed by climate change.Together with industry partners, MAS will accelerate efforts to develop new digital infrastructure and platforms to enhance industry efficiency, access new markets, and promote new models in digital finance. In bond markets, we will develop infrastructure to facilitate more seamless end-to-end issuance, listing and settlement for Asian securities transactions. In the funds industry, we will work with industry participants to pilot digital utilities to reduce settlement time, enhance the efficiency and transparency of post-trade funds settlement for fund managers.MAS will continue to enhance cross-border payment connectivity with key partner jurisdictions. We have established bilateral real-time cross-border payment linkages with Thailand and India, and are currently working with Malaysia on a similar linkage. MAS is also working with the Bank for International Settlements Innovation Hub on a multilateral solution to link fast payment systems within ASEAN. Through these linkages, users in Singapore and our partner jurisdictions are now able to transfer funds directly to one another’s bank accounts or e-wallets almost instantly using a mobile number or Quick Response code. Together with the industry, MAS will help evolve an innovative and responsible digital asset ecosystem. We are exploring the potential of distributed ledger technology in promising use cases, particularly in cross-border payment and settlement, trade finance, and pre- and post-trade capital market activities. We are also working with the industry to explore the potential of tokenisation of financial and real economy assets. MAS and the Institute of Banking & Finance will work closely with the industry and tripartite partners to continuously upskill the financial sector workforce and develop deep capabilities for the future of finance.We will build competencies in growth areas, provide training support for finance professionals at different stages of their careers, develop specialist talent in areas, such as sustainability and technology, and groom future leaders in finance through opportunities to gain international exposure and build valuable networks.\n",
      "The Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies and Chairman of the National Research Foundation (Mr Heng Swee Keat)\n",
      "The National Research Foundation (NRF) seeks to build a thriving Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) ecosystem that drives an innovation economy and addresses Singapore’s national imperatives. Over the years, our RIE investments have benefited Singapore and Singaporeans. Investments in biomedical sciences and medical technology since the 1990s have set the foundation for the flourishing sectors they are today. As of 2020, Singapore hosts more than 30 regional headquarters (HQs) in the sector, many of which are from the world’s top pharmaceutical and med-tech firms. The biomedical sector supports 25,000 jobs and makes up almost 4% of our GDP.We will support the next bound of Singapore’s economic transformation by advancing Singapore’s capabilities in strategic technology areas. This will unlock new opportunities for growth and create good jobs for Singaporeans. For example, in the area of semiconductors, our public research institutes and universities are collaborating with industry through corporate laboratories and joint projects, to work on new materials, designs, and manufacturing techniques that can drive the next generation of more efficient and powerful chips. These innovations will enable advances in wide-ranging applications such as wearables, communications equipment and vehicles, and expand the base of semiconductor manufacturing activities and jobs in Singapore. Artificial intelligence (AI) is another technology with transformative potential. We will continue to attract top AI talent and spur the development of innovative AI solutions that generate value for businesses and society. We will continue to support transformation efforts of businesses across industry sectors by creating new and improved solutions that leverage science and technology. We are scaling up platforms that bring together our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), public research institutes and industry, so that technological advancements in areas, such as medical diagnostics and additive manufacturing, are more quickly commercialised. Companies can also establish corporate laboratories with our public research performers to address their industry challenges or tap on Centres of Innovation for technical and business advisory to support their journey to become product builders. We will also strengthen Singapore's position as an attractive Global-Asia node for businesses to conduct research and development (R&D) and innovation, tapping on our diverse workforce, vibrant RIE ecosystem, and connections to fast-growing markets. This will build on the growth in Singapore's Business Expenditure on Research & Development, which has risen from about S$1.9 billion in 2000 to about S$6.6 billion in 2020. Many large corporations and multinationals have anchored their R&D centres in Singapore. Small-Medium Enterprises are also growing their innovation ambition and capabilities by tapping on capabilities in the IHLs and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), and on platforms, such as the Global Innovation Alliance, which provide access to enterprise partners, talent and markets in international innovation hubs. Our startup ecosystem continues to grow, with a more than 20-fold increase in venture capital funding raised in Singapore, from about S$500 million in 2011 to about S$11 billion in 2022. This includes promising deep-tech startups. In the next phase, as part of the Singapore Global Enterprises Initiative to build more locally-grown, high-growth and globally competitive companies, we will provide customised financial support for promising enterprises to build sustained R&D and innovation capacity.In addition to its economic importance, RIE has been critical in addressing Singapore’s challenges in areas, such as public health and resource resilience. Our R&D capabilities in biomedical sciences and infectious diseases enabled us to respond to COVID-19 quickly. Singapore was one of the first countries to successfully culture the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We also developed several diagnostic test-kits that were rapidly deployed for use both locally and overseas. Our early investments to diversify our water sources, such as creating and adapting technologies for NEWater and desalination, have also helped make our water supply more secure and resilient.We will continue to invest in R&D to tackle ongoing and future challenges, for instance, to improve our pandemic preparedness by bolstering our vaccine development capabilities. To respond to the existential threat of climate change, we are deepening our investments in low carbon energy research and strengthening our climate adaptation R&D efforts, including by investing in coastal protection and flood management research. Food resilience is another pressing area. We are investing in food R&D particularly in aquaculture, urban agriculture, alternative proteins, and food safety, to strengthen our food security while reaping economic benefits. A robust talent pool is a key enabler for good RIE investment outcomes. The number of public and industry researchers in Singapore more than doubled from 20,000 in 2000 to 46,000 in 2020. We will continue to build a strong core of local research talent by nurturing our youths’ interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields, and providing diverse pathways for those who wish to take up research careers. As a small nation and global city, we must remain open to top international talent. We are expanding our global collaborations in research and innovation to address complex problems that cannot be solved by one country alone, including through the Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE), a collaborative research hub with foreign universities and international research organisations. We will also continue to enhance the porosity of research talent across academia, public research institutes and industry, for instance, by seconding public researchers to local enterprises. We are working with industry to enhance their research capacity, through initiatives such as the Industrial Postgraduate Programme which provide opportunities for postgraduate students to undertake industrial R&D projects with companies. To grow the pool of deep-tech talent with Innovation & Enterprise and technology commercialisation skills, we also have on-the-job training programmes, which are accessible to mid-career professionals.Our RIE investments have created a strong foundation for Singapore to remain competitive amidst rapid technological changes. We must continue to leverage and build Singapore’s science and technology capabilities to meet imminent needs and challenges, capture new economic opportunities and support our businesses and workforce.\n",
      "The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen)\n",
      "A strong defence safeguards Singapore’s sovereignty and ensures peace and security for Singaporeans’ pursuit of economic and social progress.The geopolitical and security landscape Singapore faces is becoming more volatile and complex. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and rising contestation between the United States and China have reduced trust among countries. Divisions are rising in different spheres, while the multilateral rules-based order that has underpinned cross-border cooperation and conflict resolution is unravelling. Access to a growing range of sophisticated technologies has enabled malicious actors to pose significant security threats, including terrorist acts, hostile information campaigns, and cyberattacks on critical infrastructure.Amidst these turbulent times, steady and long-term investment in a strong defence is critical. The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and SAF are transforming to deter and defend against emerging and evolving threats in multiple domains, across the spectrum from peace to war. New and more advanced aerial, maritime, and land platforms will be introduced. These include a new fleet of twelve F-35B Joint Strike Fighter aircraft and four Invincible-class submarines by the early 2030s, as well as next-generation Howitzers and Armoured Tracked Carriers. The newly formed Digital and Intelligence Service (DIS) will expand the SAF’s digital capabilities and play a critical role in Singapore’s national defence against cyber and information threats. Technology remains a key force multiplier for the SAF. We will employ more unmanned platforms to extend the reach and survivability of our forces. For more timely and accurate operational decision-making, the SAF will build up its digital capabilities and deploy data analytics and artificial intelligence in future command and control information systems. The DIS will develop a digital range to train our forces under realistic cyberattack scenarios and set up a Digital Ops-Tech Centre to enable our operational and defence technology workforces to collaborate on new digital solutions. Beyond utilising military technologies, we will expand our use of “dual-use” technologies and collaborate with a wider range of technology partners. We are also enhancing our training infrastructure to maintain the SAF’s edge. Phase 1 of SAFTI City will be operationalised from 2024 to support training in complex urban environments. By the end of this year, the SAF’s new Instrumented Battle Circuits will provide more realistic training under simulated artillery bombardment and air strikes, allowing our soldiers to hone operational instincts and tactical fundamentals. Our investments in overseas facilities such as the Shoalwater Bay Training Area in Australia will allow the SAF to conduct large-scale exercises that cannot be replicated locally. Even as it enhances training effectiveness, the SAF will not compromise on the safety of our servicemen. The SAF’s adoption of an enterprise Safety Information System will enable important safety reminders and lessons to reach its service personnel quickly. Through the newly launched Heat Resilience and Performance Centre, we will conduct research to better prevent heat injury and boost our soldiers’ resilience against heat stress amid rising global temperatures. NS is the bedrock of Singapore’s defence. We will continue to strengthen the NS system. We will maximise the contributions of our national servicemen by reviewing our medical classification system, expanding work-learn schemes for our Full-Time National Servicemen, and redesigning vocational roles. Operationally Ready National Servicemen will also see expanded opportunities to apply their civilian expertise in operational contexts. We will also improve the NS experience, by reviewing policies and procedures and deploying technology to make NS processes and services more efficient and convenient, so that national servicemen can focus on training to remain operationally ready. We will also continue to enhance support and recognition for our national servicemen. As a small nation state, we must uphold a global order and regional security architecture that is based on openness, inclusivity, and adherence to international law and norms. We will build trust, facilitate constructive dialogue, and encourage practical cooperation through multilateral platforms including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Defence Ministers’ Meeting (ADMM) and ADMM-Plus, Shangri-La Dialogue, and Singapore Defence Technology Summit. We have launched the ADMM Cybersecurity and Information Centre of Excellence to promote research and information sharing on emerging cybersecurity and information threats. Bilaterally, we will continue to strengthen defence relations with our neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia. We will also expand cooperation with partners such as Australia, China, India, and the United States, through high-level dialogue, military-to-military exchanges, and joint training.Every Singaporean has a part to play in keeping our home peaceful, safe, and secure. We will pursue new ways to encourage Singaporeans to participate actively in Total Defence. Building on the 2023 Total Defence Community Exercise, we will partner more communities to enhance individual and collective emergency preparedness and resilience in the face of potential crises. We will encourage more ground-up initiatives from Singaporeans to put Total Defence into action. Our defence and military museums are being revamped, and a new NS Gallery will open by 2027 to bring our defence story to life for Singaporeans.By working together and remaining committed to the defence of our nation, we will continue to safeguard our security, sovereignty and way of life.\n",
      "The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan)\n",
      "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) upholds Singapore’s sovereignty, while advancing the interests of Singapore internationally and providing consular services to Singaporeans. Our mission remains constant, even as the world has become more complex and dangerous. Russia’s invasion of its neighbour Ukraine is a striking reminder that we must never take our independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity for granted.The rules-based multilateral order, which has underpinned global peace and prosperity, is under severe strain. Even as we emerge from the COVID-19 crisis, we see a perfect storm of multiple overlapping and interrelated crises in the security, economic, public health, climate, technological, and socio-political domains. Superpower rivalry between the United States (US) and China continues to sharpen, with increasing risks of mishaps and geopolitical miscalculations. To navigate this increasingly fractured global order while seizing new opportunities for Singaporeans, Singapore’s foreign policy must continue to be guided by our long-term national interests that are well understood and supported by our people.Our relations with our immediate neighbours remain important. We continue to work closely with them to deepen ties and expand cooperation in emerging areas. With Malaysia, the priority is to enhance our peoples’ lives and livelihoods through projects like the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System Link. At the same time, we will manage our differences pragmatically and constructively. Having ratified the agreements under the Expanded Framework between Singapore and Indonesia, we are exploring opportunities to collaborate on future-oriented issues with Indonesia, such as the digital economy, sustainable development, and human resource development, and the green economy including the energy transition. Singapore has also worked closely with Indonesia in the multilateral arena, including supporting its successful G20 Presidency last year, and its ASEAN Chairmanship this year to advance ASEAN integration. Singapore has a special and unique relationship with Brunei, with whom we are also expanding cooperation in education, the green economy, and supply chain resilience.MFA forges overlapping circles of friends as embodied in the open, inclusive, and ASEAN-centred regional architecture. The innermost circle comprises our immediate neighbours and ASEAN, which remains a cornerstone of our foreign policy. ASEAN-led mechanisms like the East Asia Summit, ASEAN Regional Forum, ASEAN Plus-Three, and the Plus-One summits bring all major powers and regional players, including the US, China, and India, to the same table. We welcome the interest of major powers to engage ASEAN on our own merits, and to take clear stakes in the peace, stability, and development of our region, which will create a stable balance of power in the Asia Pacific. Beyond our immediate neighbourhood, we work with other partners around the world to advance our shared interests and address common challenges. We continue to champion common causes with the other 107 members of the Forum of Small States. Our Singapore Cooperation Programme, which has seen the participation of close to 150,000 foreign officials, continues to evolve to meet the needs of fellow developing countries. For instance, we launched our new Sustainability Action Package to support developing countries’ priorities in sustainability and climate change.An inclusive and rules-based multilateral system is key to Singapore’s survival and prosperity as a small island city-state with unique vulnerabilities. We will continue to advocate adherence to, and strengthening of, multilateralism and international law. We will also continue making constructive contributions to emerging rules and norms governing the global commons, including in climate change and sustainability, cyberspace and outer space. For example, we have just successfully concluded negotiations under Singapore’s Presidency on a new United Nations Agreement on Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction. Amidst the pushback against globalisation and free trade, we must continue to press ahead with global economic integration and seize opportunities in emerging areas. Singapore has been working with like-minded partners such as Australia, Republic of Korea, United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Chile, on pathfinding initiatives, such as the modular and project-based Digital Economy Agreements and Green Economy Agreements. We encourage plurilateral initiatives, such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which facilitate trade cooperation and promote a forward-looking economic agenda.With the easing of COVID-19 travel restrictions worldwide, we expect greater demand for consular services as more Singaporeans resume travelling, and some may encounter problems or difficulties overseas. MFA will meet this increased demand and deliver consular services to all Singaporeans promptly and effectively, by harnessing technology as well as through a new corps of professional first responders trained to provide 24/7 consular response and assistance to Singaporeans. National unity is essential for Singapore’s survival. Heightened geopolitical tensions have exacerbated the risk of foreign interference in our public discourse and shaping of opinions on global and domestic policies. We will continue to engage fellow Singaporeans on our foreign policy principles, so that they have a clear-eyed understanding of Singapore’s long-term national interests and vulnerabilities. With understanding, trust, and support from our citizens, Singapore will be on a stronger footing to chart our own course and act in our best interests.Despite the fraught external environment, we have invaluable strengths, including our reputation for stability and policy consistency, as well as high levels of public trust and support — which we do not take for granted. We will continue to safeguard and shore up our resilience and unity as Singaporeans, in Singapore or overseas, to navigate the challenges and seize the opportunities ahead.\n",
      "The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam)\n",
      "The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and its Departments work as one Home Team to keep Singapore safe and secure. To fulfil our mission, we regularly update our laws, leverage technology extensively to enhance operational effectiveness, train and develop our officers for emerging challenges, and build partnerships with the public and international community.Singapore remains one of the safest countries in the world. In 2022, we were ranked first in Gallup’s Global Law and Order Report, for the seventh time since 2015. To continue keeping Singapore safe and secure, we need to address significant and emerging threats. First, terrorism continues to be a pressing and real threat. Second, criminal syndicates are making sophisticated use of technology to operate across national boundaries, resulting in notable increases in online scams and cybercrimes. Third, psychoactive substances and more liberal attitudes internationally towards drug use pose challenges to our efforts to keep Singapore drug-free. Furthermore, we must continue to safeguard Singapore’s social cohesion, in particular our racial and religious harmony, which has anchored our country’s peace and progress. We will update our laws to deal with emerging threats. We have consolidated gambling-related legislation under the Gambling Control Act, and formed the new Gambling Regulatory Authority, to enable a more holistic and coherent approach to gambling regulation. We have amended the Misuse of Drugs Act to introduce a new legislative framework for psychoactive substances.In the near term, we will introduce new legislation to better protect Singaporeans from online criminal activity, including scams and malicious cyber activity. We will strengthen the ability of our law enforcement agencies to deal with money mules who assist in the laundering of scam proceeds and to curb abuse of Singpass credentials to perpetrate scams. We will also introduce the Maintenance of Racial Harmony Act, to encourage moderation and tolerance among different racial groups, and to signal the overriding importance of racial harmony to Singapore. The Home Team will continue to leverage technology such as data analytics, robotics, and unmanned systems to increase operational effectiveness, reduce operational risks, and enable Home Team officers to focus on higher value tasks.The Immigration & Checkpoints Authority’s New Clearance Concept (NCC) automates passenger, conveyance, and cargo clearance. In the near future, all residents, long-term pass holders, and departing visitors will be able to clear immigration without needing to present their passport. NCC will leverage data analytics and artificial intelligence to enhance detection of anomalies and security-sensitive items in conveyance and cargo clearance.The Singapore Police Force (SPF) is planning to expand camera coverage across Singapore and leverage video analytics to enhance sense-making.The Singapore Prison Service (SPS) is trialling a first-of-its-kind system – Prison Automated Screening System (PASS) – to automate urine sample collection and testing. This improves efficiency and accuracy, and also requires fewer officers for supervision.SPF and the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) are already deploying unmanned systems in various operational settings. SPF uses robots to augment Police patrols and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for crowd management and search operations. SCDF has been enhancing its firefighting operations with its fleet of unmanned ground vehicles. We are also trialling UAVs which can be operated remotely from a central command and control centre. This way, SPF and SCDF commanders can receive visuals of the scene even before officers arrive, allowing them to better plan their response.Advancements in technology will change the way the Home Team operates. To prepare our officers for evolving job roles, we will continue to invest heavily in their training, particularly in the area of digital technologies. The Home Team Academy will strengthen the Home Team’s training and learning ecosystem, such as by further developing and deploying systems for effective and realistic simulation training. Home Team officers deal with stressful situations as part of their work. We will continue to strengthen resilience and stress management, and foster a culture of support for the mental health and well-being of officers in the Home Team.The spread of radical ideology online has fuelled the self-radicalisation threat in Singapore, especially for susceptible young individuals. Public vigilance and preparedness through the SGSecure movement continues to be a key pillar of our defence. We will continue to engage neighbourhoods, workplaces, and schools to sensitise, train and mobilise our community to play a part to prevent and deal with any terrorist attacks.A vigilant and discerning public is our best defence against scams. MHA has launched a new national anti-scam campaign to encourage the public to act against scams. We will launch a Scam Public Education Office to drive and expand our outreach and communication efforts.Our networks of volunteers and advocates are critical to amplifying the Home Team’s effectiveness. SCDF is enhancing the Community First Response framework through leveraging technology to improve response to cases via SCDF’s myResponder App, and will be installing fire extinguishers at HDB lift lobbies to equip the community to respond to minor fires. SPF has rolled out the Community Watch Scheme, which seeks to build an informed and vigilant community. The Central Narcotics Bureau, together with the National Council Against Drug Abuse, has broadened its community outreach through collaborations with various organisations and enhanced training for volunteers and advocates under the A3 (Anti-Drug Abuse Advocacy) Network.SPS and Yellow Ribbon Singapore (YRSG) will better support the rehabilitation and reintegration of ex-offenders by expanding collaborations with community partners to help ex-offenders through training and employment assistance. To enhance ex-offenders’ career prospects, YRSG has shifted from a training and job placement model to one that emphasises skills for long-term career development, through career coaching, partnerships with stakeholders, and enhanced access to career resources.Given the rising volume and complexity of transnational crimes and security threats, including scams and terrorism, it is imperative we work more closely with the international community. We will strengthen our bilateral relationships, and work constructively with and through multilateral organisations such as the International Criminal Police Organisation (INTERPOL), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the United Nations. With the support of Singaporeans, the Home Team will strive to keep Singapore a safe and secure home for all.\n",
      "The Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien)\n",
      "Sustainability has always been part of Singapore’s development journey as we set out to create a clean, green, and liveable environment amid Singapore’s urban transformation. Through the Singapore Green Plan 2030, we renewed our commitment to put sustainability and resilience at the heart of our plans, to build a future-ready Singapore that continues to thrive in a world characterised by climate change, resource constraints, and growing uncertainties. The Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) will continue working with Singaporeans to steward a sustainable and resilient Singapore for future generations, in line with aspirations conveyed through the Forward Singapore exercise.The Singapore Green Plan charts out concrete policies and actions for Singapore to decarbonise and achieve our net-zero ambition, and how the Government, businesses, community, and individuals can work together towards a greener future. The Government will enable this green transition by working with all segments of society to change our mindsets, habits, and behaviours, and supporting the creation of new sustainable business models and green jobs.To accelerate our low-carbon transition, the carbon tax will be raised progressively from $5 per tonne now to $50 – $80 per tonne by 2030. To ensure an inclusive transition, we will continue supporting enterprises and households to become more energy-efficient and reduce their carbon footprint, through schemes like the Energy Efficiency Fund and Climate Friendly Households Programme. We will continue to advance effective international collaboration to support our decarbonisation efforts, such as in carbon markets, carbon capture usage and storage, a regional power grid, and renewable energy.Through GreenGov.SG, MSE will drive public sector efforts to achieve net-zero emissions around 2045, five years ahead of our national target. The Government will publish an annual GreenGov.SG report and Statutory Boards will disclose their environmental sustainability efforts, progress, and plans. The public sector will reduce its electricity and water consumption and waste generation, and further enhance its green procurement policies. Environmental stewardship means shifting away from a make-use-throw mindset, and embracing a circular economy and zero-waste culture. The Extended Producer Responsibility framework is an important enabler to encourage sustainable production upstream by requiring producers to be responsible for the collection and proper treatment of their products at end-of-life. Manufacturers and importers will need to reframe their thinking, redesign their business processes and products, and consider environmental externalities throughout the life cycle of their products.As a low-lying and densely built island nation, Singapore is vulnerable to rising sea levels and rising temperatures. To adapt to increased flood risk, we will continue to enhance the effectiveness of our drainage network, and put in place multi-functional adaptation infrastructure for Singapore’s coastlines. To preserve liveability amidst rising temperatures, the Government will expand our urban heat mitigation measures by increasing greenery and using cool paints. We will develop solutions collaboratively through public consultations and dialogue sessions.We will increase our food resilience by diversifying our food import sources and continuing to ramp up local food production capabilities and capacity to produce 30% of our nutritional needs by 2030. This includes increasing the adoption of productive technologies and sustainable farming practices, making better use of land and sea spaces for agriculture and aquaculture, and encouraging demand for local produce.Climate change will also raise the risk of vector-borne diseases like dengue and pose challenges to public health. We will continue to safeguard Singapore’s public health through vector control and risk surveillance. We will continue to pilot, evaluate and scale new innovative solutions, such as Project Wolbachia.We will invest in new capabilities to realise our sustainability ambitions and raise our national resilience. We have introduced or stepped-up research and development programmes in areas such as decarbonisation, agri-food production, urban heat mitigation, coastal protection, and vector control, in partnership with both local and foreign companies and Institutes of Higher Learning. We will test-bed and implement innovative technologies, such as solar panels on reservoirs, and synergistic waste-to-energy at the Tuas Nexus. These efforts will be supported and sustained by a pipeline of local talent. The Singapore Green Plan is supported by a growing movement of individuals, community groups and businesses wishing to build a more sustainable and resilient Singapore. Through Forward Singapore, the community, public, and private sectors have discussed how we can, as a society, foster a more sustainable way of life, and steward our environmental resources responsibly for future generations. For example, the Green Action for Communities movement brings together community leaders and residents to co-create and co-implement sustainability initiatives that impact their communities directly. We will also continue to support community-led environmental sustainability projects through the SG Eco Fund. Building a sustainable, resilient, and future-ready Singapore requires everyone to play a part. Our convictions must translate to tangible action. We must change our mindsets, lifestyles and habits to build a more resilient and sustainable Singapore.\n",
      "The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran)\n",
      "Our air, sea and land transport sectors have weathered the worst of the pandemic and emerged stronger, due to the close cooperation between the Government, workers, unions, and industry partners. In the next phase, the Ministry of Transport (MOT) will focus on gearing up for growth. We will enhance the competitiveness of our global aviation and maritime hubs by strengthening capabilities and sustainability efforts, and creating opportunities for our enterprises and people. We will build a sustainable, resilient and inclusive land transport system as part of a liveable city for Singaporeans. Changi Airport’s passenger traffic has recovered to about 80% of pre-COVID levels; passenger traffic is expected to recover fully by 2024. As our anticipated activities return, the Government will work with aviation stakeholders to build up Changi Airport’s operational capacity ahead of demand, and readiness to deal with new threats. Singapore’s maritime hub stayed resilient and performed well through the pandemic, maintaining our position as the world’s busiest transhipment hub. We must build on our strengths to respond adroitly to changes in the global economic landscape and disruptions to supply chains. The Government has planned major expansions in our aviation and maritime infrastructure over the next two decades. We have restarted the Changi Airport Terminal 5 (T5) project, which is targeted to be operational in the mid-2030s. MOT is working with the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore and Changi Airport Group to update the design of T5 to be pandemic-resilient, with greater modularity for flexibility in scaling operations. The new terminal will also be designed for sustainability with energy-efficient features. Tuas Port opened as planned despite the pandemic and is on track to be completed by the 2040s, with an annual handling capacity of 65 million twenty-foot equivalent units.Beyond upgrading our infrastructure, MOT will strengthen capabilities in the aviation and maritime sectors through digitalisation and other innovations. To build up our aviation and maritime workforce, we are collaborating with industry partners to reach out to more students, develop work-study programmes, and support job conversions and skills upgrading for mid-career workers. We will also invest in our people by redesigning jobs and deepening skillsets.Sustainability is central to the next phase of growth for our aviation and maritime hubs. Both sectors will contribute towards the national target to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. MOT will aim for all airside vehicles at Changi Airport to run on cleaner energy by 2040, and will require all new airside light vehicles, forklifts, and tractors to be electric from 2025 as part of the transition. We will also require all new harbour craft operating in our port waters to be fully electric, capable of using B100 biofuels or compatible with net-zero fuels such as hydrogen from 2030. MOT will also work with the aviation and maritime ecosystems to put the regulatory frameworks, pilots, incentives, and infrastructure in place to facilitate a smooth transition.On the global stage, MOT actively supports the efforts of the International Civil Aviation Organization and the International Maritime Organization to reduce emissions from international transport. We also work with partners to develop sustainable international aviation and maritime ecosystems, such as \"green lanes\" for flights powered by sustainable aviation fuels as well as green and digital shipping corridors.Public transport remains at the heart of our land transport system. Many participants in our Forward Singapore engagements recognised and appreciated the improvements to our public transport system over the last decade, which have made it more accessible, reliable, and inclusive. The Government will significantly expand our land transport network over the next decade. We are on course to expand our rail network by a further 100 kilometres; when completed, eight in ten homes will be within a ten-minute walk of an MRT station. Increasing the density of our rail network will make journeys more convenient for commuters, enhance the resilience of the overall system, and contribute significantly towards our net-zero emissions target by encouraging more people to opt for public transport over private vehicles. We must also ensure fiscal sustainability, as we invest in building a high-quality, world-class public transport system. Financing public transport is a shared responsibility across the Government, operators, and commuters. We are heartened that participants in our Forward Singapore engagements acknowledged the need for this, while emphasising the importance of affordable public transport fares, especially for the vulnerable and lower-income groups. The Public Transport Council is reviewing the fare adjustment formula and mechanism, to achieve equitable cost distribution across all stakeholders. MOT will further encourage the adoption of cleaner-energy vehicles through regulation, incentives, and infrastructure. We have established clear regulatory milestones: to disallow registration of diesel cars and taxis from 2025, and Internal Combustion Engine cars and taxis from 2030. We will review financial incentives to encourage the adoption of electric cars, and monitor related developments in other vehicle segments, such as motorcycles and goods vehicles. We have brought forward the island-wide deployment of Electric Vehicle (EV) chargers, and one in three public housing carparks will have EV charging points by the end of this year, with full coverage by 2025. We remain on track to deploy 60,000 charging points by 2030.A central theme that emerged from our Forward Singapore engagements was for our transport system to be more inclusive, especially for seniors and persons with disabilities. To make our streets more conducive for pedestrians, we will expand pedestrian-friendly initiatives, such as retrofitting lifts at pedestrian overhead bridges, providing covered linkways, and traffic-calming schemes such as Silver Zones and School Zones. We will work with local stakeholders to pilot Friendly Streets in five neighbourhoods, in areas near key amenities with high pedestrian flow. Features, such as wider footpaths, more greenery, barrier-free crossings and road markings, will inform road users that they are in a Friendly Streets zone. Where necessary, we will also implement more direct crossings for pedestrians and reduce waiting times for pedestrians at traffic crossings. Friendly Streets will complement the expansion of our network of cycling paths to about 1,300 kilometres by 2030. Every town will have cycling paths by 2024; these intra-town paths will aid first and last mile connectivity to the major public transport nodes and key amenities.We will drive the next bound of growth across our air, sea and land transport sectors. Together, we will continue to build a more resilient, sustainable and inclusive transport system for all Singaporeans.\n",
      "The Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security and Minister-in-charge of the National Security Coordination Secretariat (Mr Teo Chee Hean)\n",
      "Security and resilience are critical to Singapore’s continued survival and success. Even as we face established security threats, such as terrorism, foreign subversion and espionage, new risks are emerging, driven by trends, such as growing geopolitical contestation, climate change and accelerating digitalisation. These risks include disruptions in supply chains and resources, extreme weather events that jeopardise critical infrastructure and lives, and the rapid and widespread digital transmission of disinformation that can exploit fissures in our society. The National Security Coordination Secretariat (NSCS) works with government agencies to identify, assess, and address cross-cutting medium-term national security risks. NSCS focuses on risks where a whole-of-Government response is needed. These include growing security risks in the economic and social domains. Growing geopolitical contestation has made the global environment more uncertain and inhospitable, especially for a small country like Singapore. For example, the Russia-Ukraine conflict upended global supply chains and energy supplies, even as the world was still reeling from COVID-19 disruptions. NSCS will work with agencies to mitigate risks to the flow of essential supplies, and to strengthen our resilience against global supply disruptions. Climate change affects, among others, food, water, and energy supplies. It can also cause extreme weather events that knock out critical infrastructure and pose risk to lives. This risk is exacerbated by the interdependencies across our critical infrastructure and essential services. For example, disruptions to power can affect internet connectivity and trigger a cascading impact on services provided over the Internet. NSCS will work with government agencies to study these interdependencies and develop mitigation plans for such risks. Strengthening social resilience is critical for a diverse, multi-racial, and multi-religious country like Singapore. We must continue to strengthen our foundation of unity and trust in peace time, so that we will stay united as one Singapore in times of crisis.Accelerating digitalisation poses new and enhanced risks to our social resilience and cohesion. While digital connectivity benefits businesses and citizens, it can also make us more susceptible to foreign influence and misinformation. Opportunistic actors can leverage digital connectivity to exploit societal tensions and fault lines. NSCS will work with government agencies to develop strategies to address these risks and strengthen social resilience. As security risks become more multi-faceted and inter-linked, government agencies must build the capacity and capability to collectively address them. NSCS will support agencies’ capability development with resources and funding, including for national security research. Singapore must remain vigilant and proactive in tackling traditional and emerging risks to our security and resilience. NSCS will continue to work closely with other Ministries to maintain a coherent and co-ordinated Whole-of-Government approach to protect Singapore and Singaporeans.\n",
      "The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai)\n",
      "The Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth’s (MCCY) mission is to build a caring, cohesive and confident nation, where everyone feels they belong and is inspired to work towards a common future. Through the Forward Singapore exercise, Singaporeans came up with ideas to strengthen our solidarity and mutual responsibility as one united people. MCCY will partner Singaporeans to act on these ideas to build a better and stronger Singapore for all and generations to come.MCCY will continue to develop our arts, heritage, and sports facilities and programmes as common spaces for people to come together to build shared memories. The Peranakan Museum and Children’s Museum recently opened with refreshed and interactive exhibits that tell the Singapore story. Our festivals, such as the Singapore International Festival of Arts, Singapore Art Week, and Singapore Heritage Festival, bring Singaporeans together to celebrate our arts achievements and heritage. Singaporeans will enjoy greater access to world-class sports facilities and marquee sports, lifestyle and entertainment events with the Government taking over ownership of the Sports Hub and rejuvenating the Kallang Alive precinct. MCCY is committed to growing a vibrant arts, heritage, and sports sector, that reinforces our shared identity as Singaporeans, instils national pride and confidence in our achievements and people, and fosters an inclusive society where individuals’ skills and talent, especially in the arts and sports domains, are valued. We are unlocking new opportunities with the next iteration of Our SG Arts Plan and Our SG Heritage Plan. We are also updating the Disability Sports Master Plan to set out pathways for aspiring para-athletes, and to enable persons of different abilities to participate in sport. MCCY will continue to support artists and athletes, including through new and enhanced facilities, greater support for self-employed practitioners to grow and innovate, and uplifting sector capabilities. We must continue to build a deep reserve of social capital and trust and nurture the “gotong royong” spirit. MCCY will continue to facilitate opportunities for Singaporeans to donate or volunteer for causes they are passionate about, through platforms such as Youth Corps Singapore, Team Nila, and our network of SG Cares Volunteer Centres across 24 towns. Through partners like the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre (NVPC), Community Foundation of Singapore, and Singapore Kindness Movement, we will promote care for each other as an integral part of Singapore culture and everyday life. The People’s Association will increase opportunities for citizens to be involved in community service and improvement projects in their local neighbourhoods.Schools remain an important common space to develop cross-cultural understanding and friendships from an early age. Programmes, such as Strategic Partnership Co-Curricular Activities, allow students from different schools to participate in activities, such as athletics, water polo and ethnic dance. We are also topping up the accounts of ActiveSG members aged four to 12 years with an additional $100 of ActiveSG credits, so children can interact and bond outside of school. Across ages, our arts and sports programmes, such as the Children’s Season, Children’s Biennale, and Active Parents, encourage family bonding, while our Active Silver Hubs promote intergenerational bonding and help seniors stay active.Demographic and societal shifts require us to continually reforge the bonds of trust among our diverse communities. Together with community partners, such as our Self-Help Groups, MCCY will facilitate mutual support across ethnic communities to ensure that the fruits of growth and progress are shared by all. We have refreshed existing platforms such as our Racial and Religious Harmony Circles so that they remain relevant in fostering social harmony and enhanced the Community Dispute Management Framework to promote pro-social behaviour and good neighbourliness.MCCY will continue to build a resilient society where the Government and other stakeholders, including businesses, communities and individual Singaporeans, tackle challenges together. Businesses have a role to play in strengthening our social fabric. MCCY is supporting the NVPC and the Singapore Business Federation to grow the number of businesses that generate value for society at large. MCCY is also extending and enhancing the Corporate Volunteer Scheme (previously known as the Business and IPC Partnership Scheme) so businesses can continue to enjoy tax deductions when their employees volunteer at an Institution of a Public Character. Businesses can also contribute through mentoring. The Mentoring SG office has been set up to grow awareness of mentoring, match individuals and organisations to suitable mentoring opportunities, and build capabilities to grow the mentoring movement at the national level. Corporate bodies can step up to provide volunteer mentors or opportunities for their employees to be mentored.Every individual contributes to society in their roles as family member, citizen and worker. We encourage all Singaporeans to partner the Government in refreshing our social compact through the Forward Singapore exercise. In our engagements, many Singaporeans were enthusiastic about playing a bigger role in shaping our future, including by contributing ideas, shaping policy and participating in new forms of engagement and partnership. They also agreed that closer collaboration and partnership between the Government and other stakeholders in society was essential in the next phase of nation-building. MCCY, together with the rest of the Government, will offer opportunities for Singaporeans to co-develop policies and solutions on salient national-level issues through platforms, such as Citizens’ Panels and Alliances for Action (AfAs). At least 35 AfAs have been formed since 2019. We see healthy, sustained youth interest in policy making. MCCY will encourage more youths to engage in constructive civic discourse, take action to make change, and contribute to policy co-creation through platforms such as the Youth Circles and programmes such as the Youth Action Challenge. Somerset Belt will be a refreshed and vibrant precinct for youths, with youths, and by youths. Young people can lend their voices to shape Somerset Belt into a space to experiment in and call their own. We will continue to create new platforms to give our youth opportunities to shape Singapore.Through the Forward Singapore engagements, Singaporeans have shared that they care about deepening inclusiveness, promoting fairness and growing a culture of giving back. MCCY will rally and support Singaporeans in achieving these ideals and aspirations, to build a stronger and better society.\n",
      "The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong)\n",
      "The Ministry of Finance (MOF) seeks to advance the well-being and development of Singapore through sustainable and forward-looking fiscal policies. We aim to enable an innovative, resilient and efficient Government that delivers strong outcomes and value for money for Singaporeans. MOF will work with Government agencies to deploy resources in support of our national priorities, including initiatives being developed in the Forward Singapore exercise.We will allocate our resources in a prudent and responsible manner and continue to adjust our fiscal strategies to support the aspirations of present and future generations of Singaporeans. We will continue to steward our reserves as a crisis fund and an endowment fund, to take care of present and future generations. We will also continue to ensure good governance and accountability in the use of public funds.Our fiscal space is now tighter than before. Looking to the medium-term, we expect annual Government spending to increase to around 19% – 20% of GDP in Financial Year (FY)2026 – FY2030, and possibly exceed 20% of GDP by FY2030. The key drivers of growing expenditure are healthcare and social spending, such as moves to uplift lower-wage workers and strengthen early childhood education. To close the funding gap, MOF has taken steps to strengthen our revenue position at Budget 2022 and Budget 2023, so that rising Government spending can be balanced by total revenue in the coming years. We have also enhanced the progressivity of our system of taxes and transfers. Beyond what we have factored into our projections, the Government may need to spend more, for example, to enhance Singapore’s economic competitiveness, social inclusion and mobility, or national resilience. If this were to happen, we would require more revenue, or a reallocation of existing funds to the new priority areas. MOF will continue to ensure sound and stable public finances for Singapore, through a sustainable mix of taxes on income, consumption and assets. We will uphold a fiscal system that is fair and progressive, where everyone contributes, but those who are better off will contribute more; where everyone benefits from Government spending, and those with greater needs will benefit more. MOF will also ensure that public sector manpower grows in a disciplined manner, to avoid taking up an out-sized share of the resident labour force at the expense of the private sector. As our resident labour force growth continues to slow, MOF will put in place additional measures to manage and reallocate limited manpower resources to meet future needs. MOF will continue with efforts to ensure good governance and enable a high-performing Government, to meet the needs and expectations of Singaporeans. MOF will work closely with Government agencies to ensure the effectiveness of Government spending. Our Government procurement will continue to be open and competitive, to achieve value-for-money and cost-effective outcomes. We will work with businesses, especially small-medium enterprises, to improve access to procurement opportunities, and to ensure a healthy pipeline of suppliers that are competitive, innovative and capable of meeting our future needs. MOF will work with Ministries to implement structured frameworks for programme evaluation and strengthen evaluation capabilities in support of better decision-making and resource allocation. This will be accompanied by efforts in enterprise risk management and internal audit to strengthen our system of governance. MOF will continue to publish the Singapore Public Sector Outcomes Review biennially.MOF will press on with digital transformation efforts. This includes integrating budgeting, procurement and payment systems for better whole-of-Government financial management. We will step up the use of data analytics to monitor resource utilisation, track spending outcomes and shape policy development. Digitalisation will also simplify Government processes and lower costs for businesses when they transact with the Government. Examples include the adoption of e-guarantees to replace paper guarantees, and direct e-invoice submissions through InvoiceNow to eliminate the need for manual processing.MOF will support public sector manpower capability development, by raising competencies in finance, procurement, internal audit, grants governance and the deployment of shared services. MOF will harness our fiscal resources prudently and responsibly, working closely with Government agencies and partners from the industry and community, so that we can move forward together with confidence and strength.\n",
      "The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam)\n",
      "Amidst intensifying geopolitical tensions and increased economic uncertainty, Singapore must maintain a high level of trust in our Rule of Law and our legal institutions. The Ministry of Law (MinLaw) will work closely with our partners, stakeholders and the public to strengthen our legal system, enhance access to justice, optimise the use of our limited land resources and support Singapore’s economic development. A strong Rule of Law is a fundamental pillar of a trusted government. We will press on with efforts to enhance trust and relevance, and improve accessibility of our legal system. We will proactively steward legal reforms to meet evolving societal needs, while ensuring that our processes are up-to-date, efficient, and effective, such as by becoming a Party to the Hague Service Convention, which can help Singapore litigants with the effective service abroad of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil and commercial matters. We will also uphold multilateralism and a rules-based international order by deepening engagements with international organisations. Singapore recently joined the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law, a leading intergovernmental organisation that develops international treaties and standards in commercial law.We passed the Courts (Civil and Criminal Justice) Reform Act 2021, which empowered the Courts to conduct remote, asynchronous and paper hearings in a flexible manner. This reduced the costs of litigation and improved convenience for Court users. In the area of family justice, we are working with key partners, such as the Ministry of Social and Family Development and the Family Justice Courts, to make family legal proceedings simpler and more efficient. These efforts aim to reduce acrimony in family proceedings, promote healing in family relationships, and safeguard the welfare of children. The establishment of the Public Defender’s Office (PDO) in end-2022, together with the expansion of coverage for criminal defence aid to the bottom 35% of households and covering most offences, was a significant milestone in our legal landscape. More Singaporeans and Permanent Residents can now have access to criminal defence aid. The decision to establish the PDO, which institutionalises public defence within the criminal justice system, was done after extensive consultations with the Law Society of Singapore and the Criminal Bar. We will continue to improve access to justice and legal services for all Singaporeans. We are working with the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth and the Ministry of National Development to enhance the Community Dispute Management Framework. We will be mandating mediation for certain types of disputes between neighbours and enhancing the effectiveness of proceedings in the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals. We will also continue to partner key stakeholders like Pro Bono SG on initiatives to improve access to justice, such as the set-up of a one-stop portal, for the public to access legal information. Singapore must continue to remain open to the world and find new ways to stay relevant and maintain trust. We are working with the Law Society of Singapore to explore industry-wide secondment and exchange programmes to provide our law practices and lawyers with opportunities to gain experience and expertise in growth domains and in key markets. To prepare our legal workforce for the future, the Steering Committee on the Reform of Legal Education and Training is reviewing the legal education and training required to develop our legal manpower. This will ensure that law students and lawyers continue to be well-equipped with the knowledge and skills they need for practice in the future economy. We will continue to strengthen Singapore’s position as a hub for legal and dispute resolution services, and harness the growth of the legal services sector across the world. We will build on our dispute resolution ecosystem and encourage foreign dispute resolution institutions to broaden and deepen their presence in Singapore. We will continue to establish and deepen relations with markets of interest, to capture opportunities for our Singapore institutions, law practices and lawyers. We will also build on the Singapore Convention Week and United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Academy to increase our mindshare and build connections to Singapore.We will also continue to build a forward-looking IP hub that creates value for the economy and provides good jobs for Singaporeans. To ensure that our IP regime remains relevant and continues to support innovative and creative enterprises, we have updated relevant IP legislation, such as the Copyright Act 2021 and the IP (Amendment) Act 2022. To support the development and use of Intangible Assets (IA) to create economic and business value, we will introduce the Intangibles Disclosure Framework to provide a consistent basis for businesses to disclose and communicate details of their intangibles and set up an enterprise-centric online platform to provide companies with better access to professional IA/IP services. We will continue to support law firms and lawyers’ efforts to leverage technology to improve the delivery of their services and better meet their stakeholders’ needs. We will further enhance the Legal Technology Platform to integrate it with public systems like eLitigation, LawNet, ACRA, and Sign with Singpass, and bring greater seamlessness to a lawyer’s day-to-day workflow.We will continue to maximise the potential and unlock the value of state properties, to meet Singapore’s social and economic objectives. We will pursue partnerships with stakeholders, experts and the public, such as the rejuvenation of Gillman Barracks, Yarrow Gardens, and Dempsey, to harness innovative ideas and business models and realise the potential value of our limited land and space.The Singapore Land Authority is developing the Digital Conveyancing Portal (DCP), following engagements with multiple stakeholders, including the Housing and Development Board, Urban Redevelopment Authority and other stakeholders involved in the conveyancing process, like real estate developers, conveyancing lawyers and law clerks. It aims to transform the current paper-based conveyancing process into a fully integrated and paperless one. We will continue engaging stakeholders and taking in feedback across the development phases to co-deliver a DCP that best meets the needs of the public and industry.MinLaw has been strengthening our legal system, developing our legal industry and improving access to justice. We will continue to engage our key stakeholders, strengthen the partnerships and trust built up over the years, and ensure that our policies remain relevant, to better realise our vision of \"A Trusted Legal System; A Trusted Singapore\".\n",
      "The Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service (Mr Chan Chun Sing)\n",
      "The Public Service Division is committed to advancing a Public Service that can always be trusted to deliver excellent service and a better future for Singapore, by building future-ready organisations, new and more agile capabilities, and a strong and diverse leadership with development opportunities for all our officers. We are reorganising our service delivery across different service delivery platforms, including physical centres, call centres and digital platforms, around citizens rather than only around agencies. We are also streamlining and redesigning regulatory processes to make it easier for businesses. We are organising information on GoBusiness so enterprises can access services and resources in an integrated and business-centred way. For example, first-time prospective business owners can now register their business through a step-by-step guided journey on the GoBusiness platform. In a fast-changing environment, the Public Service needs to develop a workforce that can learn, unlearn and relearn, so as to continue serving Singapore better. We are shifting our HR system so that it is anchored on competencies and skills, with more emphasis placed on competency development for officers, and with the use of competencies to guide how we recruit, reward and recognise officers. We are also instilling a mindset of continuous growth among public officers, to support their longer-term employability and contribution. We are concurrently helping officers build new skills and experiences throughout their careers, through training and development opportunities that take the form of structured job rotations, attachments to the private sector, cross-agency projects and short-term immersions with other Government agencies. This will ensure skills diversity and more career mobility for all public officers. The Public Service will also need to build capabilities in science, technology and engineering. The Public Service is reorganising itself to leverage Science and Technology (S&T) advancements to overcome manpower, fiscal, land and carbon constraints. The Science and Technology Policy and Plans Office coordinates the development of S&T capabilities across the Government in areas like robotics and automation, modelling and simulation, and low-carbon and sustainability solutions, with experts residing in Centres of Excellence that support technology adoption and demand aggregation in these areas across the Public Service. For example, the Land Transport Authority supports the public sector’s shift to clean energy vehicles; the Urban Redevelopment Authority supports urban operations and service delivery through urban modelling and simulation platforms.Strong leadership is critical to the Public Service’s effectiveness in an increasingly complex environment. We will continue to invest in developing our pipeline of leaders, ensuring that there is diversity of skills and experiences. We are diversifying our selection and sourcing process for scholarship holders and direct recruits, beyond traditional talent pools. We are also transforming our leadership development approaches to better prepare in-service leaders to lead their teams and organisations. These initiatives, which include the introduction of leadership competencies, 360-degree feedback exercises, job rotations and a stronger mentoring culture, are being extended to more leaders in the Public Service, including professional and specialist leaders and middle managers. Even as we reinvent, reorganise and reskill the Public Service to serve our people and nation better, the values and ethos of the Public Service must remain. The Public Service will continue to reinforce the sense of purpose in our officers and leaders, and maintain the trust of Singaporeans.\n",
      "The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Smart Nation and Cybersecurity (Mrs Josephine Teo)\n",
      "The Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG) aims to harness technology to secure opportunities for all, build trust and safety, and foster an inclusive Singapore community. We work closely with other Government agencies to ensure technology bolsters Singapore’s resilience and improves the lives of Singaporeans. Digital technology offers significant opportunities for businesses, people and Government agencies. SNDGG will enable all to seize these benefits through close partnerships with Government agencies, industries and research players, and with robust digital and cyber-physical infrastructure anchored by a strong Digital Government. First, SNDGG will leverage technology to facilitate the business activity, growth and innovation of Singapore-based enterprises. Together with the Ministry of Trade and Industry, we will enhance the one-stop GoBusiness digital platform to support firms’ day-to-day transactions and longer-term investments, such as in equipping workers with future skills. We will work with the Ministry of Communications and Information to support the digital economy through initiatives like the SG Financial Data Exchange. We will make it easier for businesses to tap on the expertise of public research players for innovation, such as through the JTC-Singapore Institute of Technology Living Lab testbed, and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)-Smart Nation and Digital Government Office Jurong Lake District Innovation Challenge.  Second, SNDGG will use technology to transform the lived experiences of citizens. We will improve the convenience of digital services and transactions through applications, such as Singpass and LifeSG. We will also drive advancements in Singapore’s cyber-physical infrastructure with URA, including scaling innovative solutions in estate management from Punggol Smart Town to other districts. Finally, SNDGG will refresh the Digital Government Blueprint in end-2023 and strive towards more discoverable, personalised and seamless Government services. We will work closely with ServiceSG to redesign whole-of-Government service delivery. This includes promoting the use of common digital platforms across Government and building up the Government’s data sharing and data usage architecture.  As more of our lives and Government services move to the digital space, it is essential to maintain trust in public institutions and secure the digital platforms hosting these services, so people feel safe and protected against scams. This will set Singapore apart from other world-leading digital hubs. First, SNDGG will roll out the CheckWho product in end-2023 to help the public verify the legitimacy of calls from public officers. Second, SNDGG will ensure that transactions on Government platforms are secure and resilient with tools to better detect phishing sites that pose as Government agency websites, and fraud analytics solutions for Singpass. We will also continue to move more eligible Government systems to Cloud to improve resilience, security monitoring and threat detection.  Finally, SNDGG will work with the community to bolster digital trust and safety. We will support the National Crime Prevention Council and the Singapore Police Force to foster a culture of vigilance and contribution to scam prevention through applications like ScamShield.  Even as SNDGG aims to enable Singaporeans to reap economic benefits and productivity gains in the digital age, our fundamental aspiration is to build an inclusive, united and caring society that is “Digital First but not Digital-Only\". Together with ServiceSG, SNDGG will ensure that citizen services offered by public agencies remain accessible for less digitally adept Singaporeans, such as seniors and people with disabilities. Non-digital touchpoints and assistance will be made available to these groups of Singaporeans, wherever possible and necessary. SNDGG will also empower our people to use digital tools to participate fully in society. We will support efforts by MCI to promote digital skills and literacy in our people, such as the Digital for Life movement led by the Infocomm Media Development Authority, which galvanises the community to help citizens of all ages and from all walks of life embrace lifelong digital learning.  Digital technologies will empower Singapore to discover new opportunities and make our mark on the world. With our people, private and public sector partners, SNDGG is committed to building a Smart Nation where everyone has a place.\n",
      "The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister-in-charge of Strategy Group (Mr Lawrence Wong)\n",
      "The Strategy Group will continue to lead the Public Service to develop and implement strategic priorities, tackle long-term national challenges and build a better Singapore for all. We see fraying social compacts in many countries around the world, where people feel excluded from their nation’s progress and cannot find a common way forward on important national issues. This is why we are embarking on the Forward Singapore exercise – to bring Singaporeans together to examine our shared values and responsibilities towards one another, and to refresh our social compact. During our engagements, many shared their desire to build a fairer, more inclusive and more caring society. The Strategy Group will work with Government agencies to refresh our strategies and develop new policy responses, so that Singaporeans will have opportunities to progress throughout life, stronger assurances to tide over difficult times and a renewed sense of solidarity for the future. Beyond Forward Singapore, the Strategy Group will continue to strengthen whole-of-Government planning and execution to effectively tackle increasingly complex and cross-cutting challenges. These include a fragmented global order amid rising geopolitical tensions, new challenges brought about by technology, and the ongoing need to help Singaporeans cope with greater disruption and change. In response to this rapidly changing environment, the Strategy Group will review and refresh Singapore’s medium- to long-term national priorities, and work with Government agencies to strengthen the resilience of our economy, society and nation. Amidst growing resource constraints, we will also support agencies by centrally developing capabilities and coordinating structures across the Public Service. We will organise cross-agency work on policy development and implementation, to better manage trade-offs and achieve our desired outcomes across both economic and social domains. Like other advanced economies, Singapore faces a declining total fertility rate and an ageing population. Our local workforce growth will continue to slow. Caregiving needs will intensify as family sizes shrink and more Singaporeans face dual pressures of raising young children while caring for their elderly parents. Our society is also becoming more diverse and our multicultural identify will continue to evolve. We will update our population strategies to tackle these challenges. First, we will do more to harness longevity as a strength, so that individuals can reap the benefits of longer and healthier lives. Second, the Government will continue to carefully manage our foreign worker and immigration flows, to ensure that these translate to tangible benefits for Singaporeans, and to help newcomers integrate better into our society. Third, we will strengthen efforts to build a society where families matter and are well supported.We will do more to support the marriage and parenthood aspirations of Singaporeans. The Government has announced a package of pro-family measures at Budget 2023. The Strategy Group will continue to review and update our policies, including ways to extend more help to parents caring for their infants, and to those seeking to better manage their work and family commitments.Beyond Government measures, the whole of society has to come together to develop an environment that supports families and values family well-being. The Government will continue to work with the community, employers and other stakeholders to build a Singapore Made For Families.Amid the rising urgency to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, we will push ahead with efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change. All stakeholders must work together as we transition to a more resilient and sustainable society.Last year, Singapore raised our national climate target – to reduce our emissions to around 60 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030, after peaking our emissions earlier, and to get to net-zero emissions by 2050. To achieve these targets, the Government plans to raise the carbon tax to a range of $50 to $80 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030. We will diversify our energy mix with greener alternatives, such as hydrogen and regional renewable energy. We will work with industry and other stakeholders to research, develop and deploy low-carbon climate technologies, such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage. We will build a pipeline of high-quality carbon credit projects to help meet our climate goals. We will also support Singapore’s industries to embrace green opportunities and develop a workforce ready for the green economy of the future.At the same time, we must be prepared for the worst. The Strategy Group is concurrently working with Government agencies to prepare Singapore for the effects of global warming, such as rising sea levels and temperatures, and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events. The Government will also continue to participate actively at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and other international platforms to help shape the global climate regime, build partnerships and share expertise and climate solutions with the international community.The Government’s ability to think ahead and plan for the long term is key in ensuring Singapore’s continued survival and success. We will continue to strengthen forward planning capabilities across the Government. We will work with Singaporeans to achieve a better Singapore that will endure and thrive for generations to come.\n"

      "Mr Chairman, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head M of the Estimates be reduced by $100\". Sir, let me start by commending the Ministry of Finance (MOF) for publishing the Occasional Paper on the Medium-Term Fiscal projections; and releasing it just before the Budget debate. This paper provides a useful forward view on the likely fiscal trends in the next decade, as we debate Budget 2023 and our longer-term positioning in the new era.It is clear from the Paper that both our operating and development expenditures are rising, and may rise sharply in the years ahead. We look set to be heading towards a recurring spending bill of about 20% of our GDP by 2030. The key drivers are expected: healthcare, wage subsidies, security and other social spending.We know that these spending, once introduced, can only grow bigger and are unlikely to be reversed. Cutting costs to balance a Budget is increasingly not a possible option. We need to expand and diversify our revenue sources, and hence, growing our economy and growing our reserves for the annuities to help fund the Budget is an imperative. While we cannot cut costs to greatness, we should do our level best to ensure public funds are well spent, spend effectively and are achieving the desired outcomes.Given this backdrop, I would like to hear from the Minister, how MOF intends to maintain fiscal sustainability, even as our spending needs continue grow? Sir, as our fiscal situation tightened up, it is even more important that MOF scrutinise and ensure that our spending is value-for-money, that cost avoidance procurement practices are adopted, and that we closely monitor and track the outcomes and key performance indexes (KPIs).In the Budget Statement debate, I expressed concerns about cost pressures faced by businesses and the need to step-up the overall productivity. Many companies transact and do businesses with the Government and the way the Government agencies conduct its operations, and the processes involved, can have a significant impact on cost to the businesses.While we must be digitally inclusive when dealing with individuals; especially the seniors, we can aim for greater digital pervasiveness when doing businesses with the enterprises. There must be continued obsession to improve processes and users' experience; whether through greater digital adoptions or process streamlining.In this regard, I would like to ask if MOF has any plans to make doing businesses with Government even more seamless, less time consuming and lower the costs? The Government is a major buyer of goods and services, and many SMEs and start-ups have innovative solutions and product offerings that can be of value to the Government. So, I would like to also ask, how can MOF and the public agencies better support and facilitate the growth of SMEs when they participate in Government procurements?Sir, Singapore is transiting to a low-carbon economy and the public sector has set itself a net-zero emissions target by around 2045. This is a laudable effort and a major undertaking for the Government. Can I ask the Ministry: how is MOF supporting the whole-of-Government in this effort?The Government and MOF can also play a significant role helping businesses build green capabilities and capture growth opportunities, given the buying power of the public sector. So, can I seek an update from Minister in this area?Sir, one other area that I hope that the Government can facilitate to do more is the development of the social sector. The Government can be a catalyst to spur more innovative social solutions and contribute to a stronger social compact. So may I ask the Minister: how is MOF is supporting the development of the social sector?And finally, in this Committee of Supply (COS), can I also seek an update on the various policy measures in place, to encourage philanthropy and volunteerism?Sir, as I have two more minutes, I just want to add my views to the discussion on the budgetary stance for Budget 2023. Earlier in the debate, Assoc Prof Jamus Lim commented that the fiscal stance for Budget 2023 is a contractionary one. I have a different view. The fact that we have a significant Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) contribution to our Budget every year, currently at 20% of our revenue, would mean that our Budget would necessarily be expansionary. Our expenditures are way higher than the taxes that we collect from the system. Hence, from that angle, our Budget will always be expansionary if we rely on NIRC to balance our books.Question proposed.Mr Chairman: Mr Leong Mun Wai, you can take your two cuts together please.\n",

      "Mr Chairman, I have questions for the Minister of Finance. Firstly, the termination payment for the Sports Hub was advanced from the Contingencies Fund and this House is now being asked to vote on replacing the amount in a Supplementary Supply Bill, how much is this termination payment? The Contingencies Fund was created for urgent and unforeseen expenditure. Was the termination payment for the Sports Hub so urgent, that it had to be advanced from the Contingencies Fund and not paid out of the Budget 2023?Secondly, where and when were the $900 million for SPH Media Trust be accounted for?Three, are there financial projections available, to determine the amount or transfer to the endowment and trust funds, and is the actual spending from the funds included in the Budget, in the year when the spending was made or is it off-balance sheet of the Budget?Fourth, when will the financial report on the $72 billion COVID-19 expenditure be completed?Fifth, based on what is given in the Budget, can the Minister confirm, what are the total financial assets as of 31 March 2022 and what is the net investment return (NIR) estimated for fiscal year 2023?Mr Chairman, the People's Action Party (PAP) Government and some of its MPs like to invoke the claim of raiding of the reserves to attack alternative policy ideas and proposals put up by the Opposition. In order to have a more productive debate in this House, it will be helpful to have an understanding of what constitutes \"raiding of reserves\". I would like to suggest two criteria to assess any new proposal that might affect the reserves.Firstly, the amount of expenditure required for the new proposal, relative to the size of the reserves and NIR. And secondly, the purpose of the expenditure, any proposal that passes these two criteria, where the amount involved is small relative to the reserves, or even the NIR, and serves an important purpose, should not be accused of raiding the reserves.Let me illustrate the two criteria using the Affordable Homes Scheme, which the Progress Singapore Party (PSP) recommended during the recent public housing Motion on 7 February 2023. During the debate, I explained that the Affordable Homes Scheme will only defer the accumulation of reserves, because the deferred land cost will be collected when the flat is sold in the future.And even if, the whole deferred land cost of about $3 billion per year is not collectable, it is only 6.4% of NIR and 12.8% of NIRC. We do not even need to use our reserves, so we have passed criteria one comfortably.For criteria two, the money is to be spent on an important and noble purpose, which is to make the Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat affordable and accessible for every Singaporean, of each generation. It will allow Singaporeans to retire comfortably, without having to sell his flat or downgrade. The financial security accorded is expected to unleash the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit in Singaporeans, and you would be able to better compete with the rest of the world. So, we also passed criteria two.Hence, based on the two criteria above, the affordable home scheme is an example of an alternative policy that does not constitute a raiding of reserves according to my definition. I hope to hear from the Minister what does she think. In the future, from my point of view, if the Government makes such accusations again, I will call them baseless allegations. Singaporeans deserve better for country, for people.\n",

      "Mr Chairman, my cut today refers to my exchange with Minister Indranee Rajah during the debate on the Carbon Pricing (Amendment) Bill.In the exchange, I was told the Presidential approval had not been obtained on my proposed amendments. I asked the Government when these amendments had been referred to the President to obtain the decision to which Minister Indranee Rajah made this reply and I am quoting a little from the longest speech she made in the interest of time, \"We determine that my amendments could not be supported, the reasons explained earlier by my colleagues and, as the amendments could not be supported, they will not put forward to the President for the President's recommendation.\"From this, it would seem that the exercise of the President's power to approve legislation that has fiscal implications has to be according to the Cabinet's advice. It would also seem that the Government can and does deem the President's approval to have been given or not given without necessarily referring the matter to the President.As I understand the statement, she did say that the President's approval or non-approval could be, to all practical intents and purposes, deemed to have been given by the Cabinet. And it did say that that particular matter had not been referred to the President.So, my questions here are two-fold.Firstly, in cases where the President has a constitutional duty to say \"yes\" or \"no\" to certain matters such as legislation with fiscal implications and when her decision can be deemed to have been given one way or the other by the Cabinet, is the matter referred to the President, the CPA and the other staff in the office of the President for at least discussion or information prior to the Cabinet's decision?And secondly, and much more importantly, what is the rationale for having such provisions in the Constitution whereby the Cabinet can deem the President to have said \"yes\" or \"no\" on certain matters and, hence, decide by itself?The role of the President in this regard does not seem to serve any check or balance function. What function then does it serve?One asks oneself what possible purpose could be served by such a procedural requirement baked into the Constitution. I can see no benefit to the body politic. In fact, I see a downside.Making it known that the President's approval is deemed by the Cabinet in certain domains as happened in November last year does not serve to enhance the prestige and standing of the Office of the President in the eyes of the public.In fact, to the contrary, this practice of \"deemed approval\" risks being seen by the public as involving the Office of President in a rubber-stamping or box-ticking exercise. It serves no constructive purpose and undermines the standing of the President. If there is no real reason for such provisions, will the Government do away with these provisions at some point in the future, given that there are no upsides but only downsides? Unless there are some upsides I cannot fathom right now and which the Government can explain.The Chairman: Mr Saktiandi Supaat, you can take both your cuts together.\n",

      "Mr Chairman, our success in weathering the recent COVID-19 pandemic came down largely to our ability to utilise our deep financial reserves, which have been accumulated by the Government who has spent public monies responsibly and prudently. In refining our checks on public spending, we must be cautious not to add further unnecessary or disproportionate bureaucracy as this will erode whatever savings we achieve from public procurement. For example, while I agree there is still room to invest in automated systems and training to eliminate human error, adding another one to two levels of approving authorities may be an inefficient and even ineffective solution.Whether under Emergency Procurement or normal procurement procedures, how does Ministry of Finance (MOF) ensure that public spending is scrutinised adequately to enable cost savings and what efforts are being undertaken to ensure prudent spending at all levels across the Government? How are larger projects, for example, like infrastructure spending being monitored?Mr Chairman, the public sector is a major buyer of goods and services. Set up in June 2000, GeBIZ was ahead of its time and was followed by many other e-procurement systems in other countries aimed at enhancing transparent competition and lowering the barriers for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to pitch for valuable Government contracts.  We should not rest on our laurels. How can GeBIZ be further augmented to help businesses save time and money in their transactions with Government agencies? For example, we can explore adding new features to integrate any industry briefings, tender briefings or site show-rounds with the relevant tender opportunities; and to engage with the procurement agency regarding any tender clarifications. Besides ensuring that the public sector obtains the best value-for-money, public procurement can serve the role of supporting the growth of promising SMEs and startups who have innovative solutions. In line with our strategy of supply diversification for resilience, can MOF’s \"value-for-money\" metric accommodate this aim? And what else can MOF do to help support the growth of promising SMEs through Government procurement?\n",

      "Mr Chairman, Sir, SMEs make up 99% of all businesses in Singapore's economy, employing nearly seven out of 10 workers and contributing close to half of our GDP. We should look for ways to further grow SMEs to large local enterprises (LLEs) to increase their scale and per capita contribution to our economy.Accordingly, I call upon MOF to facilitate more procurement opportunities for SMEs. What can MOF do to help support the growth of promising SMEs through Government procurements? In 2021, more than 80% of the procurement opportunities were open to SMEs. How can we further ensure that more such opportunities are made available for SMEs?Currently, a gap exists in contract value threshold for a request for quotations and tender. Also, can the Government review financial grading requirements for certain types of products and services to crowd source more innovative solutions? Some of these solutions can be provided by startups who may not meet the required financial grading due to the stage of their companies' growth. By doing so, the Government can tap on new innovations.An “in-between” or middle ground can exist, where there is a “tender-lite system” which can provide SMEs and startups procure opportunities more readily. Tenders do take significant time and resources for SMEs and startups which translates to opportunity costs.In relation to the point on opportunity costs, can the Government streamline its processes to help businesses save time and money in their transactions with Government agencies? Can these digital solutions and innovations in turn encourage more efficient ways of doing business between companies and their suppliers and customers?Mr Chairman, Sir, increasing access to public sector contracts and reducing cost and time to transact with Government at the tender and operational stages can significantly help grow our SMEs and startups.\n",

      "Sir, like many in this House, I was cheered when Singapore brought forward its Singapore's NDCs to reach net zero by 2050, and for the public sector to achieve net-zero emissions by around 2045.  This is a significant commitment and a non-trivial one to achieve, especially in the midst of an energy crisis. Many decarbonisation technologies are already ready today, but the speed of rollout depends on various other factors like infrastructure upgrades, business model and regulatory changes. EVs come to mind here. While other decarbonisation technologies, especially in hard to abate sectors of the economy, are not yet available at scale today. Until technologies like green hydrogen or CCUS become cost competitive versus carbon intensive alternatives, it will be difficult to mobilise the capital needed to scale and bring them down the cost curve over time. Governments must play their part to incentivise the flow of investment into these climate solutions, and the transition to these solutions given their cost disadvantage. By giving incentives to reduce the “green premium”, and through innovative risk sharing and financing structures, including public-private partnerships, Government can be the catalyst for a faster transition. Some governments have made bolder policy moves. The US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of August 2022 has been billed as the largest piece of federal legislation to address climate change. Investing $391 billion in provisions related to energy security and climate change, including tax incentives and a green bank. The tax credits of $3 per kg of hydrogen is particularly notable, turning the US into one of the cheapest countries in the world to produce green hydrogen.  In Singapore the Government has many fiscal and non-tax levers to drive the transition which it has used, such as carbon tax, and funding for research. Given recent developments, can the Minister provide an update on how MOF is supporting the transition to net zero?\n",

      "Chairman, we anticipate a tighter fiscal space in the coming years. There is scope for wealthy families, businesses and individuals to contribute meaningfully through philanthropy to our rising needs. Unlike a conventional system that relies heavily on taxation and redistribution, philanthropy offers the added benefit of strengthening our social compact.  The number of wealth owners and family offices in Singapore continues to grow at a healthy rate. Many of them have expressed interest to give back to society, both in Singapore and regionally. The Philanthropy Tax Incentive Scheme announced in Budget 2023 for Family Offices is another important step to facilitate philanthropy and to meet Singapore’s ambition to be Asia's philanthropic hub.   As we encourage philanthropy to continue to grow, it is important to ask what types of philanthropy will have the greatest impact on Singapore.  Prof Rob Reich of Stanford University has argued that philanthropy has a special role in discovery and experimentation, serving as society’s \"risk capital\" to foster innovation in important areas that deemed to carry too much risk for Government or private sector appetites.   As such, philanthropy can be catalytic and complementary to public funding – it can identify and support high-impact opportunities that are in its early stage. When the solutions are proven, philanthropists can partner with the public sector to scale them up.   It is also important to identify the most pressing areas of need where philanthropy can have the greatest impact. Take climate change as an example – it is an existential imperative, and the negative effects of climate change will also exacerbate other areas of need, such as global health and pandemics, inequality and displacement of communities.   As a recent McKinsey climate philanthropy report has noted, philanthropists possess both resources and expertise to support climate mitigation and adaptation solutions, especially in areas that may lack market support.    They can quickly deploy unrestricted funds in response to urgent problems such as natural disasters, back high-risk ventures, convene stakeholders and promote collaboration, develop and share research, and support large-scale implementation of climate solutions. So, I want to ask how can the Government foster support and public-private partnerships, both in Singapore and overseas, for such philanthropic causes, to address some of society’s most pressing challenges and issues? In promoting philanthropy, we must also consider policies across the continuum of doing good, which is wide-ranging and can include venture philanthropy, concessionary capital and impact investing – a broad range continuum.  Many wealth owners, especially those in the next generation, are looking towards these newer and more innovative approaches, sometimes referred to as “moon-shot” philanthropy.   So, we must also recognise that beyond grant making, there are other ways to give back such as volunteerism and the contribution of skills and networks. As the Government develops more initiatives and policies to promote philanthropy, how can it promote more diverse ways of doing good?The Chairman: Senior Minister of State Chee Hong Tat.\n",

      "Mr Chairman, I thank Members for their questions and suggestions.Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked how the Government ensures fiscal sustainability and spend prudently within our means. Besides the audits by the Auditor-General’s Office and our internal auditors, MOF conducts regular reviews of Ministries’ budgets to identify areas for improvement and ensures every Ministry uses its allocated resources efficiently and effectively.Singapore’s overall performance has been good, with current Government expenditure being around 18% of GDP. Even as our expenditures grow further and exceed 20% of GDP by 2030, our Government expenditure as a percentage of GDP is significantly lower than most developed countries. At the same time, we are able to achieve positive economic and social outcomes for Singapore and Singaporeans.  One example is how we reduce the costs of major Government infrastructure projects by applying a stringent cost-effectiveness evaluation together with experts from the private sector and academia. In 2022, we achieved total cost avoidance of around $1 billion through this process. This $1 billion saved means we can put it to good use and meet our spending needs in other areas.The Government also looks out for other forms of savings by integrating different projects to maximise the synergies. For example, the upcoming East Coast Integrated Depot, which incorporates three MRT depots and one bus depot, saved about 44 hectares of land. This is twice the land size of Changi Airport’s Terminal 4 or equivalent to approximately 60 football fields.  Another example is VITAL’s Demand Aggregation contracts for common buys such as office supplies, catering and courier services. These saved the Government more than $50 million per annum. This approach also reduces the need for agencies to call separate tenders and quotations, saving at least 100,000 man-hours a year.  Sir, Mr Liang, Mr Edward Chia, Ms Mariam Jafaar and Mr Saktiandi asked how MOF helps businesses to reduce costs and build capabilities for growth. The Government will continue to implement pro-business policies and measures and provide an environment that enables them to grow and succeed. Besides supporting businesses through our economic agencies and via a comprehensive suite of grants and incentives for innovation, productivity improvements and skills-upgrading, there are two additional areas where MOF’s work benefit our companies. First, by simplifying Government rules and processes, we enable businesses to save time and money when they transact with Government. Second, by helping businesses build capabilities to enhance their competitiveness and access new opportunities, both locally and abroad.Let me share some examples.We recently launched eGuarantee@Gov, a simple and secure digital process for businesses and individuals to provide a banker’s guarantee or insurance bond to Government agencies. Businesses can apply for an eGuarantee from over 20 participating financial institutions online for direct submission to Government agencies within a day. With eGuarantee@Gov, there is no longer a need to visit a bank to purchase a physical copy of the guarantee or to pay for courier services to deliver it. The new arrangement is quicker, better and cheaper. We expect up to 4,000 eGuarantees to be lodged in 2023, resulting in overall savings for all stakeholders of about $500,000 per year. There is also scope in the future for eGuarantees to extend to commercial transactions between businesses and their suppliers and customers. MOF and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) will work with the financial institutions and trade association and chambers to encourage adoption of eGuarantees for such transactions. Just as the use of PayNow for digital payments has allowed businesses and individuals to enjoy lower transaction costs and time savings compared to the traditional method of using cheques, the adoption of eGuarantees can bring about benefits compared to the current method of providing physical bank guarantees.Next, MOF removed the requirement for businesses with annual turnover of less than $5 million to submit audited accounts when applying for Government Supplier Registration. This benefits about 2,400 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) annually, with estimated cost savings of around $4.5 million per year. MOF continually makes improvements to GeBIZ, the Government-wide procurement system. For instance, about 3,000 businesses can benefit from the Supplier File Repository by the end of this year. Businesses no longer need to submit the same financial statements and company profile when responding to different Government quotations and tenders. We will also consider the features that Mr Saktiandi mentioned for future improvements.Sir, another example is Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore’s (IRAS) initiative to encourage businesses to use seamless filing software. Such software provides many productivity benefits for businesses, as they can automatically generate and file their corporate income tax computations and returns. This process takes only 15 minutes compared to the estimated eight hours required for manual preparation and submission.Moving on to the next area of how MOF supports businesses to develop capabilities for growth. We will continue to simplify our processes for suppliers, including SMEs, to participate in Government tenders while maintaining a level-playing field for all businesses and achieving value-for-money procurement outcomes. For procurement below $90,000, financial track record is not required. The terms and conditions are also simplified. For example, there is no requirement to provide security deposits. SMEs participate actively in our Government contracts and about 80% of these are awarded to SMEs annually. Winning Government contracts gives SMEs the opportunity to build up their track records, develop capabilities and capacity to tap into new growth areas. To further improve the access of SMEs to business opportunities through Government tenders, MOF will introduce a new category of tender by the end of 2023 called “Tender Lite”, which comes with fewer and simpler conditions. Tender Lite will allow more suppliers to participate in tenders with value higher than $90,000 but below $1 million and is estimated to cover over 70% of all Government tenders that are currently awarded to SMEs.MOF will work with representatives from Singapore Business Federation and the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises, as well as Government agencies on the design of Tender Lite. We believe this approach of Government and industry working together as partners will bring about win-win outcomes and allow us to move faster and innovate new solutions more effectively. My colleagues and I are keen to continue the partnership with our industry partners beyond Tender Lite and extend the collaboration to other subsequent areas of work that will benefit our businesses.Members such as Mr Derrick Goh have highlighted during the Budget debate that Government can help prepare SMEs for new requirements and opportunities in environmental sustainability. We agree. The public sector is supporting our suppliers’ efforts to adopt greener practices which are increasingly in demand by other major buyers. Over the years, the Government has incorporated environmental sustainability requirements into our procurement such as requiring information and communication technology (ICT) equipment and air conditioners to meet energy efficiency standards. Our target is to include environmental sustainability requirements and evaluation criteria into all Government procurement within the next five years, in a manner that keeps pace with industry readiness and international developments. Starting from FY2024, for tenders of construction projects and ICT projects with minimum estimated procurement value of $50 million and $10 million respectively, we will set aside up to 5% of the evaluation points for sustainability-related considerations. The Government will further engage the industry stakeholders on the details of these measures. Another capability that is increasingly sought after is sustainability reporting. Businesses that can provide good sustainability-related information can gain competitive advantage, expand into markets and potentially access cheaper funds through green financing.To drive sustainability reporting efforts for the industry, Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) and the Singapore Exchange Regulation established the Sustainability Reporting Advisory Committee in June 2022. The Committee will embark on its public consultations later this year.Businesses also need to accelerate their pace of digitalisation, a point which Mr Liang made. The Government will implement InvoiceNow as the default e-invoice submission channel for all Government vendors within the next few years. Using InvoiceNow will help businesses improve efficiency and reduce cost, by eliminating the need for manual processing and it also reduces errors. Businesses transacting on InvoiceNow can save $8 per invoice compared to the manual process. InvoiceNow also facilitates the direct transmission of invoices in a structured and standardised digital format that is accepted internationally across finance systems, and this helps businesses access overseas markets more easily. Today, about 55,000 businesses have adopted InvoiceNow, supported by 200 service providers. I encourage more businesses to come on board.Sir, Mr Liang and Ms Foo Mee Har asked how MOF will support and encourage more philanthropy and volunteerism from corporations and the community. Philanthropy and volunteerism are key elements for building a strong social compact. There is something intangible and different in how we build up the character of our society, when people go beyond what they are required to contribute under our fair and progressive tax and benefits system, where everyone contributes something and those who are better off contribute more. Many Singaporeans and also foreigners and companies who are based here, have an interest in philanthropy and are keen to help others in society. We have been strengthening our ecosystem to encourage their contributions and participation to maximise the positive impact to our local communities. This is a good way to keep our society cohesive and strengthen our solidarity as one united people. Not only through taxation and redistribution which are done through policies and laws but also through philanthropy and volunteerism which come from willing hands and loving hearts.  MOF provides funding support for many community and ground-up programmes which contribute to the development of the social sector. There are many existing efforts by agencies working with intermediaries like the Community Foundation of Singapore and ComChest, as well as beneficiaries to link up donors with suitable charitable causes. I have also met wonderful people such as those from Utama and Majurity Trust, who started initiatives to help raise donations from high net worth individuals and corporations to fund worthy social causes like caring for vulnerable seniors and providing opportunities for children from lower-income families.  The Government provides broad-based support in the form of 250% tax deductions for qualifying donations to Institutions of a Public Character (IPCs) and the Corporate Volunteer Scheme (CVS) supports volunteerism efforts by businesses in IPCs. The Government also provides matching grants to encourage charitable giving. For example, we allocated a top-up of $100 million to the Tote Board’s Enhanced Fundraising Programme which in turn provides dollar-for-dollar matching on eligible donations received by charities.Sir, to build stronger social resilience, the Government will continue to encourage our community especially those who have done well to engage in sustained giving and volunteerism. Through such efforts, we will strengthen our social compact and build a more caring and inclusive Singapore. This will then provide the social cohesion and stability for us to pursue pro-growth policies and enlarge our economic pie, generate more opportunities and provide more resources that we can then use to invest in our collective future and support the vulnerable amongst us.In this way, we can strengthen our social compact and grow our economy at the same time. The two objectives will reinforce and support each other, allowing us to move forward while staying together. The Chairman: Minister Indranee Rajah. \n",

      "Mr Chairman, I will be responding to the cuts filed by Mr Leon Perera and Mr Leong Mun Wai. Mr Leon Perera asked about the processes for obtaining the President’s recommendation to move a Bill, or amendments to a Bill tabled in Parliament. Mr Chairman, under Article 59(2) of the Constitution, Bills or amendments with financial implications cannot be introduced or moved in this House without the President’s recommendation. This mechanism ensures that the Government of the day has the sole right and responsibility to initiate financial legislation and therefore financial legislation cannot proceed without the Government’s support.It is very important to understand in this context, that for the purposes of Article 59(2), when the President gives his or her recommendation, it is upon the advice of the Government and not at the discretion of the President.If the recommendation is provided, then it shows that the legislation or amendment has the Government's support. This is different from the other provisions of the Constitution where the President acts upon his or her discretion, for example, in relation to draws on past reserves or the appointment of certain key appointment holders.Where the requirement in Article 59(2) is triggered and the Government does not support the Bill or amendment, there is no need to seek or to advise the President not to provide the recommendation. It is sufficient to inform the House that the Bill or amendment does not have the President's recommendation in accordance with the Standing Orders. Where the Government supports the Bill or the amendment, the Government will seek the recommendation of the President and formally advise the President to provide such recommendation.This requirement for Government support before financial legislation can be passed is a standard arrangement of many Commonwealth parliamentary democracies, although the mechanisms may vary.In Singapore, it is done through the mechanism of the President's recommendation, as I have explained. In New Zealand, where a Bill or amendment \"would have more than a minor impact on the Government's fiscal aggregates if it became law\", the government may issue a \"Financial veto certificate\" to state that it does not concur with the Bill or amendment, in which event, such Bill or amendment cannot be passed. In Canada, this is done by requiring the royal recommendation, which may only be obtained by a Minister, to be conveyed to Parliament.While the mechanisms may vary from country to country, the principle underpinning them is the same. That is to say, a Bill or an amendment with financial implications cannot be passed if the government of the day does not support it, in recognition of the principle that responsibility for financial matters lies with the Government. So, earlier, when Mr Leon Perera talked about \"deeming\", there is no \"deeming\" involved. If the Government does not support the Bill or the amendment, the Government would not even need to put it to the President. But if the Government supports it, then the Government will put it to the President with the requisite advice and the recommendation would be signified in Parliament. Hence, the Council of Presidential Advisers (CPA) is also not engaged because this is not a discretionary function of the President. The President may consult the CPA for the discretionary functions.For a Government Bill falling within the scope of Article 59(2), the Minister giving notice of the introduction of the Bill must indicate whether the President's recommendation is required and when introducing the Bill at First Reading, must signify whether the recommendation has been obtained. This is provided for in Standing Order 67(1).Members may recall that a few days ago, I introduced the Supply Bill. When I introduced the Supply Bill, I signified to the Chamber that I had the President's recommendation.In the case of a private Member's Bill, the Minister for Finance has to inform the Speaker whether the President's recommendation is required under Article 59(2). If the Minister for Finance informs the Speaker that the President's recommendation is in fact required, then, before the Member can be called upon to move the Motion seeking leave to introduce this Bill under Standing Order 66(1), a Cabinet Minister must signify to Parliament whether the President's recommendation has been obtained.If no such recommendation has been obtained, the Speaker shall not allow the Motion for leave to introduce the Bill to be moved. The same procedure applies to amendments proposed to Bills. That is under Standing Order 74(3)(c). One more thing I should add, which is that if a Member intends to propose a Bill or amendments to a Bill, which make provision directly or indirectly for the list of financial matters listed in Article 59(2), he or she should inform the Ministry or Minister with oversight of the matters in the Bill or amendment as soon as possible and ideally no later than the time of filing the relevant notices with Parliament so that the relevant assessments and steps can be taken. If the Member is not sure whether the matters in the Bill or amendment are caught by the provisions of Article 59(2), then all the more so it would be advisable to inform the relevant Ministry or Minister early. That deals with Mr Perera's cut. I move on to Mr Leong Mun Wai's cuts.Sir, Mr Leong Mun Wai had a series of, I think, five questions. Mr Leong did not provide the indication of these beforehand. Normally in the gist of the Budget cuts, Members are asked to provide the gist. I also do send out a notice, generally, to ask people to provide the gist of their cuts because it will then enable us to respond in a more considered or fuller manner. With respect to the five questions which basically were given on the spot, I will give such replies as I can. If the Member has any other things, it will have to be taken up separately. Let me just run through very quickly.I think the first question was on the termination of the Sports Hub. I would say in response the reason for the termination of the Sports Hub was addressed in the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY)'s Ministerial Statement in August 2022.The reasons for the urgency and the use of the Contingency Fund was: first, the transaction was market sensitive; and second, it was an opportune time to develop the Kallang Alive precinct as the sports sector recovered from COVID-19. The termination sum will be paid in this financial year.For his second question on the SPH Media Trust, that is from the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI)'s annual budget from FY2022 to FY2026. However, no money has been disbursed as Minister Josephine Teo had said in Parliament. For his third question, disbursement figures from the Government statutory funds are in the Government Financial Statements. The disbursement figures for the funds under the Statutory Boards are included in their financial statements.For his fourth question, the audit of the full $72.3 billion will be completed by the end of FY2024. This was answered earlier this month by Senior Minister of State Chee in a response to a Parliamentary Question.For the fifth question, I think the answers there can be found in the Budget Book.Then, with regard to his last point about what is the definition of \"raiding the reserves\", Mr Chairman, it is not a term of art. Essentially, we have a framework on how the reserves are to be used. When the principal amount is taken or drawn down or when land is alienated and if it is not made good or put back, that is a draw on the reserves.It is a simple principle that we adhere to. The framework is clear. It is not necessary for me to go into a definitional argument. The reasons and the rationale of when you can have a draw on the reserves are clear. A pandemic would be a good reason – when you are facing potential catastrophe and you have to save the economy, you have to save people. That is something that is built into the current framework. The reserves can only be used with the agreement of the President.The Chairman: Mr Leong Mun Wai.\n",

      "Chairman, I thank the Minister for the reply. I have three questions. One is that given the kind of payments like the Sports Hub and also SPH Media Trust, where is a big payment to a third party, what is the procedure whereby the Parliament can come in and have oversight over such expenditure? Meaning, how far can the Government just approve the expenditure, just like that?For example, now, we have this SINGA Bill where infrastructural projects that are more than $4 billion require – when it goes through the SINGA Bill, then it comes to Parliament. But does it mean that if in the future, there is a project where we need to terminate the project and it is a $4 billion payout, the Government just makes the decision like that without Parliament scrutinising the numbers? That is one question.The second question is, to your best knowledge as the Second Minister for Finance, what is the percentage of the endowment funds that are being paid out every year – as a percentage of the outstanding assets that these endowment funds have at the moment? The third question, with regards to the raiding of reserves. Your question basically means – does it mean that as long as the Government has a set of rules, we cannot debate against that set of rules? In this case, it is a set of rules regarding reserves management and the recording of the reserves. You can always say that what you have proposed is not in line with our reserve management policies but we can still discuss about it. There is no need to say right from the beginning, that this is a raiding the reserves and it is not only one time, but many many times by many people and over the mass media and all that.The Chairman: Could we keep it concise so that others can ask their clarifications?\n",

      "I thank the Member for his clarifications. I think his first question is related to what authority does the Government have and what is the relationship with Parliament and the degree of oversight. I should start off with the first premise, which is that when the people elect the Government, it is to govern. It is to run the Government. Therefore, there are quite a large scope of things which is under the authority of the Government.The Government, obviously, has to be accountable. Hence, when the Government is accountable, it has to come back to Parliament for various things. But when it comes to Parliament, it is usually to scrutinise broad policy and not the day-to-day operational matters.So, the debate that we just had, for example, the Budget debate we call it the Budget debate but actually, people forget what it actually is. It is a Motion to ask this House to approve the Government's financial policy. You approve the financial policy, all those broad headings and the broad expenditure that is agreed to by Parliament, but the details of how that is to be spent if it is within the block budget, that is really within the Ministries' purview.But if it is thought, for example, that the Ministry has not done well in its expenditure, that can be queried in Parliament either through Parliamentary Questions, and we also have the Estimates Committee, which is a standing Parliamentary Select Committee which examines the Government's Budget and raises questions thereon. I think that is available to the Member as well. So, we have a whole series of checks and balances. You have got the Constitution, which sets the framework. The fiscal policy or financial policy is subject to Parliamentary approval and subject to debate. We have got the Estimates Committee. There is also the Public Accounts Committee. It is also subject to independent audits by the Auditor-General's Office (AGO). The Public Accounts Committee also examines the Government's accounts and the AGO's report and calls on the relevant agencies to explain particular issues or to take corrective actions.For the second question on the extent of funds paid out every year, since that is a very specific question requiring certain data, perhaps the Member can file a question on that. I do not have that offhand.The third question was, I think the Member put it this way – he said does it mean that if the Government has a set of rules, we cannot debate it because he said we can always say it is not in line. He also said that there was no need to say that it is raiding one time but all the time. Let me deal with the two separately.The first one – does it mean that we have a set of rules? The answer is yes. We do have a set of rules. Does it mean that you cannot debate the rules? No. If you want to change the reserves framework, by all means, you can debate that. You can suggest that it should be changed. But so long as the rules are in place and so long as what is proposed is not in conformance with those rules and is a draw on the reserves, then it means that it falls outside or breaches, if you like, or it is not in accordance with the rules.So, there are two things. You have a set of rules. And if you want to debate whether that should or should not be the rule, that is entirely up to that Member's prerogative. But if what you happen to be proposing does not fall within the rules, then the Government is entitled to say that it would be a draw or, put it in a slightly easier to understand form, it will be a raid on the reserves.And secondly, Mr Leong suggested that there is no need to say raiding the reserves, not one time but many, many times. The answer is that, if your proposals do actually intend to draw down the reserves not one time but many, many times, then, inevitably, it will draw the reaction that you are raiding not one time but many, many times. So, it all depends on your proposal. The Chairman: Mr Liang Eng Hwa.\n",

      "Sir, just want to come back to the question I raised in my cut which is whether the Government can do more to review our rules and procedures so that we can be more pro-business and help businesses save cost and save time.I often hear this feedback from the businesses. The pain point is always that the Government rules can be quite cumbersome and some are unnecessary and the procedures can be quite inefficient.

      "Mr Chairman, I thank Mr Liang for asking this very important question. The Government deals with quite a lot of businesses: in our capacity as regulator, when they are applying for licence, they need our permit to operate; or as a buyer, when we procure services and then they are our suppliers.In both instances, there is scope for us to continue to look for ways in which we can do better in our interactions with businesses especially smaller businesses, the SMEs, because they do not have a lot of resources. So, when we design our licensing framework, when we design our rules and procedures, we also want to make sure that they are able to comply with not too much difficulty.Sir, I want to highlight that this is not just an MOF effort. This is actually a whole-of-Government effort. And my colleagues from the other Government Ministries and agencies, have also been embarking on this initiative. One of the initiatives, Mr Liang is aware, is the Pro-Enterprise Panel under the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) where we regularly solicit feedback from businesses and from trade associations on where are some of the pain points and where are some of the areas for improvement.I recall, a few years ago, when I was with MTI, I shared an example of how we used business process, re-engineering and digital transformation to implement Go-Business licensing portal where we shortened the processing time for food-related businesses when they applied for licenses by up to 14 days and we cut down the number of forms that they need to submit. Previously, I think it was 14 altogether, more than 800 data fields. We did some consolidation and we reduced it to one form with fewer than 90 data fields, and we removed some of the duplicate licences and helped them to save on licensing fees. When you remove some of these, then they do not have to apply, do not have to pay.This is something we want to keep doing and it has to be a partnership with our businesses and our trade associations, because the Government may not know fully where are all the pain points and where are all the areas for improvement. But from the users' point of view, the businesses will know. That is why I mentioned in my speech earlier that I want to work closely with SBF and ASME, not just to improve on the tender processes by introducing Tender Lite, which is one of the ways to help businesses, but also on other pro-business initiatives.\n",

The hon Member Mr Liang had suggested earlier on and, if I heard correctly, that so long as we have a positive NIRC, then the Budget must necessarily be expansionary.May I first clarify that that was indeed what he said.And, if so, since the NIRC has been consistently positive, at least since 2008, would that mean that he believes that over the past decade and a half, that we have never run a contractionary fiscal stance? And I am wondering if the Minister of Finance or anyone from the Finance Ministry is willing to corroborate this characterisation.If what the Member meant was, so long as the sum of the NIRC and revenue is less than expenditure, then it is expansionary. I actually have no quarrel with that. But since the NIRC has, in fact, been positive, this would actually mean an even greater surplus over expenditure, which would mean an even more contractionary budget, contrary to an expansionary one.The Chairman: Mr Liang.\n",

      "Thank you, Chair. I have two clarifications for Senior Minister of State Chee, not on philanthropy because the question roughly is answered, but two clarifications regarding a debate brought up here.First, Senior Minister of State spoke about Government's effort to support businesses, especially SMEs. So, how we pay them is going to be important. I would like to ask, this has been brought up in previous speeches, what is Government's plan to try and pay the businesses transacts within 14 days? Is that achievable, that request from Nominated Member of Parliament Ms Janet Ang?The second clarification is, what is the targeted adoption rate for e-invoice for transaction with Government? The Senior Minister of State spoke about that just now. I want to ask what happens if some SMEs have not put in place the necessary infrastructure?

      "Mr Chairman, the current payment term for the Government to pay our suppliers is within 30 days. And this is a standard that I would say, is comparable, if not, better than some of the other governments and even private sector companies. But we will want to work towards, where possible, to shorten the payment period. Because, as the Member correctly pointed out, this will directly benefit our SMEs in terms of cashflow.I would want to caveat that a little bit by saying that it depends really on the nature of the contract. There are some that are more straightforward – the service has been provided, the product has been delivered, everything is okay, we can try and speed it up. But there are some that may require more evaluation because it is not so straightforward, or if the amounts are much bigger and we need to be careful, with due diligence, in order to ensure value for money and prudent spending.Rather than to have sort of a blanket yes or no, we will certainly aim to work towards where we can – for simpler, more straightforward contracts, smaller amounts, we try our best to go within 14 days. But larger amounts, more complex contracts, we may need to give the agencies a bit more time so that they also can safeguard the interests of public funds.The Chairman: Mr Leon Perera.\n",

I would like to thank Minister Indranee Rajah for her reply to my cut.I just have one clarification, and I appreciate her laying out the process for seeking the President's recommendation on Bills, with fiscal implications as well as speaking about areas of exercisable discretion and so on. Those points are well taken.My clarification is just about why there is a need to have this rather curious and complicated procedure, where for these matters, something is referred to the President, but then, the Cabinet instructs the President to act in a very prescriptive way and President has to act that way and then the Bill can move forward in Parliament.It does not seem to serve any constructive purpose, in terms of time and the administrative effort and efficiency. And moreover, would the Minister give some thought to the consideration I raised? There is a potential disamenity in keeping such arrangements in place which is that of the President being seen to be a part of this sort of procedure which involves box-ticking or rubber stamping. It could be seen that way. It does not really help the standing of the Office of the President and just seems unnecessary.Will the Government consider reforming this aspect of the Constitution to sort of do away with that procedural step.

It is a polite way of coming to Parliament to say that you need the Government's support. Many of the things which have its roots in parliamentary procedure from the Westminster model come from these – you could say, these courtesies of the past. The New Zealanders, as I described, are a little bit more direct about it. It is just a government \"veto certificate\". \"Nope\" and that is it. But we are doing it in a polite way.

      "Mr Chairman, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head M of the Estimates be reduced by $100\". Sir, let me start by commending the Ministry of Finance (MOF) for publishing the Occasional Paper on the Medium-Term Fiscal projections; and releasing it just before the Budget debate. This paper provides a useful forward view on the likely fiscal trends in the next decade, as we debate Budget 2023 and our longer-term positioning in the new era.It is clear from the Paper that both our operating and development expenditures are rising, and may rise sharply in the years ahead. We look set to be heading towards a recurring spending bill of about 20% of our GDP by 2030. The key drivers are expected: healthcare, wage subsidies, security and other social spending.We know that these spending, once introduced, can only grow bigger and are unlikely to be reversed. Cutting costs to balance a Budget is increasingly not a possible option. We need to expand and diversify our revenue sources, and hence, growing our economy and growing our reserves for the annuities to help fund the Budget is an imperative. While we cannot cut costs to greatness, we should do our level best to ensure public funds are well spent, spend effectively and are achieving the desired outcomes.Given this backdrop, I would like to hear from the Minister, how MOF intends to maintain fiscal sustainability, even as our spending needs continue grow? Sir, as our fiscal situation tightened up, it is even more important that MOF scrutinise and ensure that our spending is value-for-money, that cost avoidance procurement practices are adopted, and that we closely monitor and track the outcomes and key performance indexes (KPIs).In the Budget Statement debate, I expressed concerns about cost pressures faced by businesses and the need to step-up the overall productivity. Many companies transact and do businesses with the Government and the way the Government agencies conduct its operations, and the processes involved, can have a significant impact on cost to the businesses.While we must be digitally inclusive when dealing with individuals; especially the seniors, we can aim for greater digital pervasiveness when doing businesses with the enterprises. There must be continued obsession to improve processes and users' experience; whether through greater digital adoptions or process streamlining.In this regard, I would like to ask if MOF has any plans to make doing businesses with Government even more seamless, less time consuming and lower the costs? The Government is a major buyer of goods and services, and many SMEs and start-ups have innovative solutions and product offerings that can be of value to the Government. So, I would like to also ask, how can MOF and the public agencies better support and facilitate the growth of SMEs when they participate in Government procurements?Sir, Singapore is transiting to a low-carbon economy and the public sector has set itself a net-zero emissions target by around 2045. This is a laudable effort and a major undertaking for the Government. Can I ask the Ministry: how is MOF supporting the whole-of-Government in this effort?The Government and MOF can also play a significant role helping businesses build green capabilities and capture growth opportunities, given the buying power of the public sector. So, can I seek an update from Minister in this area?Sir, one other area that I hope that the Government can facilitate to do more is the development of the social sector. The Government can be a catalyst to spur more innovative social solutions and contribute to a stronger social compact. So may I ask the Minister: how is MOF is supporting the development of the social sector?And finally, in this Committee of Supply (COS), can I also seek an update on the various policy measures in place, to encourage philanthropy and volunteerism?Sir, as I have two more minutes, I just want to add my views to the discussion on the budgetary stance for Budget 2023. Earlier in the debate, Assoc Prof Jamus Lim commented that the fiscal stance for Budget 2023 is a contractionary one. I have a different view. The fact that we have a significant Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) contribution to our Budget every year, currently at 20% of our revenue, would mean that our Budget would necessarily be expansionary. Our expenditures are way higher than the taxes that we collect from the system. Hence, from that angle, our Budget will always be expansionary if we rely on NIRC to balance our books.Question proposed.Mr Chairman: Mr Leong Mun Wai, you can take your two cuts together please.\n",

      "Mr Chairman, I have questions for the Minister of Finance. Firstly, the termination payment for the Sports Hub was advanced from the Contingencies Fund and this House is now being asked to vote on replacing the amount in a Supplementary Supply Bill, how much is this termination payment? The Contingencies Fund was created for urgent and unforeseen expenditure. Was the termination payment for the Sports Hub so urgent, that it had to be advanced from the Contingencies Fund and not paid out of the Budget 2023?Secondly, where and when were the $900 million for SPH Media Trust be accounted for?Three, are there financial projections available, to determine the amount or transfer to the endowment and trust funds, and is the actual spending from the funds included in the Budget, in the year when the spending was made or is it off-balance sheet of the Budget?Fourth, when will the financial report on the $72 billion COVID-19 expenditure be completed?Fifth, based on what is given in the Budget, can the Minister confirm, what are the total financial assets as of 31 March 2022 and what is the net investment return (NIR) estimated for fiscal year 2023?Mr Chairman, the People's Action Party (PAP) Government and some of its MPs like to invoke the claim of raiding of the reserves to attack alternative policy ideas and proposals put up by the Opposition. In order to have a more productive debate in this House, it will be helpful to have an understanding of what constitutes \"raiding of reserves\". I would like to suggest two criteria to assess any new proposal that might affect the reserves.Firstly, the amount of expenditure required for the new proposal, relative to the size of the reserves and NIR. And secondly, the purpose of the expenditure, any proposal that passes these two criteria, where the amount involved is small relative to the reserves, or even the NIR, and serves an important purpose, should not be accused of raiding the reserves.Let me illustrate the two criteria using the Affordable Homes Scheme, which the Progress Singapore Party (PSP) recommended during the recent public housing Motion on 7 February 2023. During the debate, I explained that the Affordable Homes Scheme will only defer the accumulation of reserves, because the deferred land cost will be collected when the flat is sold in the future.And even if, the whole deferred land cost of about $3 billion per year is not collectable, it is only 6.4% of NIR and 12.8% of NIRC. We do not even need to use our reserves, so we have passed criteria one comfortably.For criteria two, the money is to be spent on an important and noble purpose, which is to make the Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat affordable and accessible for every Singaporean, of each generation. It will allow Singaporeans to retire comfortably, without having to sell his flat or downgrade. The financial security accorded is expected to unleash the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit in Singaporeans, and you would be able to better compete with the rest of the world. So, we also passed criteria two.Hence, based on the two criteria above, the affordable home scheme is an example of an alternative policy that does not constitute a raiding of reserves according to my definition. I hope to hear from the Minister what does she think. In the future, from my point of view, if the Government makes such accusations again, I will call them baseless allegations. Singaporeans deserve better for country, for people.\n",

      "Mr Chairman, my cut today refers to my exchange with Minister Indranee Rajah during the debate on the Carbon Pricing (Amendment) Bill.In the exchange, I was told the Presidential approval had not been obtained on my proposed amendments. I asked the Government when these amendments had been referred to the President to obtain the decision to which Minister Indranee Rajah made this reply and I am quoting a little from the longest speech she made in the interest of time, \"We determine that my amendments could not be supported, the reasons explained earlier by my colleagues and, as the amendments could not be supported, they will not put forward to the President for the President's recommendation.\"From this, it would seem that the exercise of the President's power to approve legislation that has fiscal implications has to be according to the Cabinet's advice. It would also seem that the Government can and does deem the President's approval to have been given or not given without necessarily referring the matter to the President.As I understand the statement, she did say that the President's approval or non-approval could be, to all practical intents and purposes, deemed to have been given by the Cabinet. And it did say that that particular matter had not been referred to the President.So, my questions here are two-fold.Firstly, in cases where the President has a constitutional duty to say \"yes\" or \"no\" to certain matters such as legislation with fiscal implications and when her decision can be deemed to have been given one way or the other by the Cabinet, is the matter referred to the President, the CPA and the other staff in the office of the President for at least discussion or information prior to the Cabinet's decision?And secondly, and much more importantly, what is the rationale for having such provisions in the Constitution whereby the Cabinet can deem the President to have said \"yes\" or \"no\" on certain matters and, hence, decide by itself?The role of the President in this regard does not seem to serve any check or balance function. What function then does it serve?One asks oneself what possible purpose could be served by such a procedural requirement baked into the Constitution. I can see no benefit to the body politic. In fact, I see a downside.Making it known that the President's approval is deemed by the Cabinet in certain domains as happened in November last year does not serve to enhance the prestige and standing of the Office of the President in the eyes of the public.In fact, to the contrary, this practice of \"deemed approval\" risks being seen by the public as involving the Office of President in a rubber-stamping or box-ticking exercise. It serves no constructive purpose and undermines the standing of the President. If there is no real reason for such provisions, will the Government do away with these provisions at some point in the future, given that there are no upsides but only downsides? Unless there are some upsides I cannot fathom right now and which the Government can explain.The Chairman: Mr Saktiandi Supaat, you can take both your cuts together.\n",

      "Mr Chairman, our success in weathering the recent COVID-19 pandemic came down largely to our ability to utilise our deep financial reserves, which have been accumulated by the Government who has spent public monies responsibly and prudently. In refining our checks on public spending, we must be cautious not to add further unnecessary or disproportionate bureaucracy as this will erode whatever savings we achieve from public procurement. For example, while I agree there is still room to invest in automated systems and training to eliminate human error, adding another one to two levels of approving authorities may be an inefficient and even ineffective solution.Whether under Emergency Procurement or normal procurement procedures, how does Ministry of Finance (MOF) ensure that public spending is scrutinised adequately to enable cost savings and what efforts are being undertaken to ensure prudent spending at all levels across the Government? How are larger projects, for example, like infrastructure spending being monitored?Mr Chairman, the public sector is a major buyer of goods and services. Set up in June 2000, GeBIZ was ahead of its time and was followed by many other e-procurement systems in other countries aimed at enhancing transparent competition and lowering the barriers for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to pitch for valuable Government contracts.  We should not rest on our laurels. How can GeBIZ be further augmented to help businesses save time and money in their transactions with Government agencies? For example, we can explore adding new features to integrate any industry briefings, tender briefings or site show-rounds with the relevant tender opportunities; and to engage with the procurement agency regarding any tender clarifications. Besides ensuring that the public sector obtains the best value-for-money, public procurement can serve the role of supporting the growth of promising SMEs and startups who have innovative solutions. In line with our strategy of supply diversification for resilience, can MOF’s \"value-for-money\" metric accommodate this aim? And what else can MOF do to help support the growth of promising SMEs through Government procurement?\n",

      "Mr Chairman, Sir, SMEs make up 99% of all businesses in Singapore's economy, employing nearly seven out of 10 workers and contributing close to half of our GDP. We should look for ways to further grow SMEs to large local enterprises (LLEs) to increase their scale and per capita contribution to our economy.Accordingly, I call upon MOF to facilitate more procurement opportunities for SMEs. What can MOF do to help support the growth of promising SMEs through Government procurements? In 2021, more than 80% of the procurement opportunities were open to SMEs. How can we further ensure that more such opportunities are made available for SMEs?Currently, a gap exists in contract value threshold for a request for quotations and tender. Also, can the Government review financial grading requirements for certain types of products and services to crowd source more innovative solutions? Some of these solutions can be provided by startups who may not meet the required financial grading due to the stage of their companies' growth. By doing so, the Government can tap on new innovations.An “in-between” or middle ground can exist, where there is a “tender-lite system” which can provide SMEs and startups procure opportunities more readily. Tenders do take significant time and resources for SMEs and startups which translates to opportunity costs.In relation to the point on opportunity costs, can the Government streamline its processes to help businesses save time and money in their transactions with Government agencies? Can these digital solutions and innovations in turn encourage more efficient ways of doing business between companies and their suppliers and customers?Mr Chairman, Sir, increasing access to public sector contracts and reducing cost and time to transact with Government at the tender and operational stages can significantly help grow our SMEs and startups.\n",

      "Sir, like many in this House, I was cheered when Singapore brought forward its Singapore's NDCs to reach net zero by 2050, and for the public sector to achieve net-zero emissions by around 2045.  This is a significant commitment and a non-trivial one to achieve, especially in the midst of an energy crisis. Many decarbonisation technologies are already ready today, but the speed of rollout depends on various other factors like infrastructure upgrades, business model and regulatory changes. EVs come to mind here. While other decarbonisation technologies, especially in hard to abate sectors of the economy, are not yet available at scale today. Until technologies like green hydrogen or CCUS become cost competitive versus carbon intensive alternatives, it will be difficult to mobilise the capital needed to scale and bring them down the cost curve over time. Governments must play their part to incentivise the flow of investment into these climate solutions, and the transition to these solutions given their cost disadvantage. By giving incentives to reduce the “green premium”, and through innovative risk sharing and financing structures, including public-private partnerships, Government can be the catalyst for a faster transition. Some governments have made bolder policy moves. The US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of August 2022 has been billed as the largest piece of federal legislation to address climate change. Investing $391 billion in provisions related to energy security and climate change, including tax incentives and a green bank. The tax credits of $3 per kg of hydrogen is particularly notable, turning the US into one of the cheapest countries in the world to produce green hydrogen.  In Singapore the Government has many fiscal and non-tax levers to drive the transition which it has used, such as carbon tax, and funding for research. Given recent developments, can the Minister provide an update on how MOF is supporting the transition to net zero?\n",

      "Chairman, we anticipate a tighter fiscal space in the coming years. There is scope for wealthy families, businesses and individuals to contribute meaningfully through philanthropy to our rising needs. Unlike a conventional system that relies heavily on taxation and redistribution, philanthropy offers the added benefit of strengthening our social compact.  The number of wealth owners and family offices in Singapore continues to grow at a healthy rate. Many of them have expressed interest to give back to society, both in Singapore and regionally. The Philanthropy Tax Incentive Scheme announced in Budget 2023 for Family Offices is another important step to facilitate philanthropy and to meet Singapore’s ambition to be Asia's philanthropic hub.   As we encourage philanthropy to continue to grow, it is important to ask what types of philanthropy will have the greatest impact on Singapore.  Prof Rob Reich of Stanford University has argued that philanthropy has a special role in discovery and experimentation, serving as society’s \"risk capital\" to foster innovation in important areas that deemed to carry too much risk for Government or private sector appetites.   As such, philanthropy can be catalytic and complementary to public funding – it can identify and support high-impact opportunities that are in its early stage. When the solutions are proven, philanthropists can partner with the public sector to scale them up.   It is also important to identify the most pressing areas of need where philanthropy can have the greatest impact. Take climate change as an example – it is an existential imperative, and the negative effects of climate change will also exacerbate other areas of need, such as global health and pandemics, inequality and displacement of communities.   As a recent McKinsey climate philanthropy report has noted, philanthropists possess both resources and expertise to support climate mitigation and adaptation solutions, especially in areas that may lack market support.    They can quickly deploy unrestricted funds in response to urgent problems such as natural disasters, back high-risk ventures, convene stakeholders and promote collaboration, develop and share research, and support large-scale implementation of climate solutions. So, I want to ask how can the Government foster support and public-private partnerships, both in Singapore and overseas, for such philanthropic causes, to address some of society’s most pressing challenges and issues? In promoting philanthropy, we must also consider policies across the continuum of doing good, which is wide-ranging and can include venture philanthropy, concessionary capital and impact investing – a broad range continuum.  Many wealth owners, especially those in the next generation, are looking towards these newer and more innovative approaches, sometimes referred to as “moon-shot” philanthropy.   So, we must also recognise that beyond grant making, there are other ways to give back such as volunteerism and the contribution of skills and networks. As the Government develops more initiatives and policies to promote philanthropy, how can it promote more diverse ways of doing good?The Chairman: Senior Minister of State Chee Hong Tat.\n",

      "Mr Chairman, I thank Members for their questions and suggestions.Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked how the Government ensures fiscal sustainability and spend prudently within our means. Besides the audits by the Auditor-General’s Office and our internal auditors, MOF conducts regular reviews of Ministries’ budgets to identify areas for improvement and ensures every Ministry uses its allocated resources efficiently and effectively.Singapore’s overall performance has been good, with current Government expenditure being around 18% of GDP. Even as our expenditures grow further and exceed 20% of GDP by 2030, our Government expenditure as a percentage of GDP is significantly lower than most developed countries. At the same time, we are able to achieve positive economic and social outcomes for Singapore and Singaporeans.  One example is how we reduce the costs of major Government infrastructure projects by applying a stringent cost-effectiveness evaluation together with experts from the private sector and academia. In 2022, we achieved total cost avoidance of around $1 billion through this process. This $1 billion saved means we can put it to good use and meet our spending needs in other areas.The Government also looks out for other forms of savings by integrating different projects to maximise the synergies. For example, the upcoming East Coast Integrated Depot, which incorporates three MRT depots and one bus depot, saved about 44 hectares of land. This is twice the land size of Changi Airport’s Terminal 4 or equivalent to approximately 60 football fields.  Another example is VITAL’s Demand Aggregation contracts for common buys such as office supplies, catering and courier services. These saved the Government more than $50 million per annum. This approach also reduces the need for agencies to call separate tenders and quotations, saving at least 100,000 man-hours a year.  Sir, Mr Liang, Mr Edward Chia, Ms Mariam Jafaar and Mr Saktiandi asked how MOF helps businesses to reduce costs and build capabilities for growth. The Government will continue to implement pro-business policies and measures and provide an environment that enables them to grow and succeed. Besides supporting businesses through our economic agencies and via a comprehensive suite of grants and incentives for innovation, productivity improvements and skills-upgrading, there are two additional areas where MOF’s work benefit our companies. First, by simplifying Government rules and processes, we enable businesses to save time and money when they transact with Government. Second, by helping businesses build capabilities to enhance their competitiveness and access new opportunities, both locally and abroad.Let me share some examples.We recently launched eGuarantee@Gov, a simple and secure digital process for businesses and individuals to provide a banker’s guarantee or insurance bond to Government agencies. Businesses can apply for an eGuarantee from over 20 participating financial institutions online for direct submission to Government agencies within a day. With eGuarantee@Gov, there is no longer a need to visit a bank to purchase a physical copy of the guarantee or to pay for courier services to deliver it. The new arrangement is quicker, better and cheaper. We expect up to 4,000 eGuarantees to be lodged in 2023, resulting in overall savings for all stakeholders of about $500,000 per year. There is also scope in the future for eGuarantees to extend to commercial transactions between businesses and their suppliers and customers. MOF and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) will work with the financial institutions and trade association and chambers to encourage adoption of eGuarantees for such transactions. Just as the use of PayNow for digital payments has allowed businesses and individuals to enjoy lower transaction costs and time savings compared to the traditional method of using cheques, the adoption of eGuarantees can bring about benefits compared to the current method of providing physical bank guarantees.Next, MOF removed the requirement for businesses with annual turnover of less than $5 million to submit audited accounts when applying for Government Supplier Registration. This benefits about 2,400 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) annually, with estimated cost savings of around $4.5 million per year. MOF continually makes improvements to GeBIZ, the Government-wide procurement system. For instance, about 3,000 businesses can benefit from the Supplier File Repository by the end of this year. Businesses no longer need to submit the same financial statements and company profile when responding to different Government quotations and tenders. We will also consider the features that Mr Saktiandi mentioned for future improvements.Sir, another example is Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore’s (IRAS) initiative to encourage businesses to use seamless filing software. Such software provides many productivity benefits for businesses, as they can automatically generate and file their corporate income tax computations and returns. This process takes only 15 minutes compared to the estimated eight hours required for manual preparation and submission.Moving on to the next area of how MOF supports businesses to develop capabilities for growth. We will continue to simplify our processes for suppliers, including SMEs, to participate in Government tenders while maintaining a level-playing field for all businesses and achieving value-for-money procurement outcomes. For procurement below $90,000, financial track record is not required. The terms and conditions are also simplified. For example, there is no requirement to provide security deposits. SMEs participate actively in our Government contracts and about 80% of these are awarded to SMEs annually. Winning Government contracts gives SMEs the opportunity to build up their track records, develop capabilities and capacity to tap into new growth areas. To further improve the access of SMEs to business opportunities through Government tenders, MOF will introduce a new category of tender by the end of 2023 called “Tender Lite”, which comes with fewer and simpler conditions. Tender Lite will allow more suppliers to participate in tenders with value higher than $90,000 but below $1 million and is estimated to cover over 70% of all Government tenders that are currently awarded to SMEs.MOF will work with representatives from Singapore Business Federation and the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises, as well as Government agencies on the design of Tender Lite. We believe this approach of Government and industry working together as partners will bring about win-win outcomes and allow us to move faster and innovate new solutions more effectively. My colleagues and I are keen to continue the partnership with our industry partners beyond Tender Lite and extend the collaboration to other subsequent areas of work that will benefit our businesses.Members such as Mr Derrick Goh have highlighted during the Budget debate that Government can help prepare SMEs for new requirements and opportunities in environmental sustainability. We agree. The public sector is supporting our suppliers’ efforts to adopt greener practices which are increasingly in demand by other major buyers. Over the years, the Government has incorporated environmental sustainability requirements into our procurement such as requiring information and communication technology (ICT) equipment and air conditioners to meet energy efficiency standards. Our target is to include environmental sustainability requirements and evaluation criteria into all Government procurement within the next five years, in a manner that keeps pace with industry readiness and international developments. Starting from FY2024, for tenders of construction projects and ICT projects with minimum estimated procurement value of $50 million and $10 million respectively, we will set aside up to 5% of the evaluation points for sustainability-related considerations. The Government will further engage the industry stakeholders on the details of these measures. Another capability that is increasingly sought after is sustainability reporting. Businesses that can provide good sustainability-related information can gain competitive advantage, expand into markets and potentially access cheaper funds through green financing.To drive sustainability reporting efforts for the industry, Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) and the Singapore Exchange Regulation established the Sustainability Reporting Advisory Committee in June 2022. The Committee will embark on its public consultations later this year.Businesses also need to accelerate their pace of digitalisation, a point which Mr Liang made. The Government will implement InvoiceNow as the default e-invoice submission channel for all Government vendors within the next few years. Using InvoiceNow will help businesses improve efficiency and reduce cost, by eliminating the need for manual processing and it also reduces errors. Businesses transacting on InvoiceNow can save $8 per invoice compared to the manual process. InvoiceNow also facilitates the direct transmission of invoices in a structured and standardised digital format that is accepted internationally across finance systems, and this helps businesses access overseas markets more easily. Today, about 55,000 businesses have adopted InvoiceNow, supported by 200 service providers. I encourage more businesses to come on board.Sir, Mr Liang and Ms Foo Mee Har asked how MOF will support and encourage more philanthropy and volunteerism from corporations and the community. Philanthropy and volunteerism are key elements for building a strong social compact. There is something intangible and different in how we build up the character of our society, when people go beyond what they are required to contribute under our fair and progressive tax and benefits system, where everyone contributes something and those who are better off contribute more. Many Singaporeans and also foreigners and companies who are based here, have an interest in philanthropy and are keen to help others in society. We have been strengthening our ecosystem to encourage their contributions and participation to maximise the positive impact to our local communities. This is a good way to keep our society cohesive and strengthen our solidarity as one united people. Not only through taxation and redistribution which are done through policies and laws but also through philanthropy and volunteerism which come from willing hands and loving hearts.  MOF provides funding support for many community and ground-up programmes which contribute to the development of the social sector. There are many existing efforts by agencies working with intermediaries like the Community Foundation of Singapore and ComChest, as well as beneficiaries to link up donors with suitable charitable causes. I have also met wonderful people such as those from Utama and Majurity Trust, who started initiatives to help raise donations from high net worth individuals and corporations to fund worthy social causes like caring for vulnerable seniors and providing opportunities for children from lower-income families.  The Government provides broad-based support in the form of 250% tax deductions for qualifying donations to Institutions of a Public Character (IPCs) and the Corporate Volunteer Scheme (CVS) supports volunteerism efforts by businesses in IPCs. The Government also provides matching grants to encourage charitable giving. For example, we allocated a top-up of $100 million to the Tote Board’s Enhanced Fundraising Programme which in turn provides dollar-for-dollar matching on eligible donations received by charities.Sir, to build stronger social resilience, the Government will continue to encourage our community especially those who have done well to engage in sustained giving and volunteerism. Through such efforts, we will strengthen our social compact and build a more caring and inclusive Singapore. This will then provide the social cohesion and stability for us to pursue pro-growth policies and enlarge our economic pie, generate more opportunities and provide more resources that we can then use to invest in our collective future and support the vulnerable amongst us.In this way, we can strengthen our social compact and grow our economy at the same time. The two objectives will reinforce and support each other, allowing us to move forward while staying together. The Chairman: Minister Indranee Rajah. \n",

      "Mr Chairman, I will be responding to the cuts filed by Mr Leon Perera and Mr Leong Mun Wai. Mr Leon Perera asked about the processes for obtaining the President’s recommendation to move a Bill, or amendments to a Bill tabled in Parliament. Mr Chairman, under Article 59(2) of the Constitution, Bills or amendments with financial implications cannot be introduced or moved in this House without the President’s recommendation. This mechanism ensures that the Government of the day has the sole right and responsibility to initiate financial legislation and therefore financial legislation cannot proceed without the Government’s support.It is very important to understand in this context, that for the purposes of Article 59(2), when the President gives his or her recommendation, it is upon the advice of the Government and not at the discretion of the President.If the recommendation is provided, then it shows that the legislation or amendment has the Government's support. This is different from the other provisions of the Constitution where the President acts upon his or her discretion, for example, in relation to draws on past reserves or the appointment of certain key appointment holders.Where the requirement in Article 59(2) is triggered and the Government does not support the Bill or amendment, there is no need to seek or to advise the President not to provide the recommendation. It is sufficient to inform the House that the Bill or amendment does not have the President's recommendation in accordance with the Standing Orders. Where the Government supports the Bill or the amendment, the Government will seek the recommendation of the President and formally advise the President to provide such recommendation.This requirement for Government support before financial legislation can be passed is a standard arrangement of many Commonwealth parliamentary democracies, although the mechanisms may vary.In Singapore, it is done through the mechanism of the President's recommendation, as I have explained. In New Zealand, where a Bill or amendment \"would have more than a minor impact on the Government's fiscal aggregates if it became law\", the government may issue a \"Financial veto certificate\" to state that it does not concur with the Bill or amendment, in which event, such Bill or amendment cannot be passed. In Canada, this is done by requiring the royal recommendation, which may only be obtained by a Minister, to be conveyed to Parliament.While the mechanisms may vary from country to country, the principle underpinning them is the same. That is to say, a Bill or an amendment with financial implications cannot be passed if the government of the day does not support it, in recognition of the principle that responsibility for financial matters lies with the Government. So, earlier, when Mr Leon Perera talked about \"deeming\", there is no \"deeming\" involved. If the Government does not support the Bill or the amendment, the Government would not even need to put it to the President. But if the Government supports it, then the Government will put it to the President with the requisite advice and the recommendation would be signified in Parliament. Hence, the Council of Presidential Advisers (CPA) is also not engaged because this is not a discretionary function of the President. The President may consult the CPA for the discretionary functions.For a Government Bill falling within the scope of Article 59(2), the Minister giving notice of the introduction of the Bill must indicate whether the President's recommendation is required and when introducing the Bill at First Reading, must signify whether the recommendation has been obtained. This is provided for in Standing Order 67(1).Members may recall that a few days ago, I introduced the Supply Bill. When I introduced the Supply Bill, I signified to the Chamber that I had the President's recommendation.In the case of a private Member's Bill, the Minister for Finance has to inform the Speaker whether the President's recommendation is required under Article 59(2). If the Minister for Finance informs the Speaker that the President's recommendation is in fact required, then, before the Member can be called upon to move the Motion seeking leave to introduce this Bill under Standing Order 66(1), a Cabinet Minister must signify to Parliament whether the President's recommendation has been obtained.If no such recommendation has been obtained, the Speaker shall not allow the Motion for leave to introduce the Bill to be moved. The same procedure applies to amendments proposed to Bills. That is under Standing Order 74(3)(c). One more thing I should add, which is that if a Member intends to propose a Bill or amendments to a Bill, which make provision directly or indirectly for the list of financial matters listed in Article 59(2), he or she should inform the Ministry or Minister with oversight of the matters in the Bill or amendment as soon as possible and ideally no later than the time of filing the relevant notices with Parliament so that the relevant assessments and steps can be taken. If the Member is not sure whether the matters in the Bill or amendment are caught by the provisions of Article 59(2), then all the more so it would be advisable to inform the relevant Ministry or Minister early. That deals with Mr Perera's cut. I move on to Mr Leong Mun Wai's cuts.Sir, Mr Leong Mun Wai had a series of, I think, five questions. Mr Leong did not provide the indication of these beforehand. Normally in the gist of the Budget cuts, Members are asked to provide the gist. I also do send out a notice, generally, to ask people to provide the gist of their cuts because it will then enable us to respond in a more considered or fuller manner. With respect to the five questions which basically were given on the spot, I will give such replies as I can. If the Member has any other things, it will have to be taken up separately. Let me just run through very quickly.I think the first question was on the termination of the Sports Hub. I would say in response the reason for the termination of the Sports Hub was addressed in the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY)'s Ministerial Statement in August 2022.The reasons for the urgency and the use of the Contingency Fund was: first, the transaction was market sensitive; and second, it was an opportune time to develop the Kallang Alive precinct as the sports sector recovered from COVID-19. The termination sum will be paid in this financial year.For his second question on the SPH Media Trust, that is from the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI)'s annual budget from FY2022 to FY2026. However, no money has been disbursed as Minister Josephine Teo had said in Parliament. For his third question, disbursement figures from the Government statutory funds are in the Government Financial Statements. The disbursement figures for the funds under the Statutory Boards are included in their financial statements.For his fourth question, the audit of the full $72.3 billion will be completed by the end of FY2024. This was answered earlier this month by Senior Minister of State Chee in a response to a Parliamentary Question.For the fifth question, I think the answers there can be found in the Budget Book.Then, with regard to his last point about what is the definition of \"raiding the reserves\", Mr Chairman, it is not a term of art. Essentially, we have a framework on how the reserves are to be used. When the principal amount is taken or drawn down or when land is alienated and if it is not made good or put back, that is a draw on the reserves.It is a simple principle that we adhere to. The framework is clear. It is not necessary for me to go into a definitional argument. The reasons and the rationale of when you can have a draw on the reserves are clear. A pandemic would be a good reason – when you are facing potential catastrophe and you have to save the economy, you have to save people. That is something that is built into the current framework. The reserves can only be used with the agreement of the President.The Chairman: Mr Leong Mun Wai.\n",

      "Mr Leong Mun Wai\n",

      "Chairman, I thank the Minister for the reply. I have three questions. One is that given the kind of payments like the Sports Hub and also SPH Media Trust, where is a big payment to a third party, what is the procedure whereby the Parliament can come in and have oversight over such expenditure? Meaning, how far can the Government just approve the expenditure, just like that?For example, now, we have this SINGA Bill where infrastructural projects that are more than $4 billion require – when it goes through the SINGA Bill, then it comes to Parliament. But does it mean that if in the future, there is a project where we need to terminate the project and it is a $4 billion payout, the Government just makes the decision like that without Parliament scrutinising the numbers? That is one question.The second question is, to your best knowledge as the Second Minister for Finance, what is the percentage of the endowment funds that are being paid out every year – as a percentage of the outstanding assets that these endowment funds have at the moment? The third question, with regards to the raiding of reserves. Your question basically means – does it mean that as long as the Government has a set of rules, we cannot debate against that set of rules? In this case, it is a set of rules regarding reserves management and the recording of the reserves. You can always say that what you have proposed is not in line with our reserve management policies but we can still discuss about it. There is no need to say right from the beginning, that this is a raiding the reserves and it is not only one time, but many many times by many people and over the mass media and all that.The Chairman: Could we keep it concise so that others can ask their clarifications?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That is my third question. Okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms Indranee Rajah\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I thank the Member for his clarifications. I think his first question is related to what authority does the Government have and what is the relationship with Parliament and the degree of oversight. I should start off with the first premise, which is that when the people elect the Government, it is to govern. It is to run the Government. Therefore, there are quite a large scope of things which is under the authority of the Government.The Government, obviously, has to be accountable. Hence, when the Government is accountable, it has to come back to Parliament for various things. But when it comes to Parliament, it is usually to scrutinise broad policy and not the day-to-day operational matters.So, the debate that we just had, for example, the Budget debate we call it the Budget debate but actually, people forget what it actually is. It is a Motion to ask this House to approve the Government's financial policy. You approve the financial policy, all those broad headings and the broad expenditure that is agreed to by Parliament, but the details of how that is to be spent if it is within the block budget, that is really within the Ministries' purview.But if it is thought, for example, that the Ministry has not done well in its expenditure, that can be queried in Parliament either through Parliamentary Questions, and we also have the Estimates Committee, which is a standing Parliamentary Select Committee which examines the Government's Budget and raises questions thereon. I think that is available to the Member as well. So, we have a whole series of checks and balances. You have got the Constitution, which sets the framework. The fiscal policy or financial policy is subject to Parliamentary approval and subject to debate. We have got the Estimates Committee. There is also the Public Accounts Committee. It is also subject to independent audits by the Auditor-General's Office (AGO). The Public Accounts Committee also examines the Government's accounts and the AGO's report and calls on the relevant agencies to explain particular issues or to take corrective actions.For the second question on the extent of funds paid out every year, since that is a very specific question requiring certain data, perhaps the Member can file a question on that. I do not have that offhand.The third question was, I think the Member put it this way – he said does it mean that if the Government has a set of rules, we cannot debate it because he said we can always say it is not in line. He also said that there was no need to say that it is raiding one time but all the time. Let me deal with the two separately.The first one – does it mean that we have a set of rules? The answer is yes. We do have a set of rules. Does it mean that you cannot debate the rules? No. If you want to change the reserves framework, by all means, you can debate that. You can suggest that it should be changed. But so long as the rules are in place and so long as what is proposed is not in conformance with those rules and is a draw on the reserves, then it means that it falls outside or breaches, if you like, or it is not in accordance with the rules.So, there are two things. You have a set of rules. And if you want to debate whether that should or should not be the rule, that is entirely up to that Member's prerogative. But if what you happen to be proposing does not fall within the rules, then the Government is entitled to say that it would be a draw or, put it in a slightly easier to understand form, it will be a raid on the reserves.And secondly, Mr Leong suggested that there is no need to say raiding the reserves, not one time but many, many times. The answer is that, if your proposals do actually intend to draw down the reserves not one time but many, many times, then, inevitably, it will draw the reaction that you are raiding not one time but many, many times. So, it all depends on your proposal. The Chairman: Mr Liang Eng Hwa.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sorry, Mr Chairman, I just wanted to clarify something to make sure I was absolutely accurate in my answer to Mr Leon Perera earlier, about when the President consults the Council of Presidential Advisors (CPA). I just wanted to clarify that the President must consult the Council before exercising any discretionary power, unless it is one of the excluded matters in Article 37I(A)2, that she only needed to consult in some situations.The Chairman: Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Chairman, I thank Mr Perera for his clarification. But actually, this procedure is a very long-standing procedure, not just ours, but it is a feature of the Westminster model and parliamentary democracies.In other words, these procedures, you may call it elaborate. It is a polite way of coming to Parliament to say that you need the Government's support. Many of the things which have its roots in parliamentary procedure from the Westminster model come from these – you could say, these courtesies of the past. The New Zealanders, as I described, are a little bit more direct about it. It is just a government \"veto certificate\". \"Nope\" and that is it. But we are doing it in a polite way. We signify whether the President has given her recommendation. Whether or not the President gives her recommendation, would depend on whether or not the Government gives its support.It does not in any way affect the standing of the President. It was a very early feature of our Constitution. And you will find it, if you check, you will find it in many different ways, shapes or forms in other Commonwealth jurisdictions.And so, it is not so much a question of box-ticking, certainly not the case. It is very much a case of observing certain proprieties which are laid out and, in a way, that has a long-standing tradition.The Chairman: Very quick one. Mr Saktiandi. We have to end it by .\n",

      "Sir, just want to come back to the question I raised in my cut which is whether the Government can do more to review our rules and procedures so that we can be more pro-business and help businesses save cost and save time.I often hear this feedback from the businesses. The pain point is always that the Government rules can be quite cumbersome and some are unnecessary and the procedures can be quite inefficient. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State again if the Government can do more here. \n",

      "Mr Chairman, I thank Mr Liang for asking this very important question. The Government deals with quite a lot of businesses: in our capacity as regulator, when they are applying for licence, they need our permit to operate; or as a buyer, when we procure services and then they are our suppliers.In both instances, there is scope for us to continue to look for ways in which we can do better in our interactions with businesses especially smaller businesses, the SMEs, because they do not have a lot of resources. So, when we design our licensing framework, when we design our rules and procedures, we also want to make sure that they are able to comply with not too much difficulty.Sir, I want to highlight that this is not just an MOF effort. This is actually a whole-of-Government effort. And my colleagues from the other Government Ministries and agencies, have also been embarking on this initiative. One of the initiatives, Mr Liang is aware, is the Pro-Enterprise Panel under the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) where we regularly solicit feedback from businesses and from trade associations on where are some of the pain points and where are some of the areas for improvement.I recall, a few years ago, when I was with MTI, I shared an example of how we used business process, re-engineering and digital transformation to implement Go-Business licensing portal where we shortened the processing time for food-related businesses when they applied for licenses by up to 14 days and we cut down the number of forms that they need to submit. Previously, I think it was 14 altogether, more than 800 data fields. We did some consolidation and we reduced it to one form with fewer than 90 data fields, and we removed some of the duplicate licences and helped them to save on licensing fees. When you remove some of these, then they do not have to apply, do not have to pay.This is something we want to keep doing and it has to be a partnership with our businesses and our trade associations, because the Government may not know fully where are all the pain points and where are all the areas for improvement. But from the users' point of view, the businesses will know. That is why I mentioned in my speech earlier that I want to work closely with SBF and ASME, not just to improve on the tender processes by introducing Tender Lite, which is one of the ways to help businesses, but also on other pro-business initiatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Chairman, the current payment term for the Government to pay our suppliers is within 30 days. And this is a standard that I would say, is comparable, if not, better than some of the other governments and even private sector companies. But we will want to work towards, where possible, to shorten the payment period. Because, as the Member correctly pointed out, this will directly benefit our SMEs in terms of cashflow.I would want to caveat that a little bit by saying that it depends really on the nature of the contract. There are some that are more straightforward – the service has been provided, the product has been delivered, everything is okay, we can try and speed it up. But there are some that may require more evaluation because it is not so straightforward, or if the amounts are much bigger and we need to be careful, with due diligence, in order to ensure value for money and prudent spending.Rather than to have sort of a blanket yes or no, we will certainly aim to work towards where we can – for simpler, more straightforward contracts, smaller amounts, we try our best to go within 14 days. But larger amounts, more complex contracts, we may need to give the agencies a bit more time so that they also can safeguard the interests of public funds.The Chairman: Mr Leon Perera.\n",

      "Mr Chairman, Mr Saktiandi raised an important point because we do not just focus on the large ticket items. Those are very important, because, as I mentioned in my speech earlier, we managed to save $1 billion dollars through the process together with experts from private sector and academia.But many of the smaller projects on their own, may not yield a lot of savings. But if you add them all up and there are many of them, could make a positive impact on our overall value-for -money outcome.So, we have been encouraging the Ministries and —The Chairman: You can just quickly wrap up.\n",

We will facilitate experimentation, trying out some of these new ideas. And even if some of them were to fail along the way, because we are doing some pilots and it is not guaranteed that all of these would succeed, it is okay. It is okay to try because we are all working towards a better outcome.The Chairman: It is okay. Thank you. Mr Liang Eng Hwa, would you like to withdraw your amendment?\n",

The hon Member Mr Liang had suggested earlier on and, if I heard correctly, that so long as we have a positive NIRC, then the Budget must necessarily be expansionary.May I first clarify that that was indeed what he said.And, if so, since the NIRC has been consistently positive, at least since 2008, would that mean that he believes that over the past decade and a half, that we have never run a contractionary fiscal stance? And I am wondering if the Minister of Finance or anyone from the Finance Ministry is willing to corroborate this characterisation.If what the Member meant was, so long as the sum of the NIRC and revenue is less than expenditure, then it is expansionary. I actually have no quarrel with that. But since the NIRC has, in fact, been positive, this would actually mean an even greater surplus over expenditure, which would mean an even more contractionary budget, contrary to an expansionary one.The Chairman: Mr Liang.\n",

I have two clarifications for Senior Minister of State Chee, not on philanthropy because the question roughly is answered, but two clarifications regarding a debate brought up here.First, Senior Minister of State spoke about Government's effort to support businesses, especially SMEs. So, how we pay them is going to be important. I would like to ask, this has been brought up in previous speeches, what is Government's plan to try and pay the businesses transacts within 14 days? Is that achievable, that request from Nominated Member of Parliament Ms Janet Ang?The second clarification is, what is the targeted adoption rate for e-invoice for transaction with Government? The Senior Minister of State spoke about that just now. I want to ask what happens if some SMEs have not put in place the necessary infrastructure? Does that mean they cannot participate in Government procurement?\n",

      "Thank you, Mr Chairman. I would like to thank Minister Indranee Rajah for her reply to my cut.I just have one clarification, and I appreciate her laying out the process for seeking the President's recommendation on Bills, with fiscal implications as well as speaking about areas of exercisable discretion and so on. Those points are well taken.My clarification is just about why there is a need to have this rather curious and complicated procedure, where for these matters, something is referred to the President, but then, the Cabinet instructs the President to act in a very prescriptive way and President has to act that way and then the Bill can move forward in Parliament.It does not seem to serve any constructive purpose, in terms of time and the administrative effort and efficiency. And moreover, would the Minister give some thought to the consideration I raised? There is a potential disamenity in keeping such arrangements in place which is that of the President being seen to be a part of this sort of procedure which involves box-ticking or rubber stamping. It could be seen that way. It does not really help the standing of the Office of the President and just seems unnecessary.Will the Government consider reforming this aspect of the Constitution to sort of do away with that procedural step. And before I resume my seat, I just want to say that it should be clear that we have debated in this Chamber before on the Workers' Party's position on the Presidency —The Chairman: If you could keep it short on this point. \n",

I am just glad that we are discussing today about cost savings when our neighbour just released their budget and they are talking about cutting their deficits and reducing the government debt.My question is to Senior Minister of State Chee, in response to his answer to my cards. In regard to the scrutiny of infrastructure spending, he answered that question in terms of public accounts. But, maybe, if Senior of Minister of State can share a bit more about our cost savings and our efforts from smaller projects, smaller to medium-term projects, and what additional sort of scrutiny and efforts to review those and how we can enhance on that front as well.\n",

       "['Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"that the following Address in reply to the Speech of the President be agreed to: \\'We, the Parliament of the Republic of Singapore, express our thanks to the President for the Speech which she delivered on behalf of the Government at the Opening of the Second Session of this Parliament\\'.\"Sir, a week ago in this House, her Excellency Mdm Halimah Yacob, the President of the Republic of Singapore, delivered a speech on the priorities, policies and programmes of the Government for the remainder of the current term of office.  A plain review of the President’s speech and the 21 addenda issued by the respective Ministries and Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) since, reveals much more than that.The plans go well beyond the remainder of the current term of this Government’s office. A good number of these plans, especially the ones dealing with the transformation of our defence capabilities, implementing our net zero ambition, developing our sustainable aviation and maritime hubs, transport systems and infrastructural capabilities and building an innovation economy will take decades to complete.These plans are not just incremental in nature. They are imaginative and involve stretch targets. They are aimed at delivering decisive advantages to Singaporeans of the future. And I fully support them.They are not at all easy to achieve. To materialise these plans, we require the strong support of fellow Singaporeans. We also need highly competent and dedicated leaders at all levels of government, including the political leadership, to execute these plans.This is the defining characteristic of this People’s Action Party (PAP) Government.It sees as its responsibility not just to take care of the current generation of Singaporeans for the near term. All our present-day advantages, hard won on the back of generations past are not considered, I quote, “a pinnacle of achievement, but as a base from which to scale new heights.”It sees as its bounden duty to lay strong foundations for future generations of Singaporeans. Indeed, this principle of steward leadership is specifically embedded in the concluding paragraph of the President’s speech. She urges us to, I quote, \"keep faith with future generations yet unborn and build a Singapore that thrives and endures for many years to come.” The approach taken by the Government gives us in this House a unique opportunity.It is my hope that hon Members who will be speaking during this debate will nail their colours to the mast and unequivocally state where they stand on the Government’s ambitious plans to build an enduring and thriving Singapore for now and years to come. By doing so, we will be able to explore building a consensus on these plans. This will include an agreement on funding the projects involved in the plans. We will also be able to avoid the polarising effect of these long-term plans becoming political “footballs” of populist politicians. What we cannot afford to do as a small country with no natural resources is to adopt a “stop/start” or “feast and famine” approach in funding these important plans. Such an approach will quickly deplete our precious resources and will almost certainly spell doom for Singapore.Importantly, as I will be alluding to shortly in my speech, it is my belief that building consensus in this House on such key plans will help us retain trust and unity which the President has identified to be essential for the future of Singapore.  I start with the issue of trust. The President stated in her speech that as we emerged from the pandemic, trust in the Government has strengthened. The President also emphasised that trust and unity are key to dealing with our priorities that includes securing our place in the world, growing our economy and refreshing our social compact.Indeed, today, Singapore is in a fortunate position to be a high trust country. I looked at the Edelman Trust Barometer 2023 that was reported on CNA on 15 March 2023. Trust in our Government as an institution was reported to be relatively high compared to a vast number of other countries. But we are not among the top three. So, we should not behave as though we have arrived. The results of the survey are consistent with anecdotal experience. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is the strong trust between our people and our Government that led to higher levels of vaccination, which in turn ensured that we kept mortality rates low and allowed us to reopen our borders and rebuild our lives much faster than in many other countries.We also know, though, that the trust built today can be easily lost tomorrow. This is the impermanent nature of this “being”. Trust cannot be assumed; it has to be conscientiously built and nurtured. The question I raise is how do we ensure that this strategic resource in the form of the reservoir of trust between our people and Government can be retained and even deepened as our nation navigates through an even more challenging socioeconomic environment?There are many facets to this. I wish to draw focus on three areas: (a) the work of our Public Service officers; (b) the work of our political leaders in this House; and at the end of my speech (c) the Forward Singapore exercise conducted by our 4G Team.The Public Service plays a vital role in the maintenance of trust between our people and the Government. It will continue to play an important role in future. Sir, we are indeed fortunate to have very committed and hardworking public service officers dedicated to their respective organisational missions, the rule of law, securing Singapore’s national interests and improving the lives of Singaporeans. In my respectful view, the strong trust relationship that we enjoy today is attributable in a significant part to the blood, sweat and tears of our officers in discharging their solemn duties. To underscore this point, Sir, please allow me to share that, not infrequently, I receive detailed email replies from public officers, especially from the Housing and Development Board (HDB), to my queries on behalf of my constituents in the wee hours of morning! I cannot help feeling bad for them as they obviously sacrificed their personal time with their families to deal with official work. These officers have a strong sense of duty. We owe them a huge debt of gratitude.   What I feel distinguishes our Public Service from others is that in both design and implementation, our officers have foremost in their minds the ordinary Singapore Citizen. In their roles, they serve to strike a balance between achieving policy objectives, exemplifying values such as compassion and fairness, accountability for the use of national resources and the desire to do justice in each and every case.Let me provide two examples by reference to my Meet-the-People Session (MPS) cases just on issues arising from Budget 2023 in the past few weeks.  Last month, I wrote an appeal on behalf of Mdm Zhu, who had just given birth to a baby girl, seeking the enhanced Baby Bonus cash gift as announced in Budget 2023. Her baby, Qi Yue, was born at 5.00 pm on 13 February 2023. This was seven hours too early as the enhanced Baby Bonus cash gift, which would have been disbursed seven to 10 days after registration of the baby’s birth, was meant for babies born on or after 14 February 2023.Mdm Zhu mentioned that her baby was born earlier than expected. This turns out to be a significant ground of appeal. In fact, the Baby Bonus Cash Gift policy was designed to allow babies due to be born on or after 14 February 2023 but were delivered earlier to get enhanced cash gifts too. By being flexible and not mechanically applying the timeline, we managed to achieve a better balance between the policy intent and the legitimate expectation of the ordinary citizen.  My reward was that I got a photo of Baby Qi Yue who happened to lift her head for the first time on the day that the Government allowed Mdm Zhu’s appeal! So, maybe she approved too.  I now turn to my next example. In Budget 2023, an announcement was made on the GST Voucher - Cash (Seniors’ Bonus). The policy intent was to help lower-income senior Singapore Citizens aged 55 and above cope with the cost of living. To gauge the financial circumstances of the senior, the Government uses the income earned in 2021 as a proxy. It has to be less than $34,000.  I had a situation where my resident earned more than $34,000 in 2021 but had a significant drop in income in 2022 owing to personal circumstances. Technically, my resident did not qualify. However, having regard to the policy intent of the bonus, the Ministry of Finance (MOF), in its reply to the petition issued by me on behalf of my resident, was prepared to be flexible. It sought documents supporting my resident’s claim that his income dropped significantly in 2022 before assessing whether it is prepared to provide him with the bonus on a discretionary basis.Again, this is an enlightened approach and there is much to commend the Public Service for exercising flexibility to ensure that the policy intent is met.Sir, I do not mean to advocate that all appeals are automatically granted, regardless of merit. Far from it. What I am drawing attention to is the process. Our citizens must feel that they were listened to, their views considered seriously and they received proper explanations in a respectful manner on the outcomes even if they may disagree with them. This approach will, in my view, deepen this strategic resource of trust between our people and the Government as an institution. Trust is the red thread running through the three points that the President made in her speech which made an impression on me.  First, the President highlighted the need for us, as a little red dot, to close ranks and stay united against global forces which will continue to try even harder to influence our domestic public opinion, so as to uphold Singapore’s vital interests.  Hon Members may recall the debate in this House on the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Bill that was passed in 2021 to deal with hostile information campaigns by foreign powers. What I thought significant then was the united view expressed by hon Members on both sides of the aisle that Singapore politics is for Singaporeans. As responsible politicians, we must continue to close ranks and hold the line on core issues of national importance.Second, the President highlighted that this unity as a nation will be important as we aim to secure economic opportunities amid a global economic slowdown to strengthen our position as a trusted and reliable business hub adding value to the world.On this, it may be useful to emphasise one important takeaway from this year’s Budget debate. The raison d’etre behind our economic objectives was never economic growth for its own sake. Rather, growth is a means to achieve our broader objectives of advancing the well-being of every Singaporean. We are already facing strong economic headwinds. The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) reported last Friday that our economy grew by only 0.1 % in the first quarter of 2023. This affects our prospects for growth this year with inflation still running high. Economists are predicting a technical recession. The challenge facing us is clear. It seems to me what the President advocated in her speech about making sure Singapore is united in the context of a global economic slowdown has become all the more important now.  Third, the President emphasised the need to strengthen our social compact through programmes aimed at uplifting the disadvantaged and vulnerable and to keep us as one united people. The President identified this effort as a priority of the 4G team which is engaging Singaporeans through the Forward Singapore exercise to renew and update our social compact. I will talk more on the Forward Singapore exercise later in my speech. The President also laid down the Government’s four key priorities to strengthen our social compact: (a) expanding opportunities for all, (b) strengthening social safety nets, (c) building a smart and liveable city and (d) deepening Singaporean’s sense of shared identity. In particular, the President stated that the Government will look into ensuring that advantages and privileges that may come with meritocracy does not become entrenched such that it weakens our society.  This point about the need to re-examine meritocracy was probably the most quoted point by my residents about the President’s speech whom I engaged with before drafting this speech. All of them expressed wholehearted agreement with the President. They agreed with the Government’s call to devote more resources to our children who start out with less. The support, however, is not just a question of fact, but a matter of degree too in order that we can make a tangible difference for these children. The Government has already made substantial investments in our children from humble backgrounds, particularly at rental flats through programmes like the Kindergarten Fee Assistance Scheme (KiFAS) and the Community Link (ComLink).One other area of potential support that the Government should consider is to address the housing environment of children living in overcrowded flats. This is a point that I have raised several times; the last being at the Ministry of National Development (MND)\\'s Committee of Supply (COS) 2023 debate during my speech on strengthening inclusivity in housing. In my speech, I said “each child is precious, and we must do our utmost to ensure that they grow up in more conducive housing environment”.To be fair, based on statistics provided by HDB, there are not many such cases, but I have come across a few.One possible way that can be considered is to provide for Social Service Agencies to run study centres for these children near rental flats that are open after school. In this way, our children will be able to study in a more conducive environment after school. In Bukit Batok, we have one example in the form of Tava by Talent Beacon, which is a non-profit organisation that sets up a study centre specially for children living in our rental flats, with the support of MND and HDB. Tava even provides study support and mentoring for these children.At the same time, the President emphasised the need for a stronger network of stakeholders to help provide opportunities for all, participate in nation building and build unity. This is not just the Government’s responsibility. I agree and I believe that all hon Members feel the same way too. The question is how can we achieve this? How do we get more committed stakeholders?During the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF)\\'s COS debate this year, I highlighted that over the past five years between FY2016 and FY2020, the amount of tax-deductible donations per year remained more or less stable at $1 billion. I said then that we need to do something more fundamental to move this needle. I suggested that successful organisations and individuals must feel more invested in the lives of the less fortunate. They must know that we are bound together in one common destiny. We sink or swim together.This is clearly not an easy ask but we must quite clearly put in as much effort as possible to realise this objective. One area where stakeholders can help is to level the playing field when it comes to giving our children sporting experiences which are perceived to be within the exclusive domain of the well-to-do.Let me make my point through an example. I am not a golfer, but I have certainly read about the amazing story of Mr Mardan Mahmat, who was Singapore’s number one golfer for more than 10 years.His is a rags-to-riches story. He dropped out of primary school at the age of 12. A year later, he became a caddie at Jurong Country Club. As a teenager, Mardan frequently snuck into the club’s golf course when no one was looking and, by himself, learned how to play the game. He obviously had loads of talent because he managed to hone it by himself. Long story short, he became Singapore’s number one golfer.Mardan’s story is exceptional. The reality now is that children from low- or middle-income backgrounds will find it difficult to gain access to more expensive sports, such as golf.I do think though that something can be done through stakeholders with the appropriate resources to organise efforts to reach out to interested children, give them the sporting experience, suss out from among them the next Mardan Mahmat whom they can help to nurture to be a Singapore golf champion.I am aware that many of these stakeholders already do wonderful charity work. I do hope though that they can consider this as a worthwhile extension of their efforts. The idea here is to provide children with the requisite talent and drive, regardless of their background, with opportunities to pursue their sporting dreams and become national athletes.I now turn to the work of political leaders in this House.The President stated in her speech that the trust between the political leadership and the people is a key strength that we must continue to nurture. The President gave important guidance in this regard. She advised that our interactions as politicians be anchored on mutual respect and the shared goal of advancing the larger public interest. We should work through our differences, enlarge our common ground and draw strength from our diverse perspectives.I fully agree. We, politicians, are at our best when we present our arguments in a measured way, recognise the inherent trade-offs in each of the policy suggestions that we make and present cogent arguments as to why we feel the balance should be struck one way or another.What the President stated brought to my mind the speech that I made during the opening of the 14th Parliament when I advocated several proposals for Parliamentary reform of our evolving democracy. I said then that building consensus in this House is an important outcome of our work here. I described consensus as a process of contestation, persuasion and resolution. Equally important is that such engagement will enable Singaporeans outside this House to have a better opportunity to understand the points of agreement, points of disagreement raised by their elected representatives and, through that, they will be able to better appreciate how these points impact on the ordinary lives of Singaporeans.This is a form of accountability, too. Singapore has always preferred an undramatic approach to problem solving. This is our political heritage from the first generation of our political pioneers. Some of you may have recognised that I quoted a line from Dr Goh Keng Swee at the start of my speech – that we must consider our starting today merely as a base to build tomorrow.Dr Goh was one of our deepest policy thinkers. He said, and I quote, “Deciding on policy and determining a line of action is different from engaging in a debate. Cabinet government is not a debating society or an academic seminar. These are intellectual exercises. Views are aired and, if done with style and elegance, the participants go home happy. In Government, you have to live with the consequences of your decision. If you make a mistake, the results are painful. In political life, there is no alibi for failure.”I feel that we, in Parliament, should bear this in mind. When we deal with the real issues in this House, we know that they often matter to millions of lives. When we say that we are not “ideological” about something, it means that we are not wedded to whether the idea is from the left or the right, from the PAP or the Opposition, we are not wedded to repeating yesterday’s solutions tomorrow.We should be disinterested in merely sounding good. On their own, they do not serve the interests of Singaporeans.It is against this background that I argue the need for constructive politics in Parliamentary proceedings. Here, it may be useful to recount the debate that we had in this House on the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Bill.Before the Second Reading of the Bill in this Parliament, there were concerns within certain quarters about the broad language of the Bill and perceived lack of judicial oversight. My hon friends across the aisle proposed amendments to the Bill to address, among others, these points. Hence, even before the hon Minister for Home Affairs delivered his Second Reading speech, lines were already drawn. This led to the hon Minister making a plea in this House to hon Members not to use Parliament as a forum to read out prepared speeches based on lines that were already drawn before he rendered his speech.When I rose to speak on the Bill, I highlighted that whilst there were important differences between the views of the hon Members from both sides of the aisle, they were few, compared to the substantive areas of agreement between them. I do not remember a single journalist covering this point in his or her article.I am not surprised. In my speech on building consensus in Parliament, I said that, and I quote “agreement, collegiality, friendliness, all these make for poor headlines”. Contestation sells, not consensus. As a result, the public perceived that there was a wide chasm between the hon Members of the governing and opposition parties on Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act (FICA) than what was, in fact, the case.For these reasons, I advocate an introspection within each of us in this House to build the common ground that the President referred to in her speech. Parliamentary proceedings should not be turned into arenas for “entertainment” that we regularly see in other countries. This will erode our people’s trust and confidence in their elected representatives. That will be very bad for Singapore.Finally, and importantly, I turn to the Forward Singapore Exercise.As we all know, the Forward Singapore Exercise conducted by our 4G leadership involves engaging thousands of Singaporeans from all walks of life. These engagements are aimed at identifying the values, priorities and policies needed to strengthen our social compact and to build a better and brighter Singapore.I wish to make two points on the Forward Singapore Exercise. First, as we look forward, we should not forget the values that allowed us to make progress as a nation. I, therefore, feel that the President’s reminder that we should hold dear to our core values as Singaporeans is a timely one. This is the enduring legacy of our founding generation of leaders led by our founding Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.At the same time – and this my second point – I feel that it is important for the Forward Singapore Exercise to adequately capture the idealism of our youths so that they will be able to identify with and support our vision for the future. After all, they have the biggest stake in our plans for the future.A few weeks ago, during a house visit, I met my resident, Mr Sherman Chua, aged 21. He is working with a Silicon Valley company in the artificial intelligence (AI) space.As we all know, this space is simply “exploding” at the moment with the advent of ChatGPT and so on. He told me that as a result of his exposure to this space, he is convinced that life as we know it will change a lot through imminent and rapid adoption of AI. He expressed to me his concern that Singapore is not investing enough resources to get ahead in this area. In his view, if nothing is done in this space within the next five years, Singapore may be passed over and runs the risk of becoming a laggard. I invited him to drop me an email containing his views and I will link him up with the relevant pillar leads in the Forward Singapore Exercise.I am sure there are other young people like Sherman in our communities. It will serve the 4G Team well to engage such people so that their views on the shared vision for the future are taken onboard. I look forward to receiving the 4G Team’s report on the Forward Singapore Exercise that is expected to be issued in the second half of this year.Sir, let me conclude. If we are to consider Singapore as a base to scale and not a pinnacle on which we rest, we must recognise that the nature of the electorate is changing. It has been changing since World War Two ended – a generation that has never known war, communalism, death by gunshot or violence, days of hunger, or nights of terror.Today, a new generation is emerging, standing taller and brighter than the ones before. Their education is deeper, their social support tighter and with more social spending per person than ever before in our history. In health, education, housing and transport, we are doing much more to provide all Singaporeans with better services and to support the more vulnerable groups. As a result, we have, today, a generation that has never experienced hardship to the same degree and scale of the past. From the start of their working life, they understand that they can ask for work-life balance and mental wellness days, not as entitlements but as a fact of Singaporean life. These are the natural fruits of 60 years of careful tending. Our people today would naturally have different responses to Government policies than those of the past.Human response is not an artifice. This word “lived experience” is used quite a lot today. Some may feel uncomfortable at how it elevates subjective experience to a policy truth on which we often build an edifice of rights and allocations. The fact remains that people’s psyche will change and, as they do, their government must change and to a degree and at a speed unprecedented. We cannot be an analogue government in a digital world, if we are to keep faith with our fellow Singaporeans.All this is not to say that Singaporeans are less tough today than we were in the past or that we rise any slower to a challenge. We are a people new to pandemics and the world has not seen the scale and intensity of COVID-19. But Singapore overcame. History is a good teacher but, like PSLE mathematics, we do not need to have worked out the same sum before to get the right answer in a new one.We are a different people today and require a new style and substance in our policies. Two things which guided our leaders after the war must not change. First, to achieve prosperity so as to ensure happiness and peace for our people; and second, to ensure that Singapore continues to survive as an independent nation.The President’s speech, like those of almost all Presidents before her, speaks of the need to ensure that Singapore “endures for many years to come”. No large country suffers from this same paranoia. But this is the nature of small states – to be short-lived. We are either annexed or merged and, in fact, we ourselves thought this at the start.There is nothing external to ourselves, no partners or allies that will ensure the survival of this improbable nation. We must, therefore, trust one another, trust our leaders and trust our shared identity so as to build a brighter future together. Sir, I beg to move. [Applause.]Question proposed. Mr Speaker: Mr Seah Kian Peng.',\n",
       " 'Mr Speaker, Sir, the President has asked us to broaden the way we conceive of \"merit\", which is another way of saying \"who deserves what\" in terms of opportunity and access to finite resources.Today, it has become fashionable to hammer this word \"meritocracy\", as if those of us who use it do not know it was originally coined as criticism. Michael Young, the British sociologist, in 1958, argued that a system that rewarded merit defined as \"IQ plus effort\" is as flawed as that one rewarding accidents of birth, because having cognitive ability is as much a matter of genetic lottery.This is true, except we may prefer to adopt this system, compensate for its shortcomings rather than adopt the alternatives which are random assignment, other criteria such as money, power or birth.Let me give you the Singaporean rendering of meritocracy which should be seen against our general governance model.In 1971, then-Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew gave a famous speech about 300 people in a jumbo jet. Most of us remember that speech for the graphic image of the jet crashing and a country bereft of leadership. But the main idea for me is this, how did these people get on the plane?Mr Lee said at the time, and I quote, \"The main burden of present planning and implementation rests on the shoulders of some 300 key persons.\" He goes on to say, \"Outstanding men in civil service, the Police, the armed forces, chairmen of statutory boards and their top administrators.\" And then, he goes on to say, \"These people come from poor and middle-class homes. They come from different language schools. Singapore is a meritocracy. And these men have risen to the top by their own merit, hard work and high performance. Together they are a closely knit and co-ordinated hard core. If all the 300 were to crash in one jumbo jet, then Singapore will disintegrate. That shows how small the base is for our leadership.\"This idea that a man comes into leadership, or indeed, into any position of opportunity, by what he can do, how hard he has worked, the stuff he himself is made of, not who his father was, who his friends are, or how much money he has. This idea that one looks at a man and not his pedigree is as old as Plato\\'s Republic and the Chinese Imperial Examinations. In Singapore, this must remain the only way to get on that jet.The fly in this ointment, of course, is that the two are not unrelated. How much a man is, determines how many advantages his son or daughter has, who this son marries, and in turn, the kinds of privilege he confers on his own offsprings. And so on unto generations to come.In Singapore, there are people who are born into HDB rental blocks that their parents live in, as well as those who inherit good class bungalows (GCBs) that their parents may themselves inherit. The Government can make sure that both have a roof over their heads, they have vaccinations in the clinics, that the sons of the rich serve alongside those of the poor in National Service, but there is no way that the first can afford everything that the second does.We talk often of income inequality and that is indeed an issue. But what I want today to speak about is wealth, because that is an even more glaring offence to the meritocratic ideal. There are 2,700 billionaires in the world – their money comes, not only from their income from work but also through their ownership of capital – property, stocks and the businesses that they owned.We could reset the game after each round – tax bequests heavily so as to erode the advantages of inherited wealth – but there are two constraints on this: the first is to recognise the ancient instinct which urges us to strive so as to be able to leave something for our family as our legacy; the second is a practical benchmark – that Singapore must set tax regimes for the rich, with an eye on the rates in the rest of the world, rather than merely responding to local pressures.Having said this, I do think that we can tax the rich further, especially in specific expenditures such as, super cars. I asked this in my Budget debate speech and I ask the Finance Minister, at some point again, to consider a separate category of Certificates of Entitlement (COEs) for super cars costing over a million dollars. The billionaires should compete among themselves so as not to allow the state to benefit from their preferences for luxury goods. The same goes for the tax for GCBs, country club transfer fees and so on.Net worth is not net income, and it is the first which may be a stronger force for fracture. My second point on inherited wealth is to ask for some data. The data on the Gini coefficient is clear. After adjusting for Government transfers and taxes, the Gini coefficient fell from 0.437 in 2021 to 0.378 in 2022, the second lowest on record. It is a sign that Government transfers are a good way to reduce income inequalities.But the Gini coefficient includes only wage income. It does not take into account capital income which is likely to be more uneven in distribution. I do not know what the wealth distribution is in Singapore, but the Government may consider releasing some data so as to help public discussion.I am not asking for a segregation of the super-rich in terms of everyday life, merely in tax regimes, as a matter of fairness. They are, of course, still free to enjoy $4 or $5 wanton mee at one of my coffeeshops at Serangoon Central. We need to keep common spaces open because these are, after all, financed by tax dollars.The second piece of the puzzle is, therefore, the redistributive function of the state. In order to keep us from fracturing along the lines of inherited wealth, we must also level the playing field for those who are not unto the manner born. In health, education and housing, as well as some elements of transport and financial planning, we must create a minimum standard of living for all Singaporeans.I would like to suggest one radical idea: the top 40% of each cohort already have access to state resources in the form of higher education. The budget of our top two universities here run to billions of dollars a year, with high resources inside the classrooms, the best labs, professors; and outside: with overseas travel, mental health and wellness and a close network of mentors.What about the rest of the other 60%? Can we think of some educational spending or resourcing for the 60%? Whether in terms of skills, continuous training, micro-credentials, or even the sort of non-academic opportunities, including sports, which Mr Murali has talked about, that Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) affords to their students? This latter could include opportunities in the arts, sports as well as access to community service and overseas exposure.Our SkillsFuture Credit framework that we have is good, but I think it should be further institutionalised with additional resources targeted for this 60% group. Singapore would then truly be a home which provides higher and lifelong education for all.Five years ago, in 2018, also in response to the President\\'s Address then, I had said that we must make sure that a boy born to poor parents must have more from the state than one born from the rich. This aggressive redistribution, which is a hallmark of Singapore\\'s socialism, must become even stronger and not just in fiscal policy, but in public censure of any pretence to social class.In this, I refer to the most recent incident where the resident of a condominium mocked, humiliated and ridiculed a security guard for clamping the wheels of his car. His utterance – flaunting his wealth, his contempt for the guard is abhorrent and has no place in Singapore. There are some things that money cannot buy and in Singapore, this includes the price of insult and derogation of any man doing an honest job.We have in 60 years indeed, gone from mudflats to metropolis and may now have a different level of wealth and income but we must not stand for those who think money buys access to a different class.In our schools, in our army camps, in this House of Parliament, we stand or fall as one.Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been a Member of this House since 2006 and it has been a true privilege to stand alongside my colleagues of all political colours. Our jumbo jet may be a lot bigger today, but entry is still by merit and there is still just one class.Today, as in 1971, we are still flying the same flag, with the same five stars: democracy, progress, peace, justice and equality. Today, the success of Singapore lies not within the few in a jet, but in the multitude of ideas in many people who live and work on this island.In 1971, Mr Lee was speaking of unity and the need for all Singaporeans to feel that we are, at the root of our identity, one people. At that time, his fight was to avoid being torn under and along racial lines.At that time, a Malay newspaper had been advocating \"bumiputera\" policies. One Chinese newspaper, on the other hand, has been playing up pro-Chinese Communist news. The English press at the time had been pushing for \"more permissiveness in sex and drugs and worked up a campaign against National Service.\"In 1971, the way towards unity was to build common ground in a common language and culture, and a stake in a prospering country.Today, we may all speak a common language, our schools all teach in English and the power of different language newspapers may have weakened. But we still face provocations, falsehoods, dissension sown and manufactured, and we still face a world who has no interest in the success of Singapore.Aside from the fault lines I spoke of earlier, there are other challenges: foreign and other malign influences through social media, the rise of a victimhood culture where each special group stand on its rights and sees \"micro aggressions\", where subjective feeling and \"lived experiences\" take priority over objective truths and rational discourse.And as Singapore ages, the demands for state resources for older Singaporeans will rise, we can expect rising resentment among the young. In 2017, Greece and Italy spent around 15.5% of GDP on public pensions; Austria, France and Portugal spend around 13% to 14% of GDP. The entire Singapore budget is only about 18% today. So, this is a serious issue which we must tackle.The challenges today are as numerous as ever. It seems it is the fate of a small nation, to always strive lest we fall. This can exhaust and frighten, or it can inspire and energise. The choice is ours, all of us who have chosen to fly this jet together. Sir, I support the Motion.Mr Speaker: Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.',\n",
       " 'Imagine for a moment, if you will, being a teenager again. The awkward parties, the search for self, the facial breakouts. But one of the feelings that many of us will find inextricably linked to our adolescent years is one of exclusion. Now imagine the same feeling, only that you are now supposed to be a fully functioning, fully participating adult in society.Mr Speaker, Singaporean incomes present themselves as somewhat of an enigma.By some measures, we are among the richest countries in the world. Measured in terms of a common currency, Singapore comes in at fifth in 2022, ahead of Qatar and the United States (US), and just shy of Switzerland. When adjusted for actual purchasing power, we climb even higher; to third, just behind Ireland and Luxembourg, two European countries often used as tax shelters.But amid this wealth, we also see sharply dissonant scenes of the elderly picking up cardboard, selling tissue packs, or clearing plates at hawker centers, of an underclass of workers who live in dingy, overcrowded rental flats and rely on food handouts, of people who quip that in Singapore, you can be poor, or you can be sick, or you can die, but you cannot stop working.In her address last week, Mdm Halimah urged us to improve our social compact and strengthen our social safety net, emphasising how, I quote, \"the fruits of progress must be shared fairly.\"I support the President\\'s sentiment and the Motion, but in this speech, I will speak more about the apparent economic success declared by the headline numbers versus the economic precarity felt by a large group of Singaporeans. I will go on to discuss hard living in Singapore, especially after the pandemic, before concluding with proposals that can help us hopefully improve the circumstances of those who are struggling the most.Living in Singapore is not cheap. Look around. The market price of a 4-room HDB flat – all 970 square feet of it – ranges from $460,000 in Jurong East to a whopping $860,000 in Queenstown. Sengkang, the district I represent, recently saw a flat change hands for close to $1 million dollars. And island wide, close to a dozen 4-room flats sold for more than $1 million-dollar mark in the first quarter. Observers expect this trend to persist.The cost of a new Japanese sedan, like the Honda Civic that I drive, is $180,000, around five times the price of what it goes for in other advanced economies. Put another way, buying a car would cost close to three years\\' salary of a typical middle-income individual here, compared to around 14 months in the US.Our decades-old aspiration toward Swiss standards of living has, alas, also brought with it Swiss-style prices. Reports routinely place Singapore, tied with New York, as the most expensive city to live in in the world. While this Government has argued that such metrics do not reflect the typical experience of a Singaporean household who consume different things and have access to taxpayer-funded grants and subsidies for big-ticket items like purchasing an HDB flat, the sting is that many of these things the rest of the world deem affordable is, for us, not.That said, by some measures, Singapore is eminently affordable, at least when compared to other advanced economies. Delicious hawker meals, which we rightly celebrate as a part of our natural, intangible heritage, can be had for a few dollars, plus a dollar more if you happen to live in Sengkang.Our public transportation system is excellent and many of us commute on it on a day-to-day basis by paying relatively affordable, albeit rising, fares. Most of us are able to send our kids to school without the need to resort to expensive private schooling that would break the bank.Whence the discrepancy? It stems from the fact that for those among us that do not own or have access to capital, life is exceedingly hard. It is one of working long hours but barely getting by, of living out each day with little hope for the future, of seeing the enormous prosperity that our country has achieved but feeling that, somehow, this has mostly passed you by.But for those of us who own assets like stocks and bonds, who run or inherited a business, or were fortunate enough to get on the housing ladder early on, it is possible to enjoy the fruits of this wealth and rely on high-asset prices to cushion the effects of high prices of goods and services.Moreover, the challenges of the poor would likely have been compounded by the pandemic. Across the globe, economically vulnerable households have tended to fare poorly as a result of the COVID-19 shock. Detailed surveys from economies, both Western and Eastern, suggest lower-income groups experienced greater job market losses. In Singapore, two separate studies by DBS on account balances revealed that close to half of lower-income groups suffered significant falls in income, with around half within that group experiencing drops of more than 50% and had less than a month of emergency funds available.This may seem especially unfair, since the less well-off were often our essential workers and had to continue on in the frontlines, even as the rest of us sheltered comfortably at home. Unfortunately, the poor did not find much relief after the pandemic. Inflation hit hard, reaching peaks of 7.5% in August and September last year. While this has come down, inflation, in excess of 6%, continues to eat away at incomes.A more recent survey by DBS found that wage increases have failed to keep up with inflation and for the lowest income group, expenses have grown close to five-and-a-half times faster than their salaries. Even by the Government\\'s own statistics, household real wages decreased in 2020 and 2021, and the small increase last year does not fully make up for the losses.In contrast, there are those of us who have been lucky enough to have sufficient savings to invest and, in some cases, have been able to tap on higher interest rates offered by the market to shore up our finances. But such discrepancies only serve to further exacerbate the discrepancy between the wealthy and the rest.Researchers who have devoted their lives to studying poverty tend to believe that its causes may be broadly defined into two groups. The first argues that low incomes constrain the ability of the poor to save, eat well and pursue educational opportunities. Since poverty causes poverty, the solution is to offer one-off transfers that help the poor extricate themselves from their plight. A second group believes that the poor are limited by their God-given abilities, talents or motivation, and they will always be among us and the solution is to provide small, but repeated, income support.I believe that there is merit to both these perspectives on poverty. Inasmuch as we want to offer opportunities for those of us to escape the poverty trap, the basis of most of the Government\\'s anti-poverty policies, there are those that happen to be endowed with less potential, stricken by physical or mental disability, or who face persistent discrimination, and hence, require the support of society-at-large. And in a rich, advanced economy, I believe that doing so is the correct and compassionate thing to do.Regardless of which school of thought one subscribes to, the fact remains that if we are to help the poor, we must know who they are. But in Singapore, we have yet to establish an official poverty line. This is both puzzling and exasperating. We take pride in ourselves as people who are quantitatively sophisticated and highly efficient; we make and meet KPIs. Targeting the poor is impossible, or at least, imperfect, without an official, transparent benchmark.We have, instead, a confusing mishmash of thresholds that have been applied by different agencies at different times. We sometimes see reports for the lowest quartile, or quintile, being treated as the poor, or simply the halving of median household incomes. The HDB income threshold for rental happens to be $1,500, while the ComCare threshold is closer to $1,900. The Department of Statistics instead pegs the Average Household Expenditure on Basic Needs at $1,250, albeit this low figure was from two surveys ago and the calculation does not seem to have been updated.Other unofficial lines, based on ensuring social inclusion or allowing for relative, not just absolute, poverty would suggest higher amounts. These range from $2,500, to as much as $6,400. One may quibble with these numbers and this Government has certainly done so, by arguing that the high-end estimates overstate what are needs versus wants in the household.A poverty line is defined as the lowest income level that would be deemed adequate in a given country. This leaves a tremendous amount of latitude in terms of what is \"adequate\". What may be regarded as an absolute minimum necessary to purchase goods and services for basic needs in a poor country may be shockingly low, when set against expectations of needs in a rich country. Indeed, there is clear evidence that as countries get richer, the value of what is conventionally regarded as a basic need changes.And the fact is, we are no longer a developing country. The sort of things that we need to be as a full participant in Singaporean society has changed. Smartphones may seem like an unnecessary perk to some, but without one, many basic Government services become increasingly difficult to access. A holiday may strike others as a luxury, but for large families cooped up in tiny apartments, a brief getaway to Malaysia offers an important respite that can ensure the mental health of parents.And money spent on \"ang pows\" and gifts and celebrations are not just frivolous spending; they represent rites of passage and acts of reciprocity that speak to a moral economy and societal norm, which cannot be reduced to dollars and cents.It is, in my view, an insult to suggest to a family that the supplemental tuition that their struggling kids need to stay afloat in our overcrowded classrooms is not sufficiently \"basic.\" Or that spending on deodorant in our hot and humid climate, particularly before an interview or a big date, is truly \"discretionary\".Part of the problem is a disconnect between what this Government has claimed to be basic, versus what Singaporeans themselves perceive as necessary for human flourishing. But if we can all agree that a good life includes opportunities to education and decent healthcare, employment with work-life balance and a sense of inclusion when one participates in social, cultural and religious activities, then why do we not extend these to the most economically vulnerable in our midst? Life is not just about making it day-to-day, but about thriving, as all humans, poor or not, have aspirations.It is time for an official poverty line. This line should be established based on components that go beyond just the crude, \"basic\" needs of housing, food and clothing. Set up a committee, with representatives, from not just MSF, but also leaders from civil society and experts from academia, to figure out what this should be. Then, peg all thresholds for Government assistance, especially ComCare, to this line or higher, but never lower. The Local Qualifying Salary, effectively our minimum wage for Singaporeans should likewise be tied to this line.Even after we have established a new threshold for ComCare, we need to recognise that the system can stand to be refined. At this year\\'s COS debate, I suggested that the ComCare approval process can be intrusive, onerous and demeaning. While I agree with the general principle of being responsible with public monies, we should not become overzealous in the opposite direction.It is tempting to design a public welfare system that attempts to sieve out only those that we deem \"worthy\" of support. So-called \"welfare kings or queens\" should be excluded as such individuals undeniably exist. We may even have some \"regulars\" in our Meet-the-People Sessions, but they are few and far between.Most of my residents possess a lot of self respect and feel uncomfortable seeking help from the state, even when they are going through a tough situation not of their own making. A system that is stingy about financial assistance to the eight or nine folks that just want a little bit of support in a particularly trying time, just to deny the one or two abusers, strikes me as excessive and especially since all that effort translates only to a modest payout.Furthermore, support is often granted for an unbearably short time – three to six months in the first instance. With precious few exceptions, how can someone\\'s lot improve in just three months? Even when we make appeals and reappeals to agencies, such as the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA), we are often told that we should wait for six months before trying again, since life circumstances are unlikely to change much in the interim. And even if they did, providing some additional months of support would help those who are in need partially fill up the hole that they find themselves in.As my hon friend Mr Leon Perera has argued in this House, poverty imposes a non-trivial \"bandwidth tax\": the cognitive burden of poverty, in and of itself. Being in dire financial straits not only imposes mental stress as one searches for job opportunities; it can affect our handling of all-important job interviews, or our performance in a job during the probation period. It steals mental resources that are better spent on improving our situation or providing care for our dependants. It even reduces the little pleasure we receive from what we are able to consume.Think back on the last time when you had a tight budget before your next paycheck came in and how you had to worry about whether you could make the rent or the mortgage, pay for your meals next week or clear bills that would keep the lights on. Play out that exercise every single day and week, and you will sense what it is like to be poor. Layer on that, the need to \"prove\" that you are indeed poor every few months to a Social Service Office (SSO) officer, who has the power to snatch away the fragile lifeline that you have.We can reduce the need for such burdensome and intrusive pre-approval scrutiny by obtaining many documents directly from our public and semi-public agencies, such as rental or utilities. We can deploy conditional cash transfers (CCTs) in exchange for desired behaviour, such as supplementary educational expenses or preventative healthcare spending, and use the fulfilment of the condition as sufficient evidence to qualify for support.We could set the default that automatically qualifies all Singaporeans in rental flats for an extended period in the Fresh Start home ownership programme, as recently suggested by a local social sector leader.The Government might argue that beyond ComCare, there is the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS), our other key anti-poverty programme, that is also aligned with incentives. But, as I suggested before, not everyone who is poor is able to work and even when they can, circumstances might constrain how much they can.The WIS is based on an earned income tax credit (EITC) which, in turn, is a refinement of the negative income tax. Without going into technical details, it is sufficient to note that our scheme tends to be viewed more as a grudgingly offered financial supplement, conditional on one putting in sufficient work hours, rather than a genuine anti-poverty tool aimed at helping provide additional support to our low-income earners.This is in part because the amounts offered by the WIS are paltry, majority of which is not even accessible for meeting daily needs, since most of it goes straight to the Central Provident Fund (CPF). Even with the most recent revision, topped-up amounts come to $350 a month at best, and can be as little as half that.While any additional help is undoubtedly welcome, I have had many residents share that the support hardly makes a dent in high cost Singapore. This is exacerbated by our low-income thresholds – $3,000 a year – before one is disqualified. In contrast, the maximum income for the US programme is closer to twice that.The $500 minimum monthly income requirement introduced last year may also inadvertently exclude workers who are most in need of the flexibility afforded by our part-time employment. While the ostensible reason for the requirement is to exclude some of the more well-off families from benefiting from the programme, it seems like the more tried and tested tool – total household or spousal income or the annual value (AV) of one\\'s residential property – would be sufficient to rule out the non-poor. Indeed, while we are reassured that those who are already on ComCare would automatically receive Workfare, I am sure that we are aware of many poor families, who for various reasons, are not on ComCare – perhaps because of the onerous documentary criteria I mentioned earlier or if they happen to have an estranged child who is also a high-income earner.Were these individuals to work only limited hours, perhaps due to health or age, the limited additional support Workfare promises would nevertheless not be available to them.Workfare also seems to be blind to the differential needs of parents with children. The WIS, to put it bluntly, is independent of dependants. This is in contrast to the approach in other jurisdictions where support is significantly higher if the household has one or more children. This approach makes absolute sense, since parents not only have more dependants to support, they also need to make arrangements for childcare were they to enter into the workforce formally.Finally, Sir, it is worth pointing out that there are age conditions associated with the WIS, where those who are younger receive less support than the elderly. But this is curious. Why would the youthful poor necessarily need less money than the elderly?This becomes more odd when —Mr Speaker: Mr Lim, you have half a minute left.',\n",

       " 'Mr Speaker, Singapore’s Independence was a product of the post-war decolonialisation wave, that started in the late 1940s with the independence of India. That was also the period that saw the birth of the United Nations (UN), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank (WB) and, in later years, the World Trade Organization (WTO).These organisations formed the backbone of the modern multilateral world we live in. Common values recognised in international law included the recognition of the sovereignty of nations and the prohibition against the use of force except in self defence.With the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the WTO, trade among nations grew and the world became more interconnected. This was a backdrop that was conducive to Singapore’s growth as a small nation since the rule of law is especially important for protecting the small and the vulnerable.The last few years have seen an unprecedented retreat from multilateralism. Russia’s attack on Ukraine was a breach of the UN Charter and the prohibition against the use of force. However, Russia, through its predecessor state, the USSR, is also a charter member of the UN with a veto in the security council. The breach of the UN Charter by a charter member is worrying for the rule of law and it is important for the rest of the world to take a firm stand on this if we intend to maintain the rule of law.Two of the biggest beneficiaries of the liberalisation of trade following GATT and the WTO are the US and China. They are now the two biggest economies in the world. Yet, the rivalry between the two is now threatening the system on which both prospered. Other countries are also taking their cue from the superpowers, and we see increasing calls for protectionism from different countries. In the long run, this is likely to create more silos and a divided world.The multilateral system is not dead, but I think it is important for those that believe in its importance to continue to speak up for it and help bring in those who are sceptical. The source of the scepticism is that free trade has sometimes exaggerated the differences between the rich and the poor in different countries. As jobs and roles move to different countries, there will inevitably be winners and losers at home. For those who believe in multilateralism, I think it is important for us to acknowledge some of these side effects and then have domestic policies that correct for this. I think the multilateral system has benefits for everyone, not least of which is greater security. And in this testing time, we need to win back as many of the sceptics as we can. Singapore itself has not been immune to some of these effects and this leads me to the second area I wish to address in my speech. The President’s Address acknowledged the importance of Singapore continuing to grow, but that these opportunities must be shared equitably.I believe this is fundamental to preserving our society where everyone has opportunities.Singapore’s growth over the years has been remarkable and, as we moved from third world to first, the living standards of almost all our people improved dramatically. However, now that we are a developed country and our GDP per capita is among the highest in the world, continuing to be a growing high-income country is more difficult. We need to find better, higher-paying jobs for our citizens.At the same time, with higher incomes all round, the cost of living is generally higher as higher incomes for citizens translates into higher costs for wages for businesses and higher rentals as people pay more and compete for the real estate. Additionally, global inflationary pressures and higher interest rates also add to pressures in the cost of living for Singaporeans.Against this backdrop, I think the measures in the President’s Address to ensure that Singaporeans continue to have opportunities to train and get employment throughout their working lives is vital. I would also suggest that this be coupled with income support while people undergo training. This should be enough to tide them over temporary rough patches.Going to an earlier stage, I think it is important for our schools to remain the great leveller for education. In the past, children would attend school and learn things like the alphabet from there. I recall entering Primary 1 without any knowledge of how to read or write Tamil, but it was still possible to learn from scratch.Now, with most children having preschool education, the entry benchmark has risen and basic literacy and numeracy is required for children attending Primary 1, failing which, more may fall behind. This means those who miss preschool, who are predominantly from lower-income families, will start off on the back foot. It is therefore even more important to ensure that preschool is attended by all children and either make this compulsory or have strong measures in place to encourage universal attendance.The next matter, which I think has been alluded to by some of the earlier speakers, is the proliferation of tuition, even after children attend school. Parents across all income groups try their best to supplement what their children learn in school with tuition. In HDB heartland malls, an increasingly larger footprint is being used for such services.While such services are helpful for children, there is a concern by parents who cannot afford such services that their children may lose out. I have some parents who come to MPS to seek assistance when they are going through a rough patch and they often indicate their children’s tuition expenses are part of their normal monthly expenditures. Of course, MSF rarely gives financial assistance to cope with such expenses.There are other self-help groups that come in to provide support for this but it will be good if we can develop a system that places less emphasis on tuition. Education in our schools is highly affordable and of a very high quality. It is important that parents believe such education is adequate for their children and that children who are unable to attend or afford tuition and enrichment classes do not get left behind. This is an important part of keeping our playing field open for children of all backgrounds to thrive.(In Tamil): [Please refer to Vernacular Speech.] The reopening of Parliament this time coincides with the Tamil Language Festival. This year there are 42 events being organised by a range of different organisations. This event receives strong but quiet support from the Government, which through the Tamil Language Council, provides grants for the organisation of events at this festival.I am grateful to the Government for its strong support for the Tamil language in Singapore. The Tamil speaking community makes up around 5% of our population and it is one of Singapore’s official languages. The Government supports the language in many ways.The Tamil Language Council supports the Tamil Language Festival.Another committee, the Tamil Language Learning and Promotion Committee, otherwise known as TLLPC – which I have chaired for several years – offers support for the learning of Tamil outside of classrooms. The TLLPC team organises events and supports activities throughout the year to make the use and learning of Tamil language fun.Grants are also given for the production of local Tamil content by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) under its Public Service Broadcast Programme and this allows for the creation of good quality local content, which is monitored by the Indian Programme Advisory Committee.This support is commendable and has helped the Tamil language remain a vibrant language in Singapore.Tamil is now also widely offered across more schools. When I was in preschool in the 1980s, it would have been very difficult to find preschools offering Tamil as a second language. When my father was in primary school in the 1950s, he started studying Tamil in Primary 1, but had to drop it in Primary 3 when his teacher passed away and no replacement could be found. He then had to switch to the Malay language. We have come a long way from those days, with Tamil now available across many preschools and government schools. One issue that has arisen now though is the shortage of Tamil teachers in schools. As the number of Tamil students are small, there are fewer Tamil teachers than for other Mother Tongue languages. However, even though the number of children is small, the Tamil children in schools still have a variety of different needs, including children across different age groups and with different subject-based banding.Yet, because of the shortage of teachers, I understand some schools have been forced to combine Tamil classes with children in different subject-based bands coming together for the same class. This makes common teaching difficult. It will be helpful to know if the Ministry of Education (MOE) has any plans to deal with this issue. This may include plans on how we may develop a larger pipeline of Tamil teachers for our Government schools and preschools. The learning of Tamil in Singapore has come a long way, with quiet support from the Government going a long way. I am grateful for this support and hope it will continue.Mr Speaker: Mr Gerald Giam.',\n",
       " 'Mr Speaker, in her address to Parliament, the President called for a “broader and more open meritocracy that works well for all Singaporeans”. A lynchpin of our system of meritocracy is our education system, which is the subject of my speech today. Singapore’s education system has gone through several changes over the years, from the introduction of streaming in 1981, to the introduction of Subject-based Banding (SBB) in 2014, to the roll out of Full SBB starting in 2020. Yet, even with these changes, one major feature of our education system remains central – examinations.  As a parent of two children who have gone through PSLE and are now in secondary school, I am rather familiar with both the joy and – more often – the frustration that parents go through when helping their children through major national examinations.  Tutoring my own children has also provided me insights into the academic curriculum and its continued focus on examinations. I remember spending an inordinate amount of time working with my children through assessment books and past examination papers. I would often have to peek at the answer sheets behind, so I could teach them how to answer science questions with just the right number of points while putting up with taunts from my own offspring, which went along the lines of, “See, you also don’t know!”  I would also have to repeatedly drill my children on mathematics problem sums. To get a good pass in Singapore’s examinations, students need to not only answer questions correctly, but also quickly, or risk the “horror” of having many unanswered questions at the end of the paper, due to examination time limits.  Many mid-year examinations have been done away with, but these have been replaced with weighted assessments which occur throughout the school year. The major national examinations like the PSLE, \"N\", \"O\" and \"A\" levels always loom just around the corner. Perform poorly in any of these examinations and the students will find their future educational options narrowed down or delayed – a prospect that many students and parents fear, no matter what the Government says about the many pathways to success.  There are positive effects of examinations. They can incentivise teachers to cover their subjects more thoroughly, a skill which our local educators excel in. Examinations motivate students to work harder to gain a sense of accomplishment.   However, there are also negative effects of examinations. They can motivate students to aim for test mastery instead of subject mastery. Tests encourage teachers to narrow the curriculum and lose instructional time, which could lead to “teaching to the test”.  Examinations, typically, assess only certain aspects of a learner\\'s knowledge, potentially overlooking other aspects of their education. Examination outcomes may not be definitive since they are solely based on a student\\'s performance on the examination day. If a student is unwell or performs poorly under stress, it could adversely affect their examination results and their scores may not be an accurate reflection of their grasp of the subject matter. If the student fails to achieve their desired examination results, they will have to settle for courses of study in secondary schools or tertiary institutions that they may not be so inclined towards.  National examinations induce tremendous amounts of stress on students, as they determine their future educational pathways and, consequently, their future careers and earning potential. While it can be argued that it is good for young people to learn to cope with stress, when stress becomes toxic, it can have negative effects on learning and knowledge retention and, in extreme situations, could become chronic.  By channelling their energies into preparing for examinations, students may forgo opportunities to experience the joy of learning and achieving mastery in what really is important for life. The streaming approach puts students through a standardised test like the PSLE, sorted them into good, average and weak students, and put them on different education streams in secondary schools with different subject combinations based on their test scores. The new Subject-based Banding approach also sorts students into good, average and weak students for each subject, and channels them into subject combinations based on their assessed ability in each subject.  While subject-based banding is less rigid than streaming, it is still based on the same principle. A student has to meet a specific test score in order to study the subjects they are interested in.  The ostensible reason for implementing this sorting mechanism is to provide some assurance that the student can cope with the rigours of that subject or subject level before being allowed to take it. This is probably why through-train programmes are currently available mainly to an elite few students who qualify for the Integrated Programme by virtue of their stellar performance in the PSLE. There is little risk that these students will become early dropouts of school. In contrast, the Workers’ Party has proposed a 10-year through-train programme from Primary 1 to Secondary 4 as an option for parents who want their child to bypass the PSLE. Our proposed through-train programme gives students 10 years to prepare for their first major examination at Secondary 4, allowing them to learn at a pace suited for them while developing other areas of interest. The 10-year through-train programme will pair up existing primary and secondary schools and complement, not replace, the non-through-train tracks in these schools. My hon friend, Assoc Prof Jamus Lim, elaborated on this proposal in detail during the COS debate earlier this year.   We need to make our education system less of a sorting mechanism for identifying students’ abilities and more of a launchpad for students to discover their strengths and interests and develop deep skills in their areas of interest.  Students should not be channelled away from their interests just because they did not obtain a certain cut-off point in their examinations. There might be concerns that some so-called “kiasu parents” will push their children to take subjects that are far beyond their abilities. However, I believe that most Singaporean students and their parents are keenly aware of their own limitations and will not bite off more than they can chew. After all, if a student takes a subject at too challenging a level, they will have difficulty scoring the much coveted \"A1\"s in national examinations.  I would now like to move on to another aspect of education which needs more focus in Singapore – financial literacy.  Singapore is a major financial hub, with numerous global, regional and local institutional investors and high-net-worth family offices based here. Billions of investment funds are raised and managed in Singapore.   Yet, Singaporeans generally lack the financial know-how and confidence to manage their own personal finances and plan for their future. In a private sector survey in 2022, more than half of Singaporeans considered themselves “financially illiterate”. The same survey showed that financial literacy is the lowest among the age group of 18 to 24, at only 35%. In the MoneySENSE National Financial Capability Survey 2021, four in 10 respondents said they lacked knowledge of basic financial concepts, such as risk diversification and simple and compound interest, and more than half had not developed a retirement plan.   MoneySENSE is Singapore’s national financial education programme. In the two decades since it was started, it has launched various programmes and provided resources to help Singaporeans better manage their finances. However, the programmes seem to be mostly ad hoc and campaign-driven. Various surveys have been conducted on financial literacy among Singaporeans since its launch, but it is not clear how much the financial literacy of Singaporeans has improved over the last two decades, as these surveys do not seem to have followed the same scope or framework.  Based on the results of the recent surveys, it appears that a lot more needs to be done to enhance Singaporeans’ financial capacity and literacy. And instead of doing more, it appears that some co-funding of financial literacy workshops for schools under MoneySENSE has been discontinued.  For a developed country, with such high educational, wealth and income levels, and an established status as a leading international financial hub, the survey results show worrying statistics about the financial literacy rate in Singapore. To improve our financial resilience as a nation, there is a need to plug the current financial literacy gap among Singaporeans and empower Singaporeans with the knowledge and confidence to take greater ownership of their financial well-being.   I would like to share three suggestions to systematically uplift the financial literacy of Singaporeans and empower them with the knowledge and confidence to manage their own financial health.  First of all, I would like to suggest that the Government develop a National Financial Literacy Framework to provide a systematic basis for benchmarking improvements in financial literacy levels over time. In the Financial Literacy Survey conducted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in 2005, a scoring system was mooted, covering both knowledge and action. However, it appears that the scoring system was discontinued in subsequent surveys. Aggregate financial literacy statistics of Singaporeans should be established, measured and tracked as part of ascertaining Singapore’s financial resilience.  Second, I would like to suggest that the Government establish a National Financial Education Programme under MOE to provide proactive and comprehensive financial education for Singaporeans across all ages.   I note that the Minister for Education had mentioned previously that financial literacy is infused into subjects such as Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), and that the Student Learning Space provides self-paced lessons for students to learn financial literacy. However, I believe financial literacy is such a critical subject matter that we should not adopt a “by-the-way” approach.   Instead, we should equip Singaporeans across all ages with deeper financial knowledge and confidence. This should include not just MoneySENSE’s Tier 1 knowledge of basic money management but should also aim to significantly improve Singaporeans’ financial capacity in Tier 2, which is financial planning, and Tier 3, investment knowhow.  Financial literacy should be included as a standalone subject taught in schools, as good financial habits need to be started from young. It does not need to be an examinable subject. Financial literacy clubs can be included as a co-curricular activity across all schools. These clubs can also be set up at all community and SAFRA clubs, with structured activities.  Third, the concentration of household wealth in residential property assets needs to be addressed to give Singaporeans the financial freedom to explore other asset classes for their retirement planning in order to achieve better diversification and improve returns on their assets.   According to the Department of Statistics, almost half of Singapore’s household wealth is in residential property assets. A DBS report has indicated that property will no longer be the best retirement investment in Singapore in the future. Having half of Singaporeans’ wealth in a single, relatively illiquid asset is a financial risk. Contrary to the common perception, other asset classes have also generated returns comparable to Singapore\\'s residential real estate, even in the Singapore property boom period, especially after factoring in costs related to holding and transacting properties.  As I had mentioned in my speech on the Motions on public housing in February, we need to moderate the growth in housing prices and ensure they do not outpace Singapore’s economic growth. It is unlikely that Singapore’s economic growth will be anywhere close to what was achieved in the past few decades. Therefore, it is also unlikely that, moving forward, Singaporeans’ residential property assets can deliver a level of returns similar to what was previously achieved, without causing undue inflationary pressures.   Equipping Singaporeans with better financial literacy will help them to become willing to have a more diversified asset portfolio and make more sound decisions while doing so, taking into consideration their risk profile and circumstances. This could, in turn, better secure Singaporeans’ retirement adequacy.  Mr Speaker, in summary, our education system should provide more opportunities for our students to pursue their interests as long as they have demonstrated their commitment and ability to complete the whole course of study. We need to move away from the over-emphasis on preparing for high stakes examinations, and place greater focus on enjoying learning and achieving subject and skills mastery.   Equipping Singaporeans with greater financial knowledge and confidence will enable them to take charge of their financial well-being and make better-informed decisions on their personal finances. Strengthening Singaporeans’ financial resilience will also serve to enhance our overall resilience as a nation.  Finally, Sir, I would like to respond to what the hon Member, Mr Murali Pillai, said in his speech earlier on. Sir, unanimous agreement on both sides of the House is not a prerequisite for national unity. Rational and responsible debate in Parliament that focuses on policies, not personalities, is the way to express our diverse views and improve our policies, with the objective of improving the lives of Singaporeans while remaining united as one people. Sir, I support the Motion. Mr Speaker: Mr Raj Joshua Thomas.',\n",
       " 'Sir, meritocracy is part of the Singapore ethos and is one of the key contributors to our success. It may be defined as a system, organisation or society in which people are chosen for or occupy positions of success, wealth, power and influence on the basis of demonstrated ability and hard work. In other words, it is a system in which there is a promise of reward in recognition of talent and industry.This promise of reward has encouraged many Singaporeans to set ambitious targets for themselves to achieve as best they can in business as well as in the Public Service. This has driven our economy and has also attracted global talent to Singapore who have contributed tremendously to us becoming an international business hub. Meritocracy continues to be relevant, and we should maintain it as Singapore\\'s key societal organising principle. However, our form of meritocracy has also led to unintended consequences. First, professions of the mind have been over-prioritised over professions of the hands and has led to significant differences in renumeration. Second, intergenerational transfers of wealth threaten to create a permanent over-class which gives rise to inequity in access to opportunities. I thank the President for having raised these concerns in her speech. I would like to make some suggestions as to how we could tackle these challenges.First, we should look at recognising the value of the work done by workers who work with their hands or who are in the practical professions. The President specifically raised this. I submit that we should leverage heavily on the existing and any upcoming Progressive Wage Model (PWM) sectors to achieve this. How can this be done? Primarily, the PWM is a wage ladder. In this regard, I would like to encourage the Government, unions and industry to consider accelerating the wage increases of our PWM workers. Raising wages will help to effect the shift in our definition of merit by showing that the work done by these workers, even if not generally considered work of the mind, is also important and will of the reward.For example, cleaners ensure the cleanliness of Singapore which is a distinctively Singaporean characteristic that contributes to our comfort and health and the aesthetics of our country. It is important work and it is often backbreaking work. It is physically intensive. There is no reason why such work should be considered lesser than other work and less deserving of high reward.We should also accelerate job redesign by incentivising employers. One way would be to modify the wage rungs in the existing PWMs such that each has a basic and an enhanced sub-realm. In order to qualify for the enhanced sub-realm, workers must be trained in specific skills, for example, the use of technology. In return, they will be entitled to a higher wage floor within that PWM realm. Employers who hire more of these workers and pay at the higher rates could receive a progressive wage and hence, rung incentive. This will encourage more employers to transform their businesses to upskill their workers and to offer more sophisticated services to their clients.There is already a Progressive Wage Credit Scheme but this payout is across the board for all wage increases. Could we consider tweaking it so that it does not support all wage increases in the PWM sectors equally, but provides more support for the right types of wage increases? This will help to improve our workers not only in terms of what they earn but also redesign their jobs from being largely manual to being higher skilled, uplifting how their jobs are perceived, as well as how they themselves feel about their professions.Next, we can foster changes in mindset towards the practical professions by choosing our nomenclature carefully. Instead of referring to these sectors as low-wage sectors, perhaps, we could consider referring to them as maybe emerging wage sectors or emerging wage workers. The whole purpose of the PWM is to get these workers out of being low-wage earners. But, if on the journey there, we keep referring to them as low-wage workers, we may unwittingly create a stigma that will stick even after we have lifted them from being low wage.Second, I would like to propose that we also create opportunities in our education system for students to be exposed to the practical professions so that they can see and experience the work done by these sectors and learn to appreciate that all work is good work. Perhaps, one day, we will see our students seeking internships or apprenticeships as technicians, arborists or waiters, and not just in law firms and banks.Finally, Sir, as raised by the President, there is a need to address intergenerational wealth accumulation and the formation of a permanent overclass. I would like to suggest that the Government consider introducing a limited inheritance tax by way of a stamp duty tax on inherited real property.Inheritance tax is a form of wealth tax and can be gradated so that it is progressive in nature; that is, the wealthier will be taxed more and would pay more. The raison d\\'etre for this is that the rich presumably benefit more from state resources and also because progressive taxes act as a means to redistribute resources in society.In principle, I do not think that many would dispute the principles behind wealth taxes. However, we must be careful when designing and implementing any form of wealth tax so that we do not undo the features that underpin Singapore\\'s success and prosperity in the first place. We must avoid becoming unattractive as a destination for foreign investment or to disincentivise our people from working hard and aspiring to grow their wealth. In other words, wealth taxes should not diminish the value of merit and should not affect our overall attractiveness as a business hub.Currently, inherited residential property is not taxed and does not even attract stamp duty. The Government can consider introducing a tax based on the percentage of the value of the property and the percentage of tax should be higher the more expensive the property inherited is. The minimum could begin from, say, a property value of S$5 million and gradated upwards from there. Inheritance tax in OECD countries can go as high as 40%. But I would suggest more modest rates, perhaps in line with the additional buyers\\' stamp duties, that can go up to 25% for Singapore Citizens and 35% for foreigners.The tax regime should be able to take into consideration the personal circumstances of beneficiaries and provide appropriate exemptions. There should, for example, be exemptions for beneficiaries with special needs and HDB flats should also be exempted from inheritance taxes – and hopefully, they will not reach that limit of S$5 million anyway!There should also be provision for beneficiaries to be able to pay the tax by instalments over a period of time. Some would argue that some beneficiaries may not be able to afford the tax despite having inherited a multimillion-dollar property. My view is that they should sell the property to make payment of their dues to the Government. There are also mechanisms that an individual may take up, for example, life insurance that can cover any taxes that beneficiaries may have to pay after that individual has passed.Why do I suggest an inheritance tax on property?Inheritance taxes are different from estate duties. Estate duties tax the estate of a deceased person and, in my view, this could be seen as a form of double taxation because the deceased had already paid taxes while alive. In this regard, inheritance is anyway not treated as a gift under the law. It should be treated as a form of income received by the beneficiary and like all income, it should be taxed.The basic principle, Sir, of meritocracy is that one should be rewarded for his capabilities and hard work. Inheritance provides rewards that are not pursuant to capability or hard work. They are unmeritorious rewards that one is entitled to only by virtue of birth and/or bequeathment. It does not stimulate innovation, entrepreneurship or industry. In fact, it entrenches entitlement and it promotes indolence.Although it may be the impulse of parents to wish to provide for their children and to leave a legacy, inheritance, in my view, is a very antithesis of meritocracy. As a Scottish American industrialist, Andrew Carnegie said, \"The parent who leaves his son enormous wealth generally deadens the talents and energies of the son and tempts him to lead a less worthy life than he otherwise would have.\"A large proportion of the wealthy at this point store their wealth in property. And, as a form of investment, it is generally less helpful to society at large than other things of wealth, like capital or shares, which contribute to economic output as well as to employment.Further to this, as for any text, we should also consider whether it would result in onerous administration and whether it is sustainable. Taxes on inherited real property are relatively easy to administer as valuation is straightforward and, in Singapore, transfer processes are transparent. It is therefore the lowest hanging fruit to promote equity and fairness and fair access to opportunities across generations based on merit. Introducing such a tax may have a collateral benefit of lowering property prices by easing house price inflation and properties being put up for sale that may not have otherwise come up on the market.This having been said, there are many serious considerations in whether it is appropriate to implement wealth and inheritance taxes. It is not something that we should rush into because it may itself have unintended consequences. But as the President said, as we prosper as a society, those who have already done well will seek to pass their advantages to their children, and this could lead to advantages and privileges becoming entrenched and persisting over generations. Inheritance taxes are one measure we could consider implementing to battle this.I do not think that we should seek to build a classless society or that children should not be allowed to benefit from their parents\\' hard work. What we should aim to build is an inclusive society where capabilities and hard work in every sector are recognised and rewarded, and where, even when one attains success, he does not feel that he has become superior or be given the right to look down on others but feels responsibility to help others to advance as well.We must also take steps to prevent an entrenched overclass from forming by rich families building wealth over generations and scions benefiting from nothing but the hard work of their forebears. All must feel the need to work hard in Singapore in order to earn our rewards. We must act on this; for if we do not, we risk descending from a meritocracy to an aristocracy and that, Sir, is what we must avoid at all costs.Mr Speaker: Minister of State Desmond Tan.',\n",
       " 'Mr Speaker, Sir, the Labour Movement supports the broad directions of the Government set out in the President\\'s Address. Underpinning these is the strong foundation of trust that was demonstrated and strengthened through our shared experience during the COVID-19 pandemic.  In the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), our vision is for \"a better and more meaningful life where workers of all collars, ages and nationalities can work, live and play together in Singapore.\" And we achieve this through Singapore\\'s unique brand of tripartism in which the Labour Movement stands shoulder to shoulder with our partners towards the shared objective of growing the economy, to secure better wages, welfare and work prospects for all workers.In the pandemic, our local businesses and workers were heavily impacted. NTUC worked closely with the Government to coordinate assistance programmes to protect lives and livelihoods. Our support ranged from unions\\' ground efforts with companies to \"cut costs to save jobs\", to the provision of cash relief to union members and helping tens of thousands of workers with skills retraining and job placements.All these policies and programmes are not possible without the trust and value that tripartism had achieved over the years. As Prime Minister Mr Lee Hsien Loong had said in his speech at the May Day Rally 2018, \"Tripartism has seen us through every crisis since Independence... Through our first major recessions, the oil crisis in 1970s, the major recession in 1985… It showed us through the Asian Financial Crisis, SARS and the Global Financial Crisis. Each time, the challenges seemed daunting, sometimes even overwhelming. But without the Labour Movement partnering companies, without the NTUC partnering the PAP in a symbiotic relationship, without the Government, unions and businesses sharing responsibility for Singapore\\'s future, we would not have made it here.\" Tripartite trust built up over decades withstood many trials and tribulations in our young history and was strengthened after each and every crisis. COVID-19 was no exception and we must continue to strengthen this trust that is the basis of tripartism going to the future.  Moving forward, the Labour Movement will persist in our efforts to protect the rights and to advance the interests and aspirations of all workers. The future of work will have new sets of challenges and difficulties: ever-evolving geopolitics, technological advancements and disruptions and sociocultural shifts. NTUC will continue to renew and strengthen our compact with our workers. To do so, NTUC launched the #EveryWorkerMatters Conversations (#EWMC) last year to refresh our compact with our workers and to give greater assurance that we will journey with them, alongside them and to champion their cause. Through the #EWMC, we have heard the voices of various groups of workers across all ages, sectors and backgrounds, and we will adjust our strategies to meet their needs and their aspirations. I will now share three main areas that NTUC will focus on going forward: (a) expand career opportunities; (b) enhance assurance and protection; and (c) ensure career resilience.Let me start with the first area – expand career opportunities – with a quote from the President last week, “Every Singaporean must have the opportunity to take on work they find meaningful and fulfilling, build on their talents, give of their best and be rewarded fairly for it.” At NTUC, we want to provide each and every worker with an equal chance to choose a career that they want and to advance as far as they wish in a way to allow them to grow and to develop. Let me highlight two worker segments and what are our plans for them.First is the skilled tradesmen. In early February 2023, the NTUC Secretary-General mooted the Career Progression Model (CPM) as part of our efforts to uplift workers in skilled essential trades, to develop their skills, help them attain mastery and build long-term potential careers. The CPM was a continuation of what the NTUC Secretary-General said previously in 2020, and again in 2021, about professionalising the solar technologists and plumbers respectively through a Career Development Plan. COVID-19 border restrictions revealed an urgent need to step up our efforts to uplift this sector. There are currently more than 50,000 local workers in skilled trades, ranging from electrical and electronic tradesmen, building and related trades workers, among others. However, there is also a growing concern of a “skilled trades gap” as the older generation retires, coupled with the lack of qualified candidates to step up to fill the gaps. According to the Singapore Labour Force Survey 2022, more than half of the craftsmen and related trades workers are currently above 50 years old. NTUC wants to ensure a sustainable supply of locals into these trades to meet our national needs. To start off, NTUC will prioritise three essential trades that have a direct impact on our daily lives – plumbers, electricians and air-conditioner technicians. Supporting these workers is also part of our social compact to be a more inclusive society, where we do not just recognise cognitive skills but also technical and hands-on skills.Another key group that we set out to engage is youths. Youths today are faced with a more competitive education and employment landscape. At the height of COVID-19 when there were limited jobs, the SGUnited Traineeships Programme has been a tremendous help. But NTUC thinks that our younger workers, embarking on the first steps in their careers, will need more support. We want our future workforce to be able to dream big, aspire high and achieve their fullest potential in whatever they wish to do in a wide range of career opportunities. Mr Raj Joshua Thomas will be happy to hear that we will be partnering many Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) to allow a lot more opportunities for our young undergraduates in this area of work.NTUC’s networks with industry and with workers of different cohorts make us well placed to link them up with internship opportunities and career mentors across different sectors. We will share more on our plans over the next few months.  The second area of focus is to enhance career assurance and protection. We want to support our workers with their immediate concerns in tackling higher cost of living and also in addressing mid- to longer-term issues of job security, unemployment support, retirement adequacy and also caregiver support. For our lower-wage workers, the Labour Movement has been actively pushing for more workers to be covered under the PWM. We have made much progress in uplifting lower-wage workers and will continue to press on to cover all sectors and to implement PWM in good time.  Our mid-career workers, especially those above 40 years of age, are another segment of workers who are very vulnerable to industry disruptions and restructuring. They are also in a particularly precarious position should they lose their jobs, as they generally have more dependents and more financial responsibilities. We will continue to advocate income support for those who lose their jobs, tied to certain active job seeking and reskilling. My fellow Labour Member of Parliament Mr Patrick Tay has been championing for unemployment support and protection in Parliament since as early as 2014 and on several other occasions in the House, and I am sure he will continue to push for it through the PME Taskforce proposal that was finalised in 2021.  NTUC also recognises that more protections should be accorded to our freelance and self-employed workers, including our platform workers. The recent announcement on work injuries compensation, improving housing and retirement adequacy, and enhancing representation is a welcomed move. We will continue to work closely with the tripartite partners to see through the implementation and to further strengthen their representation. Our senior workers should also be tapped upon and valued for their experience and their industry knowledge. Our workers must also be assured that they are able to achieve basic retirement adequacy. Finally, workers with caregiving responsibilities often find it challenging to balance their career aspirations, finances and caring for their loved ones. We want to look into how we can better support them to reduce the mental and emotional load on caregivers. The third area of focus for NTUC is to ensure career resilience. As the global job market evolves, our workers will experience change and disruption over their lifetime in their career. And this increases the importance of career resilience and upskilling. To plan for a longer horizon, NTUC will support our workers to handle career changes by developing new and deepening existing skills to stay relevant and competitive. During the Budget debate, I have called for training allowances to be given to mid-career workers to give them greater peace of mind in undergoing longer and also undergoing the SkillsFuture Career Transition Programme. I have also called for increased financial support and protected training time to enable workers to acquire deeper skillsets throughout their careers, or equip themselves to pivot to new areas. Going forward, this is an area that will need support from all tripartite partners to ensure our workers’ skillsets remain relevant and our businesses have adequate workers to sustain our future economy.Finally, I will continue to call on all employers to work with NTUC to form the Company Training Committees (CTCs). With the acceleration of digital and green economy, it is imperative for companies to plan ahead, to capitalise key trends and transform their businesses. Through CTCs, NTUC will support companies to do all that, plus redesign jobs, upskill and reskill workers and collectively achieve greater business and workers’ outcomes. CTCs are a win-win initiative for employers and workers, supported firmly by the Government through the CTC grant. Mr Speaker, Sir, in Mandarin, please. (In Mandarin): [Please refer to Vernacular Speech.] Mr Speaker, in order to better understand the aspirations of our workers and better serve them, NTUC has rolled out the #EveryWorkerMatters Conversations that lasted for one year, starting from August last year. Through more active communication with our workers, we want to work together with them to create a better future.  NTUC will focus on three key areas in our future work: first, help workers to capture economic opportunities in the future; second, protect our workers\\' interest; and third, increase the career resilience of our workers. First, NTUC will help workers capture opportunities in the future. We hope that through the Career Progression Model, we can encourage more Singaporeans to enter craftsman and related trades such as plumbing, electrical works and air-conditioning maintenance and master a skill. This will also ensure the continuous development of these industries. We also need to ensure that our youth and young workers, no matter what economic situation our country is in, will be able to find suitable jobs, use their skills and contribute to our economy. Second, NTUC will continue to protect our workers’ interests. In the short term, NTUC will help our workers address higher cost of living; in the medium to longterm, NTUC will help address urgent issues including providing better jobs, unemployment insurance, retirement adequacy and care support. As the global economy and technology continues to advance, workers between the ages of 40 and 50 will continue to face higher risk of being unemployed or replaced. The Government, during the pandemic, has rolled out many programmes to help our workers retain their jobs. In the future, NTUC will work together with the Government to expand our programme to help more Singaporeans.In addition, with the number of platform workers rising and the development of the gig economy, NTUC will work together with our tripartite partners, through the Advisory Committee on Platform Workers, to enhance the retirement adequacy, housing security and work injury insurance for our platform workers. These will better represent the interests of our freelancers and self-employed workers. Third, improving our workers\\' career resilience. We must encourage our workers to continue to upskill and strengthen their competitiveness and adaptability in the new environment. During the Budget debate, I have asked for more training allowances and training time so that workers can receive long-term and deeper training with peace of mind.In addition, since 2019, NTUC has encouraged enterprises to set up their Company Training Committee (CTC) to help the company to transform and upgrade and allow their employees to participate in training to upskill and transform. We hope that with more enterprises joining this programme, more workers would be able to master future-ready skills and companies can enjoy stronger competitiveness too. In conclusion, our goals are very simple. We want to help our workers to find a job that they are proud of, protect their livelihood and create a brighter future with quality jobs and lives.(In English): Mr Speaker, Sir, in Singapore, generations of Government and NTUC leaders have worked hard to uphold personal integrity and trust in every aspect. And the dividends can clearly be seen in the way we have navigated through the pandemic. However, we must be vigilant to always nurture this trust because we are not immune to what is happening around us and around the world.  As the Labour Movement, we will continue to advocate workers’ interests through improving wages, welfare and work prospects. As shared by Mr Lee Kuan Yew at a mass rally in Geylang Serai in 1959 and, thereafter, repeated at the NTUC’s 50th Anniversary Dinner in 2011, and I quote, “In Government, I have never forgotten that it is in the interests of workers and their unions that we must strive for growth and development. In other words, growth is meaningless unless it is shared by the workers, shared not only directly in wage increases but indirectly in better homes, better schools, better hospitals, better playing fields and, generally, a healthier environment for families to bring up their children.” The President Address last week sets out the Government’s plans to achieve just that.In the Labour Movement, our commitment is to always put workers first, ensure that workers will have better job opportunities, assurances and protection and the resilience to adapt, upskill and retrain themselves to remain relevant for the future. Mr Speaker, I support the Motion. [Applause.]Mr Speaker: Order. I propose to take a break now. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at 3.50 pm. Sitting accordingly suspended at 3.32 pm until 3.50 pm.Sitting resumed at 3.50 pm.[Mr Speaker in the Chair] DEBATE ON PRESIDENT\\'S ADDRESSDebate resumed.Mr Speaker: Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim.',\n",
       " 'Mr Speaker, Sir, in my maiden speech three years ago in a similar Address of Thanks, I talked about the building blocks of our nation and society. I likened it to the Lego bricks that my son loves to play with.First, at the core of its structure, each brick must be strong. This is the family unit and each of us, fellow Singaporeans.Second, the interlocking connection between each brick must be strong. This is our social cohesion that makes building something bigger than ourselves not just possible but also durable in the long run.Third, the different shapes and sizes of each Lego brick not only complement one another but also when combined makes them unique and vibrant. This is our multiracial and multi-religious society that makes Singapore rich not only in culture but also diverse in views and expertise.This is why I resonate with the Address of the President, which reiterates the Government\\'s commitment to strengthen our basic building blocks – our families and fellow Singaporeans – by holding on to our core values of fairness, inclusivity, mutual support and giving back to society. These values were embodied in the many success stories of our everyday Singaporeans working together with the Government, the community and the businesses to help all of us get through the pandemic together.For me, President Halimah\\'s speech not only presented the Government\\'s priorities and plans in the coming period, but it also acknowledged how we managed to overcome the pandemic and its challenges together as one society. The President\\'s speech also reminded us that we face an important challenge to ensure that there remains continued trust between the political leadership and our people and between all of us fellow Singaporeans.This is not to say that we have to be monolithic or homogenous in our views and approach. We need courageous Singaporeans who are brave enough to experiment things differently, who dare to speak up and are willing to stand up for the issues that matter to all Singaporeans. Inevitably, this part of the nation-building process means that there will necessarily be divergent views – each with its own benefits and trade-offs. The rigour of debates and contestation of ideas on issues that are important to Singaporeans can help all of us formulate new ways forward for Singapore. Iron sharpens iron.However, at the same time, such discussions must be done respectfully and responsibly, based on facts and on honest terms. Whether these discussions are in the halls of this House or in the comfort of our homes, we can hold different opinions but we must believe in the same vision for the betterment of Singapore.This must be our pillar of strength – our unity in diversity regardless of race, religion or political inclinations.Through the Forward Singapore conversations, the Government\\'s call to involve various stakeholders – employers, workers, community partners, civil society and, indeed, all Singaporeans – in our nation-building means that we would be able to tap on our nation\\'s greatest resource; not our Reserves but each other\\'s strengths and expertise.We must unlock our collective spirit to help one another. This is the principle of social solidarity where the people, through its government, bear equally the responsibility and burden for helping fellow citizens. The task of helping the underprivileged or vulnerable in our society does not fall on the shoulders of the Government or civil society alone but on all of us.But how do we maintain such social cohesion and solidarity? Just like the Lego bricks, we need to strengthen the interlocking connections that bind us and guard against threats and external forces that seek to divide us and undermining our painstakingly built level of trust in the institutions of our nation and society. During the first half of this Parliament term, this House has debated and passed various pieces of legislation to further put us in better stead to withstand against such potential external forces through amendments to the Online Safety Act, enactment of the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act and the formation of the Digital and Intelligence Service of the SAF.Externally, we must continue to remain vigilant and ensure our laws keep up to date with global trends, threats and developments. Internally, we must remain steadfast and committed to our Singaporean values of living in an open but multiracial and multi-religious society. The pandemic has laid bare the vulnerabilities of societies all over the world. Global studies have found that there is a correlation between the pandemic and explicit xenophobic and racial prejudices.Anti-discrimination or legislative guards against hate speech go some way but we also need a softer approach for a more enduring harmony. I look forward to the Government\\'s plans to ensure that our laws remain relevant in maintaining our social and racial harmony.In particular, I am looking forward to the full implementation of the Maintenance of Racial Harmony Act, first announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong during the 2021 National Day Rally speech. This will complement the existing Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act passed since 1990.The new law is meant to consolidate all current legal powers dispersed across the Penal Code and Sedition Act to ensure the maintenance of racial harmony in Singapore. It will not only provide the powers to restrain someone from committing an offence regarding racism but also compel them to learn more about the other race. This understanding and appreciation of one another\\'s values and cultures is the key towards breaking the cycle of ignorance and racism.I hope that the law will also offer protection to whistle-blowers who report such instances of racial prejudices and unfair employment practices.Besides protection and safeguards on our social cohesion, we also need ways to promote social solidarity. I agree with the President that as we strive for success and progress for our nation, we must not allow our society to stratify into those who have and those who are left behind. We need to build a sense of collective responsibility among us.We must appreciate the interdependence between people in our society. We must make Singaporeans feel that they can improve the lives of others and, in the same process, uplift their own lives in a meaningful way. This begins with our young. As such, I welcome the changes to our education system to promote greater social mixing and competency-based subject learning and the infusion of value-based interactions and engagements in our children\\'s educational journey.In adulthood and working life, we see more businesses – both employers and employees – dedicate more pro bono hours towards corporate social responsibility activities on various causes that are beneficial to Singaporeans. We must continue to promote and incentivise this \"paying it forward\" as part of our working culture here in Singapore and truly understand that there is no contradiction between doing what is best for the company and doing what is good for the community and nation. The President also emphasised that in paying it forward, we must help one another to stand tall with dignity and pride. This means that it is not patronising from the perspective of the person receiving.In this regard, I am glad that we have provided various uplifting measures that allow those who need a helping hand to get the boost they need to upgrade and upskill themselves in the path towards social mobility. This is a work in progress and we must continue to refine the approach and solutions in a targeted yet dignified and respectful manner without converting the social mobility ladder into a crutch of help that will be both belittling and debilitating.The last term of our Parliament session has also seen the Government afford more help through housing, healthcare and social welfare policies, passing legislation to form the Public Defender\\'s Office to allow greater access to criminal justice and changes to the Misuse of Drugs Act, which affords greater vigilance against the scourge of drug abuse, especially on the vulnerable segments of our society.We must continue to keep a close eye on areas that will affect the social harmony and justice for the vulnerable groups in our society. Sir, in Malay, please.(In Malay): [Please refer to Vernacular Speech.] In my view, President Halimah\\'s speech not only lays out the Government\\'s priorities and future plans, but it also acknowledges how we managed to overcome the pandemic together as one people. At the same time, however, the President\\'s speech recognised that the key challenge is to ensure that there was continued trust between the political leadership and our people and between Singaporeans.   Our pillars of strength are peace and unity in diversity regardless of race, religion or political views. I agree that the approach and discussion of issues that concern our people and community should be discussed respectfully, responsibly, factually and judiciously. I agree that generally, for issues that are important to our country, many of us place national interests above individual rights. However, this is not always guaranteed and the critical challenge for all of us is to prioritise social cohesion and our country’s progress in an ever-changing post-pandemic world.     Let us respond to the call for unity to ensure that while we achieve progress for our people and country, we do not overlook those who are in greater need so that they are not engulfed in the tide of modernity and change. We should not leave them behind because if everyone does not experience happiness and progress, our social fabric will be incomplete and imperfect – as the Malay proverb goes, it will be like an unfinished dress because the thread ran out and the needle broke.(In English): Mr Speaker, Sir, as our society grows through decades of nation-building, we have built a sense of identity and belonging as Singaporeans. However, who qualifies as a member of our society should not be narrowly defined and we should not be quick to succumb to the othering phenomenon and the pitting of \"us\" versus \"them\" – whatever \"us\" and \"them\" mean. The fault lines in our society can be easily exploited, knowingly or unknowingly, through the differences in how we look, where we come from, whether or not we can speak a certain language, whether we belong to the same social standing or whether we agree or disagree on a particular policy. We cannot allow these to seep into the language of our politics and divide us.I concur with the President\\'s call for all of us to close ranks and stand united regardless of race, religion or political affiliation, especially when it comes to core national interests.SG50, SG Together, SGUnited, SG Cares – all of these campaigns are reminders of what we can achieve when we remain united in our hearts and minds. Let us continue to stand with one another. I stand in support of the Motion.Mr Speaker: Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.',\n",
       " 'Mr Speaker, as the President highlighted in her speech, this new session of Parliament is happening at an important milestone of our history, indeed, of world history. After three years of the COVID-19 crisis, we now confront other formidable challenges. But as we have seen again and again in our history, we can find opportunities in every crisis and move quickly to take advantage of them.There are stark realities facing Singapore and the wider world. From the war in Europe to deepening big power rivalry in our part of the world, we all feel a palpable sense of danger – danger not just to the economy, but also to an open and stable global order.  We will continue to be afflicted by these external headwinds. I know many Singaporeans worry about the unexpected twists and turns that may lie ahead. They see interest rates, prices and bills going up and impacting their livelihoods. That is why I had implemented comprehensive support measures in this year\\'s Budget. These measures will help to cover the inflation-induced increase in spending for lower- and middle-income households. Some of the support has been given out, while others will be rolled out progressively over the year. We have and will continue to do everything we can to address the stresses and strains that people feel on the ground.  Besides tackling the cost of living, sustaining growth will be more challenging in this new environment. We will have to redouble our efforts to attract investments and talent, and create good jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans. We will have to intensify the pace of restructuring and transformation to stay ahead of the competition.  All this will not be easy, but COVID-19 has shown that Singaporeans have what it takes – the grit and resolve to overcome tough challenges. The odds may appear stacked against us, but we can turn challenges into opportunity. With pride in our history and strength from our unity, we can forge ahead with confidence. So, I say – do not fear. Never lose heart.We will build on our strong foundations, but we must also have the courage to change where change is needed. This is what my colleagues and I have set out to do with Forward Singapore. Through this exercise, we are reviewing our policies across all areas. We will ensure that the broad middle of society and their children see continued improvements in their lives, and that we close the gaps for the more disadvantaged groups. We have heard from Singaporeans over the past months – your views, aspirations and ideas. The many conversations and partnerships have yielded fresh insights on what we can do differently in our next stage of nation-building. Today, I will share some of the key shifts that we will embark on as part of our new social compact: a new approach on skills; a new definition of success; a new approach for social support; a new approach to caring for our seniors; and a renewed commitment to one another – less about \"I\" and \"me\", more about \"us\" and \"we\".If we succeed in effecting these shifts, we can secure a stronger social compact and not just among ourselves, but between this generation and future generations to come.Let me start with our new approach on skills, for skills are the lynchpin to lifelong success. The skills journey begins early in life. We want every child to have a strong foundation that can propel them forward through life. We know that the first few years matter greatly in shaping a child\\'s potential. So, we are scaling up the KidSTART programme nationwide to reach out to more lower-income parents and to close the early gaps in our children\\'s lives.Beyond the age of three, we are stepping up the provision of MOE Kindergartens and Government-funded preschools. Enrolment in preschool at ages five to six is already near universal, but the attendance rate of children from lower-income families can still be improved. At ages three to four especially, more children from such families can also benefit from enrolling in preschool. We will study how to strengthen their participation in these early years of development, so that we can give the children in these families the best possible start in life.Once our children enter the school system, there is a comprehensive system in place to help them develop and grow. We already provide more resources in our schools to support children with greater learning needs. And we will continue to do more on this front, so that every child can realise his or her full potential.But there is a deeper challenge in our education system: our concept of meritocracy remains too narrow. Many feel caught in a rat race from a young age – under pressure to get the best grades, get into what they perceive to be the best schools so that they can get the best university places.Many parents, too, are anxious about their children\\'s future. Some go to great lengths to maximise their children\\'s chances to get into perceived brand name schools, even preschools. A decade ago, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said that \"Every school is a good school”. I fully agree with this. Because in Singapore, everyone can be assured that, no matter which schools their children are admitted into, they will receive a good education, and they will be well supported by their teachers. That was my lived experience too. I went to the primary and secondary schools near my home and reaped the full benefits of learning in those schools.That was decades ago. And the quality of our schools and teachers has improved dramatically since. These days, our teachers do not just focus on content and knowledge. They help our children to think independently and instil in them qualities and values that contribute to lasting success in life.Remember, at the end of the day, we are more than our grades. We are more than the schools we go to.This is an aspiration Singaporeans have voiced for some time now, from when we held Our Singapore Conversation a decade ago. Since then, we have made significant moves and slayed some sacred cows.Today, PSLE T-scores are a thing of the past. So will be the labels of Normal (Technical), Normal (Academic) and Express streams. In their place, there is full Subject-based Banding (SBB). We hope these moves will go some way to remove the stressors in our education system. But more importantly, we hope they will signal to all in society that we are serious about refreshing our system.I hope that our society too – every man, woman and child, young and old, rich or poor – all of us will be serious about refreshing our mindsets about schools and grades. It is not possible to change something that has become so ingrained in our nature by government decree. We must be the change we want to see in our society. Every Singaporean must want to give themselves and their children more breathing space to discover and develop their diverse talents and to maximise their potential.How do we achieve this?A key mindset shift is to recognise that formal education early in life is not the endpoint of our meritocracy. Far from it. Our refreshed meritocracy must be a continuous one, with learning opportunities, milestones and ladders at multiple junctures. All must have the chance to try again, do better and move forward in life, years after leaving school. So, the skills journey begins in schools but it does not end with schools. Our new approach on skills must include a fresh commitment to making continuous learning, reskilling and upskilling a way of life.In fact, this will become more important with slower economic growth, rapid technological disruptions and greater job churn. To remain an upwardly mobile society, lifelong learning will be key – not just upskilling once and being done with it, but multiple times, to become more adaptable and resilient, well-equipped and confident to face the future.To get there, education cannot be confined to the first 25 years of our lives. Learning must be a lifelong journey for the whole of our lives.We launched SkillsFuture in 2015. We have made some headway since then, but there is still much more to be done. We are therefore looking at major changes to strengthen SkillsFuture.We aim to reduce the costs and lower the barriers to training. We will work with industry partners to come up with effective training programmes, including work-based learning options. These courses will have to be better curated and vetted so that they translate into meaningful employment outcomes. We will discuss with tripartite partners how we can support workers to take time off to train. This will help the workers individually, but it will help businesses too. At the same time, businesses must shift their emphasis from hiring credentials to hiring skills and invest in the development of their employees. And Singaporeans themselves must be open to change.Sir, let me share with you the story of Afifah. Nur Afifah Bte Rakif graduated with a Diploma in Communication and Information Design 11 years ago, when she was 22. She later chose to teach in a preschool in 2013, took up various early childhood education programmes to reskill and upskill, and became the Deputy Centre Lead of the NTUC First Campus. To strengthen her skillsets, she is now pursuing a degree under the Singapore University of Social Science (SUSS) Work-Study Programme and will graduate later this year. Afifah exemplifies the spirit of lifelong learning and the value of reskilling and upskilling in pursuing one\\'s passions. And I salute her.With this new approach on skills, how well you did in school should not define the opportunities you can unlock nor should it determine your entire life. You are not stuck at your highest formal educational level attained; you can update your skillsets, pivot to new careers, seize new opportunities and keep moving forward in life.Some other nations aspire to create a welfare society from cradle to grave. We will aspire to create in Singapore a full-fledged learning society – from cradle to grave. [Applause.]That is how we will become a people ready for the future and equipped to succeed.But what does success mean? Naturally, it means different things to different people, in different places. Yet somehow, as a society, we tend to converge around a few material definitions – the size of the paycheck or the property we own.How can we shift our lens and collectively adopt and embrace wider definitions of success? After all, success is really for each one of us to define. There is no model answer to follow. We should not feel pressured to compare with others or to conform to preconceived notions. The Japanese talk about discovering your \"ikigai\" – something that gives you a sense of purpose and joy. We should strive to be a meritocracy where everyone can be the best possible version of themselves and where there are many ways for diverse talents to contribute and earn respect in our society.Mindset shifts are necessary, but I do not think mindset shifts alone will effect societal change. It is not enough to say we will celebrate a variety of professions. Our economic structures, remuneration and career prospects in various professions must also be consistent with what we value.So, we will consider ways to tilt the scales and narrow the wage gap across professions. One specific way is to further professionalise skilled trades, like electricians and plumbers. Why not enable them to attain accreditation for their skills and set a clearer progression ladder as they take on greater responsibilities? We can ascribe the right values to such forms of labour and grant such workers greater remuneration as professionals.More broadly, we also want to give Singaporeans who graduate from ITE and polytechnics stronger assurance; that their wages and career prospects will not be too far below their university-going peers and will not be permanently conscribed to be below. So, they do not have to succumb to a paper chase to secure a good salary and a viable career path. They can excel in the professions that they have trained in and have the aptitude for, be it hospitality, infocomm, social services or others. There are many ways to make a difference, many talents to nurture and many forms of contributions to reward.Take lower-wage workers for example. Many of them serve in essential services, like security, lift maintenance and cleaning. We have been doing much to uplift lower-wage workers through Workfare and the PWM, and we will continue to do so: increase wages, set out a skills ladder, and provide opportunities to upgrade. We cannot close the gap altogether between lower-wage and median workers, but we can certainly stop their wages from diverging too far.Here, I have a plea to everyone: for a new definition of success to become a reality, all of us – as consumers – must be willing to bear a higher cost for the goods and services we consume. We must recognise the important work that our fellow citizens undertake to keep our society going and do our part to uplift them and boost their wage prospects.I know this is not an easy ask, given the rising cost of living. But we will do our best to manage the pace of change and to help everyone, especially our lower- and middle-income families, adjust to this new environment. And I might add too – all will gain when even the most vulnerable among us become better off. We will become a better people, a more just and a more equal society.In a more uncertain world, we must also relook our approach on social support. How can we assure both the broad middle and the vulnerable that they can meet their needs in life and not fall by the wayside or be left behind?For the vulnerable, we have been gradually shifting our approach from social assistance to social empowerment. We want not only to help people tide through difficulty, but also to boost their sense of drive and purpose, and strengthen their sense of agency and ownership over their own circumstances.For example, today, we have the Fresh Start Housing Scheme to help second-timer lower-income families, like Mr Gan and his wife Mdm Chai, own a home. The two of them work as cleaners and they lived in a rental flat in Redhill. But they were determined to buy a home of their own for themselves and their young daughter.Mr Gan and Mdm Chai joined the Fresh Start Housing Scheme and received personalised support and financial guidance from HDB and social service officers (SSOs) throughout their home ownership journey. They received a $35,000 Fresh Start Housing Grant and the rest of the loan will be fully serviced by their CPF contributions.Today, the Gans are proud owners of a 2-room flexi flat in Bukit Batok. They collected their keys two months ago and just moved in earlier this month. Their daughter is very excited about getting to decorate her own space. And over the next five years, our officers will continue to walk alongside them and give them the support they need.The Fresh Start Housing Scheme is, in effect, a means to uplift and empower the vulnerable. We want to expand this approach of empowerment to cover more forms of social assistance. For instance, we could provide additional financial help to vulnerable families who do their part to help themselves, such as staying gainfully employed and sending their children to preschool regularly. So, the more a family takes ownership of their goals, the more we will help you to reach even higher – a mutually reinforcing, virtuous circle.We also want to consider another group: persons with disabilities (PwDs). We will do more to alleviate the impediments they face in life and adopt new ways of caring for and empowering them. In particular, we want to reduce the financial burden on parents of children attending special education (SPED) schools and care centres.Equally important is to empower persons with disabilitiesPwDs when they reach adulthood. We will involve and enable them to contribute to society. The onus is on all of us to find ways to affirm the dignity of our differently-abled citizens and enable them to realise their full potential.Sir, all of us must come together to fight the ills of inequality. Singapore must never succumb to the kind of harsh inequality we see in so many other parts of the world. However treacherous the terrains ahead, so long as Singapore continues to progress, all Singaporeans must continue to progress, with none among us left behind.No less important in our social strategy is to assure the broad middle that they, too, can be confident of meeting their needs at every stage of life, even in the face of setbacks. Housing, education and healthcare – these are basic needs for all Singaporeans. This Government has delivered on all these fronts over the decades and we will continue to do so.We know that housing is top-of-mind – we have discussed this recently in Parliament, in the housing debate, and in the Budget. We are sparing no effort to ramp up the supply of Build-To-Order (BTO) flats and to catch up on the delays caused by COVID-19. We have tightened the rules, so that flats go to those who need them most, as quickly as possible. And we are doing more to help younger married couples and parents own their first home. We will get this work done and we will deliver the results. Affordable and accessible public housing will always be a key pillar of our social compact under the PAP Government.Our approach to social support also extends to how we will support our people in the face of setbacks. In a more volatile jobs landscape, we can expect more among us to be displaced from time to time. Today, we help the unemployed through schemes like ComCare and the COVID-19 Recovery Grant. They provide timely assistance while upholding our ethos of work and self-reliance.But we also know that losing a job is a major setback, which can easily destabilise workers and their families. So, the Government will consider doing more to support our displaced workers. We know that automatic unemployment benefits can, and have, often led to negative outcomes elsewhere, because displaced workers who receive generous benefits may find it more attractive to stay unemployed, rather than to get back into the workforce.So, we want to design a support scheme that provides assurance but avoids these negative outcomes: a targeted re-employment scheme that will reduce the strain on displaced workers to make ends meet, while still encouraging them to continue with their upskilling and job search.We intend to make this shift in our social strategy, so every Singaporean can be confident. In this harsh, unpredictable world, we will have your back and we will support you. We will cheer you on, so you can strive to achieve, do your best and bounce back stronger. [Applause.]Strengthening our assurances extends to caring for our seniors too – this is an urgent need, given our rapidly ageing demographics. By the end of this decade, one in four Singaporeans will be above 65, as Members are well aware. We must adopt a new approach to care for our seniors well and in a sustainable way.We embarked on Healthier SG recently to care for our seniors upstream. Healthier SG signals a shift from treating illnesses to promoting health. If we can help our seniors stay healthy, we will reduce the need for medical intervention and hospitalisation downstream.But care for seniors goes beyond physical health. As our seniors age, we want them to be cared for in their own homes for as long as possible, rather than in a nursing home. This way, they can remain active and purposeful in their golden years, surrounded by family, friends and familial activities. It will not be possible for everyone, but I believe we can make it possible for most.And we will invest in our infrastructure to make this happen: build more Community Care Apartments; expand the network of Active Ageing Centres; improve access to home-based care services; and work with community partners to prevent loneliness and social isolation. We will do all this and more, so we can create a home truly for our seniors.Our seniors must also be confident of meeting their retirement needs. We achieve this through our CPF system, which we will continue to evolve and update. The Government, in fact, now plays a larger role in CPF through higher interest for those with lower CPF balances, the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme, as well as supplementing CPF payouts with Silver Support. We will study enhancing these schemes to better support our seniors, including those nearing retirement who have less runway to work and save.For younger Singaporeans, as long as you work and contribute to your CPF consistently, we will ensure that your needs in old age can be met through CPF. And for those who do not have the ability to work, we will find other ways to look after your retirement needs. This is our promise to Singaporeans of every generation.Let me move on to something that underlies our refreshed social compact: we need to be less about \"I\", \"me\" and \"mine\", more about \"we\", \"us\" and \"ours\". It was our sense of collective responsibility that saw us through the pandemic, and it is the same sense of collective responsibility that will carry us through our next bound.A social compact is not just about what Government will do for the people; it is also about what Singaporeans will do for one another. So, our refreshed social compact is not just about the Government doing more and Singaporeans depending more on the Government. Rather, it is about the Government, businesses, unions, workers, the community and civil society all doing their part for fellow Singaporeans. It is about all of us coming together, to forge a society of opportunities and assurance for everyone.One way to realise this is to nurture a broader culture of philanthropy and volunteerism: where we take responsibility for each other and especially to help those with less. This goes beyond money, it includes investing time and effort in nurturing others – from mentoring the young to providing those from disadvantaged circumstances with access to networks and opportunities. Another way is to create more opportunities for Singaporeans to partner the Government and one another in policy-making and co-creation. We will continue to involve Singaporeans and other groups in co-designing and shaping our neighbourhoods. We will provide more avenues and platforms for our youth to come up with policy ideas and build the future Singapore, for they are Singapore\\'s future. The Government will never stop investing in our urban infrastructure, developing our HDB towns by providing more facilities and amenities, and making concerted efforts to become a City in Nature. But ultimately, it is up to all of us to contribute their own passions and energies to turn this city into an endearing home. Becoming the best home is also very much about the intangibles – among them, embracing a more holistic way of life. Be it working out flexible work arrangements; treating ourselves and one another with greater kindness and compassion, knowing that good mental health is a key part of good health overall, or creating a conducive environment for Singaporeans to start and nurture families. We made some moves in the Budget this year, such as increasing paternity leave and we will consider what more can be done.  This project of making a better Singapore has always been, and will always be, a work in progress. It has been a relentless effort over the decades. We will never stop improving, not just for ourselves but also for future generations. This ethos of building for the future, rather than burdening or weighing down our descendants, is key to Singapore\\'s success. The prudence of the previous generation has enabled us to find our way through the COVID-19 crisis. We must do the same for those who come after us. So, let us steward our resources well, so that our children and grandchildren will be well-endowed and well-prepared to tackle any challenge the future may bring – be it the climate crisis, the next pandemic, or the unknown unknowns which will come. Sir, I have provided a broad overview of what we hope to achieve through Forward Singapore. Over the next few days of the debate, my colleagues will elaborate further on specific aspects of the agenda. Taken together, what do these shifts to our social compact mean? In fact, some ask, has the 4G team shifted to the left?  It is not so simple. Our governing approach is not so easy to characterise along the traditional political spectrum of left and right. After all, we have always strived to appeal to a broad base of Singaporeans. We have always taken care not to base our legitimacy on any narrow social group or class.  We also do not blindly copy or replicate the models of other countries. Even the first generation of PAP leaders, who began their political lives as democratic socialists, spoke of a \"Socialism that Works\" – for they did not want any part of what they already knew was failing in Europe and elsewhere.  The countries with more welfarist policies, in continental Europe and the Nordics have much higher levels of state-financed welfare provisions. Their governments typically spend above 40% of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP), compared to 18% in Singapore. To fund such high spending, they impose high income taxes, usually much higher than 30%, even for the middle-income groups, with Value-added Tax (VAT) or Goods and Services Tax (GST) taxes ranging from 20% to 25%.Some may think this is a good model for Singapore, but from our point of view, from the Government\\'s point of view, it is very clear: we do not intend to adopt such a model of comprehensive universal welfare. Instead, we will chart our own way forward, staying true to our core values. While we will indeed do more to strengthen social safety nets, we will move with prudence and discipline, and not end up inflicting heavy tax burdens on everyone. Today, our overall tax burden for the middle-income group is far lower than other advanced nations and we will strive to keep it that way.  More than that, we will ensure that our programmes achieve better outcomes for our people. In fact, we are already doing better than many other countries in areas like healthcare, education and housing; doing better not in terms of how much we spend, but in terms of outcomes – the value that we achieve from every dollar of public spending. We are doing better and we can keep on doing better. That is the spirit and intent behind the shifts we are considering – be it skills and continuous learning, social empowerment, active ageing and retirement adequacy, or housing assurances. The changes will benefit Singaporeans from every walk of life – they will uplift the vulnerable and also advance the well-being of our broad middle.In fact, among the more advanced nations, Singapore is one of the few where people in the middle have experienced large increases of incomes in the last 20 years. The middle-income group in Singapore now has higher real incomes – real incomes after netting off inflations – than in many other places; higher than the US and most European societies and well above that in other advanced Asian societies, like Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea. We will continue to sustain real income growth for the middle. This is why economic growth is non-negotiable for us. We already know that our growth rates will gradually come down as our labour force expands more slowly and becomes older, but growth remains essential. If we do not grow the economic pie, there will be fewer jobs and less scope for social support. So, please do not be mistaken. This Government will and must always be pro-growth and pro-inclusivity. Securing our economic competitiveness will become more, not less, important in the next phase of Singapore. This is incumbent upon all of us, and upon my team: we will create good jobs and a good future for all Singaporeans. Underlining our governing approach is the core ethic of individual effort and personal and family responsibility. We want Government actions to reinforce, not negate, individual and collective responsibility. We want Government actions to catalyse more involvement by other members of society – employers, unions, community groups and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Then we can all chip in and do our part collectively, to tackle inequality, rekindle social mobility and move forward together.  Sir, I believe the Opposition, and the Workers\\' Party (WP) in particular, broadly agrees with and supports the Government\\'s policy directions. They want us to do more in certain areas, as we have heard from the speeches today and I am sure in the coming days, but there is general support for the moves that we have proposed.  But there is one fundamental difference. When we plan to spend more, the PAP Government will always tell you plainly how we propose to raise revenues and ensure that our Budget remains balanced over the medium-term. The Opposition has offered some revenue alternatives, but their sums do not add up. We do not need to go through the detailed arguments again. But without the GST, which the WP still does not support – and I am not even talking about the increase in GST, but the entire GST which the WP still does not support – we will face a huge funding gap. None of the alternatives that the WP has suggested will make up for the shortfall. In this debate and over the course of the remaining term of Government, I look forward to hearing concrete alternatives from the Opposition – not just opportunistic or populist ideas to chip away, bit by bit, at the trust in Government, but a serious alternative agenda for an alternative government.  That is how politics in a first-world Parliament should work. I have said this before: I do not assume that the PAP will win the next General Election or that I will inevitably take over as Prime Minister. Every General Election from now on will be about who forms the Government; not just what percentage of the votes the PAP receives and how many seats the Opposition wins. As we develop into a mature democracy, we must have not just a serious Government, but also a serious Opposition that thinks carefully about what it will do as government. Where the Opposition have good ideas, or where they can make a contribution to the ideas for improving our country, we welcome them. But we ask that you be upfront about the realities and trade-offs we face as a country, and be honest about your plans, policies and intentions.  Mr Speaker, our world has changed; so too must our way of doing things. Our refreshed social compact will be our compass for the road ahead. Forward Singapore is a bold agenda, and it depends on all of us to realise. Though we will not see change overnight, we can each start to embrace the new social compact today.If we all do this, we can be assured that we, too, will benefit when others feel a deeper sense of responsibility towards us. We can then sustain a virtuous circle of uplift, progress and confidence, and thus strengthen our solidarity and trust as a nation. The more we put into this new social compact, the more we will receive in return. And society as a whole, Singapore, will grow stronger and fairer; more just and more united. Mr Speaker: Order. Leader.',\n",
       " \"Mr Speaker, I rise in support of the Motion. “A Different World, “realities we have to adapt to”, “As a small nation we must take the world as it is”, “challenges” and “opportunities”. These were points highlighted by President Halimah in her speech at the Opening of the second session of this 14th Parliament. But she reminded us that “we are far from powerless”. Our history and what we have achieved as a nation today has shown that our strength has and continues to be our people and our will as one people, government, businesses and citizens “working together to make the improbable possible”.There are many important aspects that President Halimah has covered in her speech and plans that the Ministries have also outlined in the various addenda to her speech. In my speech today, I will touch on two areas which I feel are important for Singapore and Singaporeans to be ready and more importantly, confident for the changes we are facing and to remain relevant now and in the future.They are: one, education and continual learning – to equip Singaporeans and expand opportunities throughout life for all; and two, a society that values and support families.Let me now touch on education and continual learning. For our young: with the fast pace of change and rapid digitalization across many aspects of work and life, what we teach, how we teach and when learning happens has changed and will need to continue to transform.In schools, we are preparing our young for work and careers that do not exist today. The Ministry of Education (MOE)’s addendum to the President’s Address outlines its commitment to quality education and strong foundation for every child while breaking new ground to adapt to the changing landscape.It is heartening that MOE will invest more in preschool education especially for children from disadvantaged families. Studies have shown that access to quality childcare and early childhood education develops foundational skills and helps boost math and reading in children.For our young, building strong foundational knowledge and skills including STEM is crucial. With rapid digitalisation, technology skills need to be part of core curriculum. With how technologies are evolving and the potential benefits and risks they pose, technology skills are essential not only to enable use and leverage of these technologies and tools. Equally important is the understanding of the pros and cons to enable discernment and appropriate use. For example, the benefits of ChatGPT, which everyone has been talking about. ChatGPT gives the ease of use with human-like conversations, extensive applications to produce text, images, music and code – to just name a few.But just last week an article in The Straits Times highlighted what seemed realistic artificial intelligence (AI) generated images that surfaced in recent months and the difficulty to differentiate a fake photo from the real one. There are both benefits and risks as AI and new technologies continue to play a bigger role in our work and lives. With increasing use of technologies, there are rising concerns around privacy, biases and discrimination. Policies are needed to protect, but with a balance so as not to impede the benefits to be derived from these technologies. This is an area that the Government will need to continue to monitor and manage.In a fast-changing landscape and with disruptions, we will need to be agile and adapt quickly. Adapting is not just about being flexible and making changes rapidly but making the right changes. The irony is that in order to deal with changes and to be confident in making the right changes, it will require effort to understand and discern. Acquiring knowledge is essential but not sufficient. The need to analyse data and information, to ask questions and understand in order to use and build on the knowledge is essential. To be adaptable, our students will need to build their problem-solving skills and creativity.With the pace of change and the complexity of the changing landscape, to prepare our students for success, we must also develop them to collaborate well with others and to communicate confidently to articulate their ideas and thoughts.  As outlined in the MOE addendum, how teaching is done in our schools has evolved. An example is Subject-Based Banding which caters to the diverse interest and needs of students by allowing secondary school students to learn subjects based on their strengths and learning needs. To support our students to be able to collaborate and communicate effectively, schools will also need to continue to provide ample opportunity for students to do team-based learning around projects and problem solving. These skills will train our students to collaborate with diverse groups and also require them to communicate effectively. This will prepare our students and give them life skills and the confidence for opportunities in Singapore and overseas both in school and in the future.  Let me now touch on those in the workforce. With people living longer and healthier, our workforce is multi-generational. The needs and experience of workers differ between generations in the workforce. This is an advantage if we are able to tap the diversity of the workforce. I have made this point in several of my speeches in this House that we need to rethink the structure of work to make learning and training systemic for workers of different age groups and stages of life. With change, people of all ages in the workforce will need to acquire knowledge at each stage of their careers and lives. Apart from work, workers have to manage their different obligations and life stages, hence learning has to be organised and accessible both online and hybrid-enabled access to learning to fit the learning needs and the different obligations, life stages and schedules of our workers. COVID-19 has also brought fundamental changes and shown us the possibilities of how work can be organised and where work can be done. These can provide opportunities to attract and retain workers as well as tap a larger pool of talent. But to do so, will require fundamental shifts in mindsets and policies around work arrangements including flexible work arrangements and even retirement age.President Halimah touched on the need for broader and a more open meritocracy to allow every Singaporean to have the opportunity to take on meaningful work that tap on their strengths and to be rewarded fairly for it. I feel that our schools, Institutions of Higher Learning and our SkillsFuture programmes, have and do provide pathways for learning, training, certification and credentials to recognise the skills acquired for our students and those in the workforce. What we need is for businesses and society to recognise skills, competencies and experiences of workers of all ages and qualifications, and not just academic levels of attainment for job opportunities and qualification. Now let me touch on our society and the value of support for families. The family plays an important and central role in our society. The family provides our sense of belonging in society and are our first line of support and care.With an aging population and people living longer, families are multi-generational and caregiving needs will increase. With smaller families, some families need to care for both the young and seniors.Mean-testing qualifying criteria for caregiving support for middle-income Singaporeans may work against some middle-income families that care for their family members. For example, a middle-income household living in a private property taking care of aged parents or siblings may not qualify for any relief or subsidy for eldercare services because of housing type.Let me relate an example from a recent house visit I did. Our resident, Mdm Lee – not her real name – shared with me her worries on the long-term care needs for her brother. Mdm Lee and her husband are in their 60s and do not have children. They live in a terrace house with her brother, aged 65 years old, her sister who is in her 50s and an aged mother in her early 90s. The family are a close-knit family. Mdm Lee's brother suffered from poliomyelitis which affected his speech and mobility and he is unable to care for himself. In fact, during the COVID-19 period, it was really quite trying for this family in terms of caregiving needs.Mdm Lee shared with me that the family do not qualify for any Government subsidies because of housing type. As her husband and her, and her siblings are either retired or nearing retirement, she is worried about affordability for her brother's long-term care when his condition gets worse and he needs to stay in a nursing home. Mdm Lee and her sister currently pay for his medical expenses as he does not have any medical insurance coverage. The irony is that if Mdm Lee's brother or mother did not live with Mdm Lee and lived in a HDB flat, her mother and brother would qualify for support for eldercare services and nursing home. But Mdm Lee and her family believe that staying together contributes to the overall well-being and care of their mother and brother.I appeal for a review of the criteria for qualifications for support for eldercare services and intermediate and long-term to better support families as they care for their loved ones. I am not saying that we discount the means testing, I think that is required. But we need to think about the flexibility and also the circumstances and sometimes, we do it on a case-by-case basis. But as our population is ageing, I think we will have more and more of such scenarios. Mr Speaker, our People are at the core of Singapore's past, present and future. In this complex and rapidly changing world, while the Government has to do more, our businesses, citizens and society too have to do our part. Working as One People, we have been able to weather challenges and emerge stronger. I am confident that as One People, we will move forward together to address challenges and seize opportunities.Mr Speaker: Ms Sylvia Lim.\",\n",
       " 'Mr Speaker, as someone born in the 1960s, my cohort-mates and I find ourselves straddled between our seniors and the young. On the one hand, we are young enough to use many forms of social media, but not young enough to use youth slang like \"OOTD\", outfit of the day, and \"IYKYK\", if you know, you know. [Laughter.] We are old enough to remember the feverish days of the Malaysia Cup; but are a little too old to banter about the latest K-drama heartthrobs – though to be fair, I can name one or two.Thus, placed between seniors and the young, I wish to focus my speech today on these two demographic profiles that bookend society at opposite ends. I wish to ask how we could give greater confidence to seniors and the young, to assure them that they are indispensable parts of our social fabric. Put another way, how do we build a country for all ages?One attitude that will erode solidarity across generations is the tendency towards ageism. Ageisim can be directed against both older people and the young as well. I will touch on these today.First, on seniors. According to the World Health Organization (WHO)\\'s Global Report on Ageism (2021), about one out of every two persons worldwide habours ageist attitudes. Ageism manifests itself in our minds, when we stereotype people based on age; it manifests in our feelings, when we harbour prejudice; and finally, it manifests in our actions, when we discriminate against people.WHO notes that ageism can exist at three levels. First, at the institutional level, when laws, policies and social norms restrict or disadvantage individuals based on age. Second, ageism exists at the interpersonal level, in interactions between two or more individuals. Finally, ageism could be self-directed, when it is internalised by those who are discriminated, who then accept it and behave in ways that make it a self-fulling prophecy.Sir, there is ageism everywhere, though we may not call it such by name. Here are some instances. One of my residents who is 97 and in excellent health, likes to go around asking anyone she meets in Teochew: \"I am 97 years old this year. Are you afraid of me?\" When we hear of someone so senior, some of us would, with good intentions, over-protect the person or assume that the person needs help, without stopping to think that everyone ages differently. We have also come across single elderly people who need to rent rooms to stay due to disagreements with their family but are rejected by landlords in view of their advanced age. Think also of the millions of dollars spent on hair dyes and anti-aging products, so as to present a younger image of ourselves for fear that we might otherwise not be taken seriously. There is also a sexist element to this, where professional men with grey hair are respected but women with grey hair doubted; but that deserves a more detailed discussion on another day.Ageist attitudes are also familiar in the workplace. How often do we hear of middle-aged job-seekers who report that once their age is revealed to the prospective employer, they would receive a polite response to wait for a follow-up call, which does not come? Indeed, in a survey released last March, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) confirmed that ageist attitudes were still prevalent in the Singapore workplace, affecting older workers.The recent global COVID-19 pandemic, too, saw ageism rear its ugly head. A United Nations independent expert, Dr Claudia Mahler, noted that the pandemic restrictions and lockdowns had resulted in a wave of ageist comments and hate speech; older persons were blamed as the reasons for lockdowns and labelled as vulnerable and burdens to societies.To combat ageism, the WHO highlights three strategies: first, through laws and policies; second, through public education and third, by increasing inter-generational contacts. How is Singapore doing in these aspects?At the official or policy level, there are positives in Singapore. We see many health-related initiatives towards active ageing, including the latest Healthier SG initiative. The Government is also looking into more options for seniors to age in place instead of in an institution and for assisted living accommodation that preserves the individual\\'s autonomy to make decisions. Such preservation of an individual\\'s autonomy is a precious tenet that we can also see in legislation such as the Mental Capacity Act (MCA). Under the MCA, donees and deputies must give weight to the preferences of the incapacitated person as far as possible.On the employment front, there are policies to incentivise employers to hire older workers through wage offset schemes such as the Senior Employment Credit. Nevertheless, for stronger protection for all workers, we are still eagerly awaiting the anti-discrimination legislation which the Prime Minister announced nearly two years ago. Apart from laws and policies, the other two strategies that are likely to have more impact are public education and increasing intergenerational contacts.As far as public education is concerned, what more can be done?For our students, we could review our education curriculum from primary to tertiary, to remove any ageist stereotypes and dispel any misconceptions about certain age groups.On employment, I note the efforts of MOM to encourage our employers to hire older employees and embrace multi-generational teams. The Government should always lead by example.Another aspect is to watch our public discourse, including debates in Parliament. Ministers and Members of Parliament should avoid making statements that may inadvertently perpetuate ageism, such as: \"By the year 2030, we will face a silver tsunami\", which evokes all the wrong images.As for increasing intergenerational contacts, I fully support HDB\\'s move to evolve from building blocks with only senior apartments, to having mixed blocks of flats for seniors and flats owned by younger families. This provides opportunities for cross-generation neighbourly activities such as gardening, games and mutual care. Another Singapore initiative was cited positively by the WHO – that of pairing seniors from activity centres with young people to play video games together.Research has shown that the benefits of such intergenerational contacts go beyond reducing ageist attitudes; they also benefit older people in improved health and psychosocial well-being, reducing distress and loneliness. They also strengthen intergenerational solidarity. We should continue to promote more intergenerational contacts.From older people, I next move on to the young. In the President’s Address, she highlighted that youths showed a strong interest to take action and initiate change on issues they cared about. She affirmed that the Government would engage the ideas, dynamism and energy of young Singaporeans.In the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY)’s addendum to the President\\'s Address, it was further stated that the Government would encourage more youths to engage in constructive civic discourse, through platforms such as the Youth Circles and the Youth Action Challenge. MCCY said it would continue to create new platforms to give youth the opportunities to shape Singapore.However, in a TODAY media report the next day, some young people expressed cynicism about existing forms of engagement. Several interviewees argued that the engagement had to go beyond just talking, but should enable young people to have direct participation in governance and policy formulation. One person doubted that the views of young people would be accepted unless those views aligned with the Government’s own ideals.Whatever the views expressed, there was common ground that any engagement should foster in young people a sense of responsibility.I believe it is worthwhile to distill what the priorities of our young citizens actually are. What are the issues young people care about? While the President highlighted mental health and sustainability, it would be wrong to interpret this as meaning that young people only care about “woke” issues such as climate change or discrimination.In my past work as a polytechnic lecturer, I could see in my students concerns about their parents, making ends meet and how to improve themselves and their families’ station in life. In an article published in the Workers’ Party (WP) Hammer last year, WP Youth Wing President Nicole Seah also shared that young people had many concerns that crossed generations, such as the affordability of public housing, cost of raising a family and employment opportunities.We must be careful not to pigeonhole young people’s issues into a handful of areas and only seek to engage them on those. That would be a big turn-off and a disservice to our young.Besides not restricting the areas for youth participation, we must also ask what sort of participation would convince our young people of a direct role in governance and policy-making. There is some indication that the many conversations so far conducted have led to conversation fatigue and skepticism. Cynicism about talking and consultations is understandable, as these are simply input which will eventually either be incorporated or thrown out by decision-makers.Of course, the empowerment of young Singaporeans need not and should not be a top-down affair. Young citizens can and should seize the day, and organise themselves around the causes they care about, adding to the richness of society through such ground-up initiatives.Nevertheless, I believe one change that should be made is to give younger cohorts a direct say in our national elections by lowering the voting age from 21 to 18 years. I raised this matter in this House 16 years ago and most recently again in this year’s Committee of Supply debates. The Government’s consistent response has been \"no\". This is despite Singapore being among a handful of countries in the world that has not reduced its voting age to 18 years, such as Bahrain, Cameroon, Tonga and the UAE. In the Government’s latest response this year, the Minister basically said that those between 18 and 21 years old do not have the skillsets required to cast their votes. I wonder how many citizens agree with this assessment.Sir, it is worthwhile remembering that ageism can equally be directed against the young. To this end, it could be well be argued that when we require male Singaporeans to serve National Service at 18 years, but only permit them to vote at 21 years, this is a form of age-based discrimination.As I said in February, in the 1960s, the movement in the United States to bring down the voting age to 18 years gained momentum when youths below 21 were drafted to fight in the Vietnam War. The slogan ran: “Old enough to fight, old enough to vote!”Sir, let me conclude. For Singapore to fully harness the energy of every citizen, we must foster a dynamic environment where ageist stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination are blown away. This is not something for the Government alone, but requires marshalling the whole-of-society. Each of us needs to examine ourselves too, to see how we individually can contribute to this endeavour in our everyday interactions. If Singapore is to be built to last, we must, together, build a Singapore for all ages.Mr Speaker: Mr Christopher de Souza.',\n",
       " 'Sir, as we move into the second session of Singapore\\'s 14th Parliament, I would like to thank Mdm President for charting out the course ahead as we transition into a different world post-pandemic.Mdm President spoke of the need for our unity and to strengthen our social fabric through emphasis on our core values of fairness, inclusivity, mutual support and giving back to society.One avenue in which we can accomplish this is through expanding opportunities throughout life for all, regardless of individual backgrounds and circumstances. I believe this starts with education.Mdm President spoke of providing every child a good education but not wanting to increase the stresses in an \"educational arms race\". I wholeheartedly agree with this. Earlier this year, during the Budget debate 2023, I spoke on right-sizing our syllabus and increasing affiliations between schools. Today, I would like to elaborate more on that, for I feel it is in-sync with what Mdm President charted out last Monday.On education, firstly, right-sizing our syllabus involves asking ourselves how do we truly want to prepare our young people for a different world they are growing up in. The way our world has changed and keeps changing and with the influx of knowledge and technology and AI, we cannot focus on getting the best test scores or merely having the most knowledge.Increasing affiliations between a primary and secondary school can lift the burden of thinking about which school to go on to after the PSLE. We should not go down the route of an educational arms race. One key way to stop this is to reduce the syllabus. I am not saying it is the only way, but making the syllabus less voluminous will reduce the reliance on tuition to play catch-up. An educational arms race has incentivised a tuition culture. And if we do not stop the race now, our students are going to end up hitting a brick wall. We must avoid that. We must inject the joy of learning instead of reliance on tuition to play catch-up on the syllabus.An educational arms race has built in a tuition culture, where students are caught between doing school homework and tuition homework such that they are possibly, busier on weekends than they are on week days.Secondly, Sir, I would suggest reducing class sizes from 40 to less than 30. MOE\\'s addendum to the President\\'s Address, focuses on being able to better customise teaching and learning for students of differing abilities to bring out the best in each child. I believe one way this can be accomplished is to have a smaller class size to allow teachers to have more time with each student. This can lead to more individualised attention, a greater capacity to monitor each student\\'s physical, mental and emotional well-being and the ability to tailor learning speeds and to cater to different learning styles.Instead of students having to go for tuition, smaller classes can help better pacing, so each student can learn and keep abreast of the subject within class time itself. This can also allow students to have opportunities to speak out and participate more, which would be especially helpful for students who learn as they verbalise.Another focus is helping students with Special Educational Needs in mainstream schools. By reducing class sizes, teachers will have more capacity to assist with the educational experience of these students and to allow the space for interactions between all the students in the class under the teacher\\'s supervision.Of course, reducing class sizes must mean we need more teachers and I believe it will be a step in the right direction. Our teachers choose their profession because of the value they see in raising students to their full potential and derive much intrinsic joy from it. But the tendency for teachers to be overworked and burnt out is known, especially in the past few years where they had to cope with many, many changes.Our teachers go far beyond just the academics as they often counsel students and help those struggling with mental health. By taking on more teachers and reducing class sizes, we can build a better environment, both for students and teachers. That is, at least, in my humble view.In right-sizing our syllabus and having an appropriate class size, we put in place the foundational stepping stones to inculcate in our young, the love of learning. Perhaps, in tweaking our syllabus, that may make way to craft more opportunities for students to visit museums and libraries, and have more moments to play which is essential for creativity.Sir, I move onto my second point. Mdm President encouraged us to move ahead together, even in the face of many changes the world presents us now.Sir, this means caring for the vulnerable. A recent topical concern is protecting our vulnerable citizens from scams. Therefore, Sir, the other issue that deeply concerns me as we progress as a nation is the increasing prevalence of scams. Many of the residents I serve in the constituency, have come to me at the Meet-the-People Session (MPS) or share with me during home visits their distressing stories about how they have lost tens of thousands, if not, hundreds of thousands of dollars to scammers.Prevention involves both building an infrastructure of laws and harnessing technology to detect and dismantle criminal organisations as well as preparing our people, both young and old, to deal with this threat. The scale of this threat cannot be underestimated. The variety of scams – from investment scams to e-commerce scams – all focus on one thing: targeting a specific vulnerability of a targeted group. The scammers are highly sophisticated in directing different scams to different age groups and taking advantage of cognitive biases to psychologically manipulate people into giving more details and transferring larger amounts of money.What accentuates this challenge is the transnational nature of the issue, with 90% of the scams from overseas and how technologically savvy the scammers are in using various digital platforms to carry out the scams. So, to tackle this, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) need to work with the Singaporean public, the banks and our partners from other countries. In particular, I believe we have to double down and raise a proper bulwark with our banking security systems.Instead of just saying what the problem is, I humbly suggest some solutions. These include placing limits on transactions, giving phone calls to owners of bank accounts to ensure they do want to proceed on a transaction, spotting suspicious patterns in consecutive transactions and a kill switch which can be activated by the bank if it detects multiple and suspicious outflows of monies from citizens\\' accounts.In the constituency I serve and when I meet with residents, I have seen physically, bank statements of residents with multiple outflows of monies, just under the transaction limit each time. I have seen bank statements where this happens between 2.00 am and 8.00 am, multiple withdrawals under the limit. And then, when they wake up, the poor residents are $70,000 poorer.This should raise alarm bells and in my view, prompt the bank to halt the transactions altogether until further verification is obtained or at least contact the customer to ensure that these are legitimate withdrawals.We have also to consider the new safeguards we should put in place. For example, e-wallets make transactions far quicker, but do they have the same safeguards in place? I think it is time that we consider what trade-offs we make between advancing \"frictionless\" transactions on the one hand, and putting in place enough safeguards to protect our people.We must look at how we can mitigate the effect of the scam. The Anti-Scam Command has taken the commendable lead in this in freezing 16,700 bank accounts just last year and recovering over $146 million. But that is out of 31,728 scams just in 2022 and over $660 million reported to have been stolen.In addition, I humbly think we also need to consider how we should put in place better support and compensation for those who lose their life savings. For many of the elderly who are scammed, the loss is often at least six figures, which is close to their entire retirement savings. Often, the compensation offered by the bank is insufficient for them to retire on. That would leave many of our seniors having to find more work. That may not be ideal at all if the couple is already in retirement. I really believe this is a group of people we must stand alongside.Sir, with these two priorities in mind in the field of: one, education, and, separately, two, protecting vulnerable groups from scammers, I stand in strong support of the Motion.Mr Speaker: Mr Leon Perera.',\n",
       " 'Mr Speaker, Sir, in my maiden speech in Parliament over seven years ago, I argued that the Singapore glass is half full. While there are always areas for improvement, we have done well with governmental efficiency and urban planning relative to other countries.However, back then I said that we have not done as well in fostering strong non-state actors and institutions to balance a strong state. And I would add now, we have not done as well in fostering a strong sense of participation in our democracy; a sense that we can speak out and, if needed, disagree with the dominant narrative, with our views actually having a chance to make a difference.An article by Tan and Preece in the Asian Journal of Comparative Politics in December last year reads, and I quote, \"We find that mechanisms of diagonal accountability related to media and civil society have declined. Vertical and horizontal accountability remains weak.\" Published research from the book \"The Well-being of Singaporeans\" by Tambyah, Tan and Kay in 2010, reaches similar conclusions. They cite survey data to show that 56% of Singaporeans agree with the statement that, generally speaking, people like me do not have the power to influence Government policy or actions, while another 23% are neutral. Only 20% disagreed.Countries that succeed in drawing strong participation in democracy will be more successful in fostering a confident populace, a people who deeply feel that this is my country, my home, a place where my voice counts for something, a place that I will sacrifice to defend.We all want Singapore to be a country where everyone feels that they have a chance at realising their full potential and giving life to their dreams. A place where tomorrow can be better than today for ourselves and, even more so, for our children and grandchildren. Not a place where many cannot even envisage a better tomorrow; not a place where economic pressure and ever-intensifying competition from school to workplace lead to ever greater stratification in living conditions, social capital and social standing.Sir, the first part of my speech will examine how we can cultivate an active citizenry while keeping politics and political discourse fair, vibrant and constructive. The second part will address how we can build economic optimism, so as to create a virtuous cycle of economic dynamism. The third part will suggest \"a Singapore model\" that can be a beacon for the region and also a bulwark against attempts by great powers to suborn or divide us.Firstly, on politics and political discourse. President Halimah\\'s speech called for \"an active citizenry\" and \"a passionate civil society\". She also spoke of the importance of avoiding political polarisation and gridlock, having trust between \"our political leadership and people\" and keeping political discourse respectful and rational.Such calls are not new. But as I reflected on this, I found that my unease was captured in a public comment from former media editor and academic Bertha Henson. I will quote an excerpt here: \"I am always bemused when I hear politicians warning Singaporeans against such \\'polarisation\\'. Our politics is nowhere as partisan. We do not have a two-party system yet nor a civil society which will take to the streets. Yet, we hear about divisive politics as though we are teetering on the edge of an abyss….I don\\'t think we should be guarding against \\'divisive politics\\' but rather \\'mono-politics\\': that there is only one narrative, one view and it must necessarily be the right or the best perspective – unless you don\\'t trust me. That is too tall an order for any citizen to submit to.\"Let us unpack and interrogate some of these assumptions in what I term \"the dominant narrative\". Firstly, do we want an active citizenry that feels that it is worth participating in politics by speaking out, listening, caring and getting involved in political discourse vs just retreating into private life? I think we should and I hope all hon Members want that. And if we take that ideal seriously, we should never treat differences of opinion as necessarily equivalent to polarisation.Polarisation happens only if some groups of people oppose others for the sake of opposing and not in a reasonable, fair-minded way. Polarisation happens only if vindictiveness and tribalism trump thoughtfulness and basic human decency. No pun intended in the use of the verb \"trump\", by the way.Secondly, disagreement and agreeing to disagree does not imply disrespect. One can disagree with respect, courtesy and decency. It seems that everyone, nowadays, welcomes that well-worn phrase \"robust debate\". But we do sometimes hear in this House that the other side has not explained the trade-offs properly and, therefore, was being dishonest in some sense.During very major recent debates in this House, the Opposition explained how there were alternatives to a GST hike that would slow the rate of growth of reserves; and that there were alternatives to a housing ecosystem based on the promise of asset appreciation and that these alternatives would lead to some weakening in the resale market.Were those trade-offs denied, hidden, glossed over? No. The trade-offs were explained. I think in our political discourse and even in our debates in this House, we should strive to treat Members\\' views and other parties\\' views fairly and accept when there is a philosophical or ideological difference, call it what you will, rather than being too quick to label the other side as \"disingenuous\". Such labels can affect the tone of discourse in the wider society, if alternative ideas become demonised or labelled uncharitably. Rather than chip away at trust in the Opposition with such labels, the Government should focus on explaining why it disagrees with the Opposition.Thirdly, on the need to keep political discourse rational, I do not think anyone would disagree with this. However, to have rational political discourse, we need transparency of information. We do not always get this. There are many examples of Parliamentary Questions that do not elicit the information requested without an explanation as to why that is the case. Sometimes, outcomes of public consultation are not made public. There is a great deal of public opinion surveying done by the Government, some of it through opinion-sensing agencies like Rysense, for example. Not all of this is made available for public scrutiny and debate.Lastly, I come to the oft-repeated call for trust in Government. I think trust in the independent institutions of the state is a very good thing, where it is warranted. But should the public blindly trust the Government as in the political leadership, regardless of whether relevant information has been shared; regardless of what the Government says or does? Surely not. That goes against the active citizenry which the President\\'s speech referred to.Sir, some speak of a democracy of deeds. But surely, we do not want a citizenry that is active in deeds, but blind, apathetic or timid in thinking. Such a citizenry may engage in the wrong deeds. And to trust the Government – does that mean that, since the Government and Opposition sometimes disagree and not, hopefully, irrationally, does that mean that it is right that the public distrust the Opposition? Surely not.We should not strive for a political landscape where the public innately trusts the Government, but innately distrusts the Opposition or vice versa. If any Member disagrees with this, please, I would love to hear your views later. We should strive, rather, for a politically educated populace that accords trust based on facts and evidence from independent institutions that function as intended.What can we do to strengthen everyone\\'s confidence that we have an open society, where citizens can and should care, listen, understand and debate policies? How can we make everyone believe that there is a more level-playing field for ideas, and not primarily one dominant narrative that you would do well not to challenge?In the interest of time, I will suggest just a few ideas to advance towards this goal which WP Members of Parliament (MPs) have expanded on in previous debates in this House.One, delink the People\\'s Association from the ruling party. The current system creates a sense that state resources are invested in promoting the Government\\'s thinking and the ruling party\\'s politicians, which unlevels the playing field for politics and ideas in our nation. My hon friend, Aljunied MP, Mr Faisal Manap, will elaborate on this.Two, create an ombudsman with investigative capacity to strengthen confidence that the state and ruling party are accountable and cannot simply shut down a grievance that may be politically costly or for other reasons. At the very least, a second unbiased opinion would be of value. I have argued for this at length previously, as have other WP MPs.Three, ensure that funding for civil society, the arts and so on is handled by independent committees who are not linked to the Government of the day. This would certainly help build the passionate civil society that President Halimah spoke of and counter any fears that civil society groups that advocate alternative policies to the Government may be penalised using state resources.Four, since we do not have a Freedom of Information Act, we should publish every single public opinion poll and data collection effort conducted with state funds, redacted only for anything that has clear and strong commercial or national security sensitivities for better-informed debate amongst political parties, civil society groups and citizens.Five, allow Opposition MPs to engage school students in their MP capacity, alongside ruling party MPs and Ministers, a subject I have raised in this House before. We need to mould the mental habits of our citizens from a young age to nurture independent, critical thinking.Exposing them only to People\\'s Action Party (PAP) politicians in schools and barring non-PAP ones in most student engagement contexts does not achieve this. Our future citizens need to be able to see both sides of a question, in a way that will inoculate them from the demagogues and foreign interference attempts of the future.Sir, we must not allow any sense to congeal that there is one dominant narrative and that everyone who has a different view has to be marginalised or go on the defensive.I now come to the second part of my speech on the optimism of Singaporeans. Will tomorrow be better than today?According to the 2023 Edelman Trust Barometer survey, only 36% of respondents in Singapore felt that their families will be better off economically in five years\\' time, only 36%, the lowest level for this measure since Edelman started surveying 23 years ago. This 36% for Singapore compares with the 40% global average across 24 countries.Sir, the Leader of the Opposition spoke of the risk of there becoming two Singapores. Right now, close to 50% of households live in 5-room HDB flats or more expensive homes, private homes and so on. A little over 50% live in 4-, 3-, 2- or 1-room HDB flats.At the risk of oversimplification, those who live in less expensive homes may be the ones feeling the economic anxiety and pessimism that the Edelman survey measures. They may struggle to compete in the workplace or academia, especially if they did not receive the inherited advantages of wealth or social capital that President Halimah spoke of. The elderly on fixed or no incomes have to grapple with rising food prices. Whereas others, the optimistic 36%, may feel that they can thrive in this very competitive society with high prices and expensive homes.In fact, poverty and social inequality ranked as the third big area of concern in a national survey done in 2020 by Ipsos, after jobs and healthcare. At this point, I declare my interest as the Chairman of a Singapore company that undertakes market research and consulting.Sir, when we have discussions like this, it is often pointed out that real wages are still growing. But the Edelman survey, plus a great deal of anecdotal experience from my conversations with Singaporeans in the Serangoon ward of Aljunied Group Representation Constituency (GRC) and East Coast GRC previously, suggest that this anxiety is very real. Many fear that the way food, house and other prices are rising, the way the job market is becoming more competitive, those with fewer advantages will truly struggle to build a tomorrow that is better than today.Also, we should recall that real wage data may mask some things. Real wages may appear to be rising but that may mask the fact that certain demographic groups may feel the pain of inflation more than others.Previously in the House, I have called for Consumer Price Index (CPI) data to be published by demographic group, for example, parents with young children or empty nesters, as inflation affects these groups differently. Also, within each income decile, there will be those who do less well than the median for that decile.And lastly, the Edelman survey shows that whatever the real wage growth data suggests, the thinking of many Singaporeans about the future reflects a lack of confidence that they can thrive going forward.This economic pessimism could be one reason for our globally low total fertility rate, or TFR. In the previous housing debate, I also cited academic evidence for a causal link between high home prices and low TFR in Singapore. If left to fester, such economic pessimism could lead to a brain drain as people leave for more liveable countries. If that happens, that may tend to create over-reliance on foreign manpower.We need to address this economic pessimism fundamentally, not only through ad hoc measures such as an additional grant here or an additional rebate there, helpful as that is. More far-reaching reforms are needed to make everyone believe that this society has their back. The WP has called for many such reforms in the past. In the interest of time, I shall not expand on these, but I shall refer to them. One, a national minimum wage. Two, a redundancy insurance scheme. This is something the WP has championed for some time and I was intrigued by Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong’s reference to some form of unemployment support. Three, seriously tackling the issue of poverty and breaking the poverty cycle. I have called for a war on poverty in this House. My hon friend Assoc Prof Jamus Lim has also weighed in on this topic yesterday, as have other WP MPs over the years. Four, reforming the Housing and Development Board (HDB) housing system to lower Build-To-Order (BTO) prices by revisiting the formula for land valuation as well as introducing various other reforms, as we argued in the recent housing debate. Five, revamping trades or vocational jobs to overhaul them for higher productivity, pay and conditions. I have spoken about this in the House several times.Lest anyone say that the trade-offs have not been explained, these ideas taken togethe,r will slow the rate of growth of reserves but will not draw down reserves. I believe slowing down the growth of reserves is wholly justified at this stage of our nation’s history, given the needs we have with an ageing population in a turbulent world and given the much larger size of reserves now versus GDP, as they were in the past. My WP colleagues and I have explained this repeatedly, on multiple platforms. We must invest to ensure a confident current generation, lest our fertility go so low that there will be few people in the generations to come.Sir, before I move on, I want to refer to Deputy Prime Minister Wong’s comment yesterday that the Opposition should offer concrete alternative policy ideas.We have been doing this. We offer alternative policies that differ substantively from the ideas of the PAP, for example, on slowing reserves growth to enhance liveability, social justice and social mobility and reducing BTO prices based on tweaks to the land valuation formula. The alternatives we have championed in Parliament, in our manifesto are too numerous for me to mention here. I only have 20 minutes. In fact, I only have less than five minutes left. We championed an expansive acute hospital bill insurance scheme and permanently delinking BTO from resale prices long before this was adopted by the PAP Government. We championed anti-discrimination legislation and redundancy insurance, policies that the PAP are now considering in some form. The Deputy Prime Minister and the PAP know this. They know it. Sir, I have a sense of déjà vu now, recalling how I was debating a similar issue about what the PAP said about our housing paper in this House just a few weeks ago. [Deputy Speaker (Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo) in the Chair]Mdm Deputy Speaker, let us be honest in our political debates. Honest. Not going for false but flashy soundbites that smear our opponents, that the media then viralise with huge headlines. I do not want my children to grow up in a post-truth society.Mdm Deputy Speaker, I come now to the third and last part of my speech, about the development of a Singapore model that can inspire the world.As I said in my maiden speech, we have got certain fundamentals right. The glass is half full. Let us fill in the other half with measures to enhance our active citizenry, civil society and engaged, rational politics.This thinking can extend to regional leadership in economic projects. Such projects can be designed to reflect Singaporean values of good corporate governance and efficiency, but also incorporating consultation and engagement with civil society and other stakeholders. And the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for such projects could advance goals like poverty alleviation, reflecting Singaporean values of egalitarianism and inclusivity.Singapore has positioned itself as a leader in economic openness, having the most free trade agreements (FTAs) in the region. But one of our distant competitors is putting a twist on this approach. The UAE’s diplomacy focuses on playing a supporting role to Saudi Arabia, Egypt and so on, who have much bigger populations and armies, even as the UAE positions itself as the business gateway to the Arab World and Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.But the UAE has taken this a step further. It invests in overseas assets with a very outsized investment in renewables. The scale of this is extremely large – just the renewables arm of one of their sovereign wealth funds have targeted 100 gigawatts of renewables at home and abroad by 2030, quadrupling the current commitment and being worth around US$100 billion. By comparison, Temasek-linked Sembcorp’s 2025 target is 10 gigawatts; Keppel’s is seven gigawatts.An example of UAE “dealplomacy” is where its government-owned renewables business, Masdar, committed to a 10-gigwatt mega-wind farm in Egypt in a deal on COP27’s sidelines, which would save Egypt $5 billion in annual gas costs and offset about 9% of its emissions. In comparison, Singapore has supported renewable energy companies’ expansion into the region and internationally, but largely on a commercial, non-diplomatic basis.Why green investments as the backbone of these regional leadership efforts? Because green energy is cheap, lasting, critical and has the potential to make a far-reaching impact.IRENA estimates that if Southeast Asia were to build enough renewables to cut energy-related carbon dioxide emissions, it could also save US$160 billion as well as $1.5 trillion in health and environmental costs related to fossil fuels by 2050. But to pull this off, $7 trillion in investment is needed from now till then.In 2018, I spoke in this House about the idea of Singapore leading a flagship project in the region on renewable energy or some such theme to serve multiple economic and diplomatic ends. Such projects need not be primarily government financed but can raise financing in capital markets globally. Leading and catalysing such a regional flagship project will help bolster —Mdm Deputy Speaker: Mr Perera, you have a minute. Please round up your speech. ',\n",
       " 'Yes, I am tracking the time. One minute. Leading and catalysing such a regional flagship project will help bolster Singapore’s economy and also Singapore’s soft power in the ASEAN region, a region which has a potentially important historical destiny, namely that of a bulwark and zone of buffering and balancing between the great powers of China and the West.And what if Singapore demonstrates how its traditional bureaucratic efficiency can be combined with policies that ensure openness, accountability and democratic ownership among an active citizenry? That could serve as a good example for this vital region that will inspire emulation and perhaps help form an ASEAN identity around such principles. [Applause.]Mdm Deputy Speaker: Minister Chan Chun Sing. ',\n",
       " 'Mdm Deputy Speaker, thank you very much. I just wish to make a point of clarification for Ms Sylvia Lim\\'s speech. I heard her saying that the Government says that, essentially, we say that people under 21 years old did not have the skills to vote. May I check, when did we say this?Because if I am right, I just checked the Hansard, on 24 February 2023 in my reply to Ms Sylvia Lim\\'s question. I said, \"If we look at the rights and responsibility of all our people from the ages of 16 until 21, there is a gradation of scale. At different ages they have different rights and different responsibilities.\" Mdm Deputy Speaker: Ms Sylvia Lim.',\n",
       " 'Mdm Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the Motion. As part of our Forward Singapore conversation, much has been discussed about refreshing our social compact.This has also been the central issue at this debate, including in the speeches of the President, Deputy Prime Minister Wong and various Members.Many have asked: what is a social compact? Others asked: what is our social compact?A social compact is simply our responsibilities towards one another; how we reward work and distribute the fruits of labour and success; and how we relate to and respect one another. So, three \"R\"s – our responsibilities towards one another; how we reward work and distribute the fruits of our success; and how we relate to and respect one another.Central to the Singapore social compact has been meritocracy. People are recognised based on merit and achievements. We aspire as a nation for all to progress through our abilities, rather than birth rights, family connections or inherited wealth. These principles have brought us this far. It has spurred our people to excel individually. It has allowed us to accomplish much collectively. Indeed, for a new country of immigrants, there did not and does not seem to be a better set of organising principles for people to operate within and excel. Many of our forefathers came to Singapore because this was a place that allowed them to realise their dreams, despite their starting circumstances and lack of connections.Many of us are also here today because of the opportunities afforded to us by this system of meritocracy. This includes Members from all sides of the House.Other systems, such as aristocracy, plutocracy and nepotism, serve the interests of the few, rather than of the many. These other systems would not have similarly motivated our people to aspire and strive, nor helped us to attract the best and brightest to commit their future to Singapore.While meritocracy has allowed us to avoid some of these pitfalls, it is now under stress worldwide. There are increasing questions if meritocracy is indeed fair. Or can it be fair, especially over the long term? The process is also questioned by some who are unhappy with the outcomes.To fix the problems, some real and some perceived, various countries have tried to fix the process in different ways. Some countries have tried affirmative action for the less privileged groups, by levelling the uneven playing field in resources and opportunities for the less privileged groups.It sounds fine, until we have to figure out who gets to decide who are the less privileged and what opportunities we should set aside for them. It becomes even more complicated when everyone feels relatively deprived or less privileged from their own perspectives.While meritocracy has generally worked well for Singapore so far, we also acknowledge that our system is not perfect.We must recognise that meritocracy, by itself, is not a panacea for all of our societal challenges. Let me list a few potential pitfalls; and suggest what we must do to keep our meritocracy sustainable and resilient.First, as the world and our society evolve, our needs are constantly changing. Indeed, our relevance and competitiveness as a country depend on our ability to evolve with the times.Hence, meritocracy based on any single, static and narrow metric for talent and ability, will not allow us to build a resilient society with a diversity of strengths to meet tomorrow\\'s challenges.As society matures, those who have succeeded under the previous and existing metrics, will tend to want to perpetuate the same set of yardsticks – sometimes, to preserve their personal interests and comfort; sometimes, they assume that what has worked will continue to work in a different future and do not think of alternatives that society may need going forward. We must not allow any single, static and narrow metric to define success which can easily cause our society to stagnate and become irrelevant.The second danger of meritocracy, beyond competing on a static and narrow metric, is to reward success based on fixed, defined, and pre-determined points in life and time. Once the determining test is conducted and the results are known, then it is as if the life trajectories of our people are fixed and become too difficult to change. This cannot be our society. People develop at different paces and demonstrate different abilities at different times. For society to allow everyone to do justice to their gifts, we must have a system of continuous meritocracy, where no single test or point in time determines the rest of one\\'s life. This continuous meritocracy must extend beyond the education system, throughout life.  Employers and society have as much a part to play to recognise the skills and talents of our people; and not fall into the trap of credentialism of using any single dated metric. We must ensure that there is porosity in the ways that people can earn their spurs, contribute throughout life and allow them to bounce back from setbacks.The third danger of meritocracy is stratification over time.It is natural and perhaps inevitable that the successful will tend to mix amongst themselves, creating exclusive social circles instead of sharing social capital. It is also human nature to want to pass on our wealth and privileges to our children, be it through the accumulation of assets, like investments and property, or through access to additional education resources, like tuition.But these natural tendencies risk creating an endowment effect in society. Access to opportunities and rewards could increasingly be determined not just by the merits of this generation, but the transfer of wealth and privileges from the previous generations.Meritocracy becomes harder and harder for the less privileged, as their relative start state falls further and further behind the privileged.We must not leave this unchecked, or this will progressively stratify society, undermining our cohesion and eroding our higher purpose to draw on the talents and capabilities from all in society, instead of the privileged few. The fourth danger of meritocracy is the misplaced belief that one\\'s success is attributed entirely to one\\'s talent and hard work, without acknowledging the role that society has played in enabling the person to succeed; the need for them to give back, uphold the system and strengthen our society; and the need to continually push back against the forces of social stratification.To keep our Singaporean meritocracy resilient and sustainable, this Government, together with our people, will focus on six key strategies.First, we value our people\\'s diverse abilities.We will continue to move away from evaluating our people\\'s diverse abilities by any single, static, and narrow metric – be it the PSLE results, grade-point averages, or whether they hold a degree or diploma.Take Full Subject-based Banding. With the implementation of Full Subject-based Banding next year, our education system will become more flexible and provide multiple pathways to cater to different learner profiles. Students will have the flexibility to pursue different subjects at different subject levels, which allows them to customise their learning in each subject to a pace suited for them, while developing other areas of interest. This, coupled with our plans to leverage educational technologies such as AI-enabled adaptive learning systems, will help to provide more customised learning experiences for all our students.We are also broadening the pathways in which students can access their education. With more opportunities for Direct School Admission and aptitude-based admissions, our students will be able to pursue studies based on their passion and aptitude rather than purely academic performance. We will continually review our admission policies to ensure that our schools remain open and accessible for students from diverse backgrounds while balancing other competing needs, such as preserving community ties and maintaining a variegated education landscape to cater to different students\\' needs.  We will press on with our efforts to develop 21st century competencies in all our students so that they can thrive amidst constant changes in our world. Our curriculum will continue to be refreshed regularly to meet our students\\' future needs. We will continue to emphasise important life skills and free up time and space for schools to strengthen learning dispositions and holistic development. This will allow our students to develop an empowering portfolio of skills that will serve them well whatever they end up doing, including adaptability, resilience and the ability to think critically and inventively. To these ends, we need the support of parents. As parents, we must welcome schools to have their unique value propositions. This can better cater to the diverse needs of our children and help them to realise their full potential. Hence, it is not necessary or meaningful for us to constantly compare why one school\\'s offering may be slightly different from another\\'s.  The more appropriate question is not \"Is this a good school?\" but \"Is this a good or appropriate school for my child?\"As parents, we must also not fall into the trap of allowing broader dimensions of merit to translate into greater pressure to chase down more and every yardstick to \"beat the crowd\". We must remember that broader dimensions of merit are meant to help our children fulfil their potential according to their diverse strengths and interests. This is not meant to provide more ways to compare our children with others in areas that are not suited for their strengths or interests.We must remember to teach our children that it is more important to surpass themselves throughout life than to surpass someone else in an examination.Second, we will continue to create more diverse education pathways to allow greater porosity throughout life.Building on efforts like Full Subject-Based Banding in MOE schools, our post-secondary and tertiary pathways will provide more flexibility to better support students\\' learning and progression.For example, polytechnic students will be able to spread out their learning if they intend to pursue side interests or need more time to build up a stronger academic foundation. ITE\\'s enhanced curricular structure will cater to a diverse range of learner profiles. Those who graduate with a Higher Nitec can look forward to further upgrading opportunities, such as the expanded offerings of ITE\\'s Work-Study Diplomas.Our publicly funded university degrees will also have a higher lifetime cohort participation rate so that more Singaporeans can look forward to obtaining a degree from our autonomous universities, not necessarily before starting work but at some point in their working lives. Third, we will invest in our people throughout life, not just in the first 15 years when they are with us in our schools, but also for the next 50 years beyond our schools. Our people will need to continually upskill and reskill across their lifetimes to evolve at their own speed, create new value and stay ahead of the competition. To support this, the Government has increased its investment in recent years in Continuing Education and Training (CET), including through the national SkillsFuture movement. We will not stop here. We will intensify our efforts to help our people stay relevant and competitive.As part of the Forward Singapore exercise, we will announce more details in due course on how we intend to help our workforce to upskill and remain relevant throughout life.  Amongst the various ideas are more targeted training support for mid-career workers, including SkillsFuture Credit top-ups and how we make training more accessible for working adults with competing commitments and responsibilities.But the Government\\'s efforts alone will not be enough. We will need the partnership of industry, the innovation of institutions and the growth mindset of individuals.Industries cannot wait passively for the perfect worker to be developed for them. They must be active partners in shaping students\\' interests and skillsets even before they enter the workforce. Hence, I welcome more companies to partner our schools in our Applied Learning Programmes.  After that, industries must also be prepared to invest the time and resources to support our workers to upskill continually.  I can understand the challenges for industries to commit to the training of our workers, especially in uncertain times. But if we do not grow our own timber collectively, we will all be fighting over a stagnant talent and skills pool.The Public Service, as an employer, will lead by example in supporting our workers to upskill continually.Our IHLs will continue to innovate and enhance their programme offerings, including through work-study programmes and stackable modules that may be more suitable for mid-career Singaporeans who wish to upgrade their skills. At the same time, our people will need to develop a growth mindset and passion for lifelong learning to make full use of these opportunities.We will need this whole-of-society effort to enable our people to stay relevant and our industries to stay competitive in an ever more challenging environment.Fourth, not only must we respect a variety of professions, we must also fairly reward and remunerate the \"heart\" and \"hand\" work that is commensurate with the \"head\" work. Our society needs all these roles to complement one another to function well.As an example, MOE is reviewing the remuneration and career progression pathways in the Special Education sector to strengthen the professional development of our special needs educators and improve the quality of services to better support students with special education needs.  We must ensure that our special needs educators who serve in diverse and demanding environments are recognised and appreciated for their efforts and contributions and for the challenging work that they do. We must also ensure that our special needs professionals have professional development opportunities, just like mainstream MOE teachers.Indeed, there should be much more cross-pollination of ideas and mutual support between the mainstream and special needs educator fraternity and, similarly, within the special needs education sector.  I hope to have the support of all Singaporeans for us to move in this direction.MOE and MSF will work closely with all our social service agencies to achieve this vision for the benefit of our special needs professionals and our special needs community. We will need to work together. We can achieve more collectively to better take care of the professionals in this sector instead of just thinking of optimising individually in respective institutions.Beyond MOE, other workplaces that involve \"hand\" and \"heart\" work, including those in the essential services sectors, also need to play their part. They need to hire, train and reward workers fairly based on skills and competencies. But we all know that this may translate into higher costs for some services provided by our fellow Singaporeans, which our society must be willing to accept and support. Otherwise, no matter how much we broaden the definitions of merit in our school system, none of it will ultimately work because it does not translate into tangible differences in earnings and at the workplace.Fifth, as a society, we must always do more for those with less to uplift the less privileged. This has been and this will continue to be the guiding principle behind this Government\\'s policies.That is why we set up the Uplifting Pupils in Life and Inspiring Families Taskforce (UPLIFT) to rally the community to partner our schools in helping students from disadvantaged backgrounds to progress educationally and to achieve their full potential. That is also why we have a progressive tax system to contribute to the running of such initiatives.Everyone bears part of the responsibility, but those with more, bear more, and those with less, get more.This is also why we want to do more for the less privileged in terms of housing, retirement adequacy, healthcare and many other areas. This helps us to ensure that the gaps in society are not too stark, opening us up to the politics of envy and threatening the harmony of our society. It also helps us to avoid the need for affirmative action to decide who should or should not be given opportunities based on who they are rather than what they can do and what they can be.However, we must never degenerate into a system where everyone thinks they deserve more relative to others. Indeed, I see this as one of our major challenges. I fear a day when we constantly feel a sense of relative deprivation from seeing someone else getting more help than us instead of feeling a sense of gratitude at being helped or feeling a sense of satisfaction at being able to help someone else. We will then lose our social cohesion to the politics of envy.  Perhaps, we need to regularly remind ourselves that it is more blessed to give than if we are to just receive. As the Chinese say – 施比受更为有福. The ultimate measure of our success as a society is not how many people we can help because they are unable to keep up, but how few people we need to help because we have enabled them to thrive. A sustainable and resilient meritocracy is one where the largest possible number of people are enabled to achieve and contribute to take care of the fewest number possible who are unable to achieve as much. The ultimate measure of our success as a society is not how many people we can help because they are unable to keep up but how few people we need to help because we have enabled them to thrive.Sixth, we need to imbue the right values in all our people from young so that they can grow to become individuals who are willing to give back to society and create more opportunities for others.All of us must recognise that our individual success is never just due to our own abilities and hard work, that without the opportunities that society provided us and the help from others along the way, we may not be where we are here today. So, even as we celebrate and enjoy the fruits of our own labour, we must not forget to give back to society and others around us, to share the networks and ties that have helped us so that others may also similarly benefit from the opportunities and access.Today, our schools already facilitate this sharing of social capital across different schools. Through cluster-based programmes like co-curricular activities, Values in Action initiatives and other holistic development programmes, students from different schools can come together, get to know one another, learn how to communicate and collaborate with one another and form friendships that go beyond their own schools.Going forward, we will further strengthen our school cluster system to enable better pooling and sharing of resources and allow more students to benefit from wider networks and build their social capital. We can do more of these through co-curricular activities, Values in Action programmes and even selected curriculum. We encourage everyone in society to partner us in these efforts. Contribute your time and talent, beyond treasures. Show our students the way forward and help to nurture a more giving generation in time to come. Share your networks and opportunities with the next generation of students, not just in your alma mater but in other schools as well, to help them succeed like you did.I, therefore, call on the alumni of the more established schools to come forward, to step forward, to join hands with us, to contribute to the wider community of schools so that we can all progress together, faster and better.This is something that all of us who have gone through the system and succeeded can and should do.Some may ask – what can I contribute if I am not as successful? If I did not come from a school with a more illustrious history? If I do not earn a big salary, wear expensive clothes, live in a big house or drive a fancy car? My answer is simply this – those material achievements are not the only yardsticks of success nor should they define our ability to contribute. Neither should they determine the respect and dignity that one deserves.  Instead, we must define success by how much we contribute to others and the greater good and not just how much we achieve for ourselves. We should have the courage to step up and say, \"I can always contribute something, according to my abilities, regardless of where I am in life\". And everyone can say that and can do something about that. I look forward to the day when our society defines success not just by one’s achievements, but more importantly by one’s contributions. When a true son and daughter of Singapore who earns and deserves our respect is one whose contributions not only commensurate with his or her achievements, but also one who contributes to the best of his or her abilities. Mdm Deputy Speaker, let me conclude. In an increasingly volatile and uncertain environment, we need to avoid over-structuring our system and processes to give our people a false sense of security while eroding their development to handle an uncertain and untidy world. Instead, we must provide multiple pathways with diverse metrics of success while equipping our people with the life skills they need to thrive in the 21st century, to allow our people to chart their own way forward according to their own strengths and talents.In an increasingly competitive world, we can easily fall into the trap of always looking at the right side of the bell curve and feeling eternally inadequate. Instead, we must remind ourselves of our gifts and responsibilities to help those who are less privileged than us.In an increasingly unequal and uncertain world, we need to strengthen our sense of solidarity and collective assurance without eroding the individual’s responsibility and sense of agency. We must come together as individuals, as partners, as employers and as a community to celebrate diverse forms of abilities and contributions, to recognise and respect the dignity of those who contribute in different ways to society, to help everyone upskill continually and move up the ladder throughout our lifetimes and to give back to society and others who have helped us along the way.Finally, the Singapore Story is a living story. Do not be taken by hubris to think that we have \"arrived\" or can ever \"arrive\" and need not evolve or improve anymore. We understand the merits of our system and how far it has helped us to come this far as a society by unleashing our potential as individuals. Yet, we are not complacent to think that we can ever stop improving our system. Any living system that does not grow will wither.The mark of our success is not just how well we enable this generation to achieve success but how well we establish the conditions for the next generation to be even more successful than us. Only so will we be able to continuously write new chapters of the Singapore Story.There may never be a perfect system to develop all the perfect students or workers for our societal needs. But we can all contribute our part to build a better or less imperfect system to continually inspire our people and all who believe in our dream to build a resilient and sustainable meritocratic system to bring out the best from all, to be a beacon of cohesion with unity of purpose in a troubled world, a society with a sense of collective responsibility towards one another, a society with respect for diverse abilities, a society that rewards hard work and talent, a society that recognises contributions beyond achievements, a society with gratitude for our blessings to want to do good for all beyond ourselves.And, finally, a nation confident to defy the odds of history to survive and thrive beyond SG100. [Applause.]Mdm Deputy Speaker: Mr Don Wee.',\n",
       " 'Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. In fact, I had raised my hand with Deputy Speaker because I also went back to check and I realised that my recollection of the response was not quite accurate. So, I accept what Minister has said – he did not say that the people between 18 and 21 did not have the skillsets to vote, but what he said was that there is a different rights and responsibilities for people between 16 and 21.But I believe the question still remains, as to whether those between 18 and 21 should be empowered to vote. I apologise for recollecting wrongly.Mdm Deputy Speaker: Minister Chan. ',\n",
       " 'I thank Ms Lim for the clarification. Indeed, we have not said that.Mdm Deputy Speaker: Mr Patrick Tay. ',\n",
       " \"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the Motion to thank Mdm President for her address at the Opening of the second session of the 14th Parliament.  Mdm President has reiterated the importance of ensuring a broader and more open meritocracy that works well for all Singaporeans; one in which no one feels left behind. Whether it is in education or employment, the Government has made positive and concerted efforts to promote meritocracy.  As a labour MP, I have been lobbying in the past years against discrimination and have been part of the efforts in the Tripartite Committee on Workplace Fairness to uphold the principles of fair and merit-based employment in Singapore. The interim report and update was recently issued and I look forward to seeing this piece of legislation next year when it is introduced in Parliament.The issue of age discrimination and ageism as highlighted by hon Member Sylvia Lim is one area which will be addressed in this piece of legislation. In the education front, I can see the efforts at levelling the playing field and providing opportunities for all to maximise their full potential in the entire learning continuum from mainstream to adult education and continuing education and training both in and outside of employment.  Yesterday, the WP through hon Member Gerald Giam proposed through-train schools for the first 10 years. This is not a new idea, as my fellow MOE Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) member and former Chair, hon Member Denise Phua, has suggested almost a decade ago and on different occasions. MOE during the Committee of Supply had explained considerations to right-site our students according to their learning needs and the associated challenges of implementation that we must carefully consider. There are also those who want to retain the PSLE and want to have a choice of the secondary school they want to enter at some interval. Likewise, with subject-based banding, to be rolled out across all secondary schools in due course, will allow students to discover and pursue their passions and interests while deepening their strengths and abilities, and have a more structured and less painful process for learning. We do not want an arms race or more stress due to examinations. We also do not want to cram children with even more content as character and values are equally, if not more, important. I am glad we have made significant changes to the education system and must continue to do so to improve. I therefore agree and support what Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong mentioned in his speech yesterday on our refreshed meritocracy, which is a continuous one with learning opportunities, milestones, ladders at multiple junctures through this learning continuum. It therefore holds true that it remains a treadmill journey and we need to constantly evolve and find new and innovative ways to imbue the love for learning in everyone, foster a lifelong learning culture and ensure our people stay ready, relevant and resilient – ready to do better, relevant to move forward in life and resilient to try again.In my recent contribution to ETHOS, a publication of the Civil Service College, I reiterated the importance of adopting a mindset of lifelong learning to address the issue of skills mismatch. SkillsFuture, the national movement to provide Singaporeans with the opportunities to develop their fullest potential throughout life regardless of their starting points, is Singapore's initiative towards inculcating that mindset and embedding it within our culture.We have already seen how SkillsFuture has paid off for businesses. Results from a study conducted by SkillsFuture Singapore and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) showed that companies which tap on SkillsFuture to fund eligible training expenses report revenue benefits and higher productivity. Our research in the Labour Movement also revealed that majority of business leaders have observed positive changes in their workers post-training, such as higher performance at work and being able to take on new job responsibilities. These findings are promising, and we certainly hope that all businesses will provide their workers that access to quality continuing education and training (CET) and upgrading opportunities. The Labour Movement will continue its work in advocating that employers provide adequate training support for their workers so that they may tap on opportunities that arise in the new economy and ensure a just transition for all.However, I feel we can do more for the individual Singaporean in ensuring that this system that supports lifelong learning works for them too. The vision to strengthen our SkillsFuture ecosystem such that everyone is enabled to do significant skills reboot during their working lives is one that I firmly believe in.Madam President shared that such a skills reboot would help to keep Singaporeans employable or transit across to jobs in new areas of growth. I wholeheartedly agree with this.  What the entire SkillsFuture programme does is that it provides us access to a toolbox. Call it a CET toolbox – a collection of educational courses and training programmes that are meant to support and equip us on this journey of lifelong learning, enabling us to accomplish skills mastery and even second-skilling ourselves. Just like the SkillsFuture Credit which arms every Singaporean citizen from the age of 25 with this toolbox. However, not all of them open this toolbox, much less use it.  Anecdotally, through my engagements with workers as well as with residents, this could be attributed to two reasons. First, there are just too many options for training programmes out there. Second, there is a perceived lack of guarantee that undergoing training would result in tangible outcomes for the individual's career in terms of wages and progression. Returning to my toolbox analogy, what this means is that: first, there are just too many tools in our toolbox, leading to confusion; and two, a lack of knowledge on how using a certain tool or a combination of tools would help us accomplish certain tasks, revealing a lack of clarity or information asymmetry.  The next question, then, is a straightforward one – how can we help Singaporeans navigate these tools, cut through the analysis paralysis, resolve the paradox of choice and have the confidence that the utilisation of these tools would empower them with the means to fix a leaky pipe, replace a light switch or assemble a table and become the version of the skilled tradesperson that they have always aspired to be? In other words, how can we tighten the nuts and bolts of our SkillsFuture ecosystem to generate outcomes that will ultimately be beneficial for Singaporeans and their careers and, eventually, our economy?  Our workforce is made up of workers of varied profiles and it is imperative that we adopt a more targeted lifelong learning strategy for different worker segments to ensure that everyone has fair access to opportunities, a level playing field for jobs, while, at the same time, balancing companies' manpower needs in the immediate and longer term to achieve equitable outcomes. We have skills frameworks and annual reports on skills in demand which are very instructive and useful. But I opine that a more individualised and speed to market approach is needed so that time and resources spent on training and skills upgrading lead to clear outcomes in terms of wages and career progression and ensure every worker stays employed and employable.  There is a way to enable this targeted lifelong learning strategy by tapping on the expertise of career coaches and counsellors. Professional, industry-accredited career coaches and counsellors work with us to explore our strengths and weaknesses, build confidence and chart our career paths. They are invaluable help and support throughout our careers. Unfortunately, such individualised career services are either availed to the high potential segments of a company, only in large organisations and multinational corporations (MNCs), or those who are retrenched or unemployed. In the same vein, there is a lack of industry-led accreditation of career coaches and coaching in Singapore.For our young fresh graduates, mid-careerists in the throes of a mid-life or mid-career crisis and vulnerable segments, such as those who are not so young as well as inmates and ex-offenders – having a career coach to mentor them, to help them navigate the journey of upskilling and retraining with them can make a world of difference. And as we navigate a skills and employment landscape that is increasingly complex, the assistance and guidance by a career coach is becoming more of a necessity than a luxury. Therefore, I propose that there be industry-led accreditation of career coaches and counsellors and expanding SkillsFuture Credit utilisation to include the engaging of professional career coaches and counsellors. The advice and guidance rendered by the career coach would complement what SkillsFuture, in its existing form, already offers. It may even reduce or resolve the psychological barriers to training and ensure all Singaporeans that they have equal chances and opportunities at all stages to develop their skills. Whether they are in the midst of a life transition, or just looking to upskill, Singaporeans can look towards SkillsFuture as providing the full suite of services that would support them in that journey. Toolbox in hand, Singaporeans can be confident that there is a master tradesman by their side to guide them in the effective use of tools to achieve skills mastery.Taking a longer-term view, the SkillsFuture initiative could then be what reduces the skills and jobs mismatch, thereby reducing under-employment and skills shortages. It would maximise our intended structural outcomes in progressing the development of our people and economy, while ensuring that Singaporeans continue to have access to opportunities – regardless of their life stage – to help them find their true north and realise their full potential. On a final note, I have previously lobbied in this House on many occasions in the past decade, the possibility of monetary support for those unemployed to help them tide over the difficult period before finding and landing the next job. The idea has been fleshed out in our joint NTUC-SNEF PME Taskforce report recommendations and again during our recent #EveryWorkermatters conversations. All workers, including PMEs, especially those in their 40s and 50s, are visibly concerned and anxious over skills obsolescence and unemployment. In this respect, I welcome Madam President's mention and Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's speech yesterday which alluded that the Government would study how we will extend support beyond the pandemic – well, similar to the COVID‐19 Recovery Grant and the SGUnited Jobs and Skills programme, to watch our backs and help our workers tide over unemployment and get re-employed again.Madam Deputy Speaker, with that, I support the Motion of Thanks to the President.Mdm Deputy Speaker: Mr Gerald Giam.\",\n",
       " 'Thank you, Mdm Chair. I note that Mr Patrick Tay said that the 10-year through-train-school idea is not new. Ms Denise Phua proposed it more than a decade ago. I have not had the chance to check the Hansard yet. But be that as it may and in the interest of arriving at the best policies for Singaporeans, regardless of who raised it first, do Mr Patrick Tay and Ms Phua agree that the 10-year through-train programme from Primary 1 to Secondary 4 would be a helpful option for parents who want their children to bypass the PSLE?Mdm Deputy Speaker: Mr Patrick Tay.',\n",
       " \"If I may give a quick response to the hon Member Gerald Giam, I think there are constraints, and I think it was highlighted again in my speech. I mentioned about MOE's response to this idea and suggestion by the hon Member Denise Phua. I think there are constraints because you are looking at the whole continuum from primary to secondary school. As of today, the teachers and staff already have very exacting requirements and demands on their time and resources. So, doing this will mean dedicating even more resources, and even stretching workers in this space and the entire education ecosystem. This requires serious consideration and, therefore, it is something we need to think carefully before we move on to the step.Mdm Deputy Speaker: Ms Denise Phua.\",\n",
       " \"Thank you, Madam. In response to hon Member Gerald Giam's question, I still think that there is potential good pathway to do away with the PSLE and have a pilot of an integrated 10-year programme. But I also acknowledge the challenges that Education Minister Chan Chun Seng mentioned in this year's Committee of Supply (COS). So, the debate should not be on just having or not having that pathway, but really to go on to the next level, perhaps in the Forward Singapore conversations.As to what it will take to create a pathway like this, the challenges, and to solve some of the root issues that the ground faces and will be having. So, I think the debate is not just to have or not to have – that is like a 10-year-old debate, whether to have or not to have – but really to go on to the next level. What does it take? Why it should happen or why should it not happen? And what kind of resources? What contraints will come in if we choose that pathway? I do support that potential pathway still.Mdm Deputy Speaker: Ms Janet Ang.\",\n",
       " 'Mdm Deputy Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak on the Motion put up by hon Member of Parliament, Mr Murali Pillai. I join the hon Member to express gratitude to the President for her Address.Mdm President\\'s speech on behalf of the Government was uplifting and covered a lot of ground and I thank her for inspiring all of us to run the next lap as one Singapore amidst an increasingly complex world. We have come a long way since gaining Independence and achieved what many would consider an economic miracle. The Economic Intelligence Unit recently just ranked Singapore for the 15th consecutive year as the world\\'s best business environment over the next five years. Trust in Government, as measured by Edelman, remains consistently high and we should not take that for granted. Our political maturity has also come of age with this Parliament having its first Leader of the Opposition appointed by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.However, all of us need to acknowledge that Singapore is at a point of inflexion. We have a declining birthrate since 2017. And, like many of the advanced economies, we are in the middle of a silver tsunami. To keep our economy vibrant and to support the needs of our ageing population, Singapore needs a large pool of foreign complementary workforce. Hence, the foreign residents today constitute 38% of the labour force and represent 27% of all residents in Singapore. Singaporeans are faced with a dilemma of accepting this reality and creating a welcoming culture of integrating our foreign guest workers into our communities, or, allowing the continued tight labour situation to (a) negatively impact our service quality and the Singapore brand; (b) cause the burnout of our workforce due to their having to double-up for the shortage of labour; and (c) limiting our companies\\' growth opportunities, just to name a few. I would like to call Members\\' attention to a Straits Times article on 13 April with the headline: SBF calls for foreign worker measures to be eased as workload on frontliners piles up.  Singapore is, indeed, at a point of inflexion. It is timely that the whole of Government (WOG) has engaged Singaporeans in the Forward SG exercise led by Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong and the 4G leaders as a start to the refresh of our social compact. I salute the 14,000 Singaporeans from civil society and businesses who have stepped forward to co-create with the Government in re-imagining what success for Singapore 2.0 could look like. I attended a couple of the sessions myself and I can feel the love by so many of our Singaporeans for our country. Most heartening for me to know is that the affirmation that Singaporeans wish to hold intact the core values that we cherish as Singaporeans, that is, fairness, inclusivity, mutual support and the desire to give back to society. In her address, Mdm President spoke about the need for a broader and more open meritocracy that will work well for all Singaporeans. What would this Singapore-style meritocracy look like? Now, Collins Dictionary defines meritocracy as a society or social system in which people get status or rewards because of what they achieve, rather than because of their wealth or social status. Hence, the idea behind meritocracy is that the most talented and hardworking individuals should be given opportunities to succeed, regardless of their background or social class or their gender. Many positive outcomes of meritocracy have been realised: (a) top of the list is social mobility and many amongst us can stand to be counted as beneficiaries; (b) another positive outcome is that meritocracy promotes a more efficient and effective workforce as individuals are rewarded for their achievements and their hard work; and (c) meritocracy is largely seen as a fair system, thus promoting justice and equality. That said, there are also pitfalls to meritocracy. Meritocracy assumes equal access to all opportunities by everyone. And this is not always the case since those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds may not have the same resources or access and that can limit their chances of success. Two, meritocracy can be limited by how we define merit. In Singapore\\'s case, merit has been closely associated with paper qualifications and, hence, the phenomenon of the \"paper chase\". The narrow definition of merit to paper qualifications does not consider other qualities which, in fact, are competencies needed for the 21st century workforce, and these qualities include EQ, creativity, ability to communicate with influence or even craftsmanship and other non-traditional skills. Most of our employers in Singapore recruit, pay, promote and advance their employees based only on paper qualification primarily. Three, meritocracy can also create social division as those who are successful may attribute their success as solely due to their own merit rather than recognising the role of their family, the larger environment and society that has enabled and empowered them to be successful. This individualism mindset will, over time, erode the values of our society.Responding to Mdm President\\'s call to action for a rethink of the approach to education and to work so as to avoid the pitfalls of meritocracy as it is today, I would like to start the dialogue along these two aspects and offer some \"food for thought\" along the way. First, let us re-imagine meritocracy in education and I will raise three themes.First and foremost, we need to go back to basics and remind everyone in the system, embracing the dignity of the child and igniting in every child the joy of learning need to be central in any education system and believed in by all stakeholders – parents, educators/teachers, principals, policy-makers and society.Singapore does a reasonably good job in this regard and our educators deserve a big kudos for all they do for our children. How we were able to keep our children in school throughout most part of COVID-19 with teachers having to pivot to provide hybrid learning, is a case in point. The child is certainly central to our educators in Singapore.Next, I am heartened to see that increasingly so, more attention and resources are being given to children with special needs.For youths whose circumstances are challenged, the Government is enabling more social services agencies to provide the appropriate care from preventive to developmental, to rehabilitative.And community initiatives, like Yellow Ribbon, to give youths who have made bad choices in their lives, a second chance, is to be applauded.And the Government\\'s commitment to KidSTART and other programmes which help to uplift the children in the lower-income households and give them an equal chance early in life to participate on a level playing field is the absolute right thing to do.And for older students who may need extra help but cannot afford tuition, I would like to propose that MOE invest in some kind of after-school \"study halls\" facilitated by teachers and student ambassadors to help these students with their revision, homework and preparation for examinations. These initiatives will go a long way to narrow unequal access to resources and in so doing, facilitate social mobility.Three, the biggest challenge lies in changing mindsets. Meritocracy inevitably drives individual achievements and that is how the individualism mindset gets ingrained. To break the individualism mindset, a few things need to be reset. First, expectations need to be reset for both the teachers, the principals, the school system and the parents from focusing on grades to emphasising the dignity of the child, developing in the child the joy of learning and inculcating in the child the values of fairness, inclusivity, mutual support and the desire to give back to society. I submit to you that the adults need to walk-the-talk and role model the way forward for the students. So, dialogue and alignment amongst the stakeholders would necessarily be the first step. Two, teach our students that \"we are all in this together\". For this, perhaps, we can take a page from the late Nelson Mandela, and I quote, \"In Africa there is a concept known as \\'ubuntu\\' – the profound sense that we are human only through the humanity of others; that if we are to accomplish anything in this world, it will in equal measure be due to the work and achievement of others.\"Ubuntu is the philosophy of \"I am because we are\". As Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said yesterday, let our language be \"more of us and we and less of I and me\".Three, rewards motivate behaviour. The next step is to review the rewards system across the board. How are the teachers evaluated and rewarded? Are the students rewarded based on academic achievements primarily or behaviours of their values in action? How are parents engaged in the process to fulfill the common purpose of educating their child? Are students encouraged to share their knowledge and their skills with classmates who may need help?Rewards motivate behaviour. We cannot ask the educators to deliver one thing, but measure and pay them on something else. Likewise, for the students, how will their behaviours be rewarded, both in terms of the way they are graded as well as the way they will qualify for admission to higher levels of education?And so, I come to the next point. Specifically, admission criteria for students to progress can afford a rethink. How do we reward team spirit and team behaviour and perhaps penalise negative individualistic behaviours when crafting admission criteria? While we do want to develop our students to their best potential and have them be the Edusave Awards for Achievement, Good LEadership and Service (EAGLES) and soar, we ought to take a lesson from nature as even eagles in the sky fly in formation and take turns to be at the head of the \"V\". This formation helps them to fly longer distances. Perhaps, MOE and the schools and the parents might take this lesson on board and rethink the criteria used for rewarding students EAGLES. Five, rethink Government scholarships. I have heard stories of how smart students attain Singapore Government\\'s prestigious scholarships only to break bond and worse still, the intention to do that was already there even at the point of application. The Government might want to rethink the purpose of Government scholarships and perhaps consider giving more scholarships to students who both have merit and financial need. The Public Service Commission (PSC) may also want to review the penalties for persons breaking bond and make them punitive enough, likened to defaulting their National Service (NS) commitments, so as to incentivise the right behaviours and values.Breaking bond is a crime as you rob a fellow Singaporean from the opportunity to access the education and the experience that the scholarship provides.Of course, there may be some scholarships which are in recognition of one\\'s achievements. For such scholarships, perhaps, the Government can consider not imposing a bond but instead other forms of paying it forward.Another recommendation I have is for Government to send their scholars to serve their bond in local small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). This will spread out the talent to our local industry and, at the same time, these smartest of the smartest of Singaporeans will have a better understanding of issues on the ground and be better policy-makers when they return to the Public Service. Six, teachers play a significant role in all of this. The challenge of teachers is time. How can we help teachers by having them do less administrative work so they have more student encounters? How can we help to unburden their stress and keep their mental wellness in glowing condition? A kind word, a thank you, a please, a smile from the students and from parents would mean so much. And I would like to add that teacher-student interactions play a big part in educating the child. As we have falling enrolments due to fewer babies born each year, one proposal that I hope MOE can consider and I heard it in the House just now as well, is to bring down class sizes to less than 30 students per class. This will really help enhance teacher-student interactions. Seven, it takes a village to raise a child. Can the Government consider giving tax rebates to singles, the aunts and the uncles, who sponsor their nieces or nephews for their continuous education or tuition, in the same way like deductions for foreign domestic helpers in the tax form? Let me now transition from education to the workplace. Unlike the past, our students today face constant disruptions. What they have learnt in the first 25 years will need to be constantly upskilled and reskilled to stay relevant to the industry and the workplace. Singapore\\'s SkillsFuture is a brilliant and strategic vision. Its implementation will go a long way toward changing the view of meritocracy earned at point of graduation, to meritocracy earned over a lifetime. So, let us re-imagine meritocracy in the workplace.Just as MOE has developed multiple pathways for success, there should be multiple pathways for success in the industry.Allow me to focus my attention on the 60% of each year\\'s cohort of students who attend the Institute of Education (ITE) and/or polytechnics. The industry has a big part to play to help themselves as this is the pipeline of their workforce. Over the years, the polytechnics and ITE have stepped up engagement with industry and in many instances, imbedded industry into the curriculum. This is very important to ensure that the students are skills-ready and job-ready when they leave the system.Today, almost all students have the opportunities to do internships and attachments with companies as part of their polytechnic/ITE education.I think that more can be done to incentivise companies to hire our polytechnic/ITE students as apprentices, even before graduation, and for the companies\\' on-the-job training to be certified as stackable modules toward the diploma course which the students are pursuing, or even toward professional qualifications later on. MOE\\'s Work-Study Programme has been designed to facilitate such a pathway. Singapore Polytechnic\\'s Industry Now Curriculum has imbedded such elements. Outcomes have been positive. But we need more companies to come on board.This is where I see SGUnited Jobs and Skills which was effectively applied during COVID-19, can pivot to incentivise companies to employ our polytechnic/ITE students as apprentices and progress them to full-time jobs after graduation. The target group should be the polytechnic/ITE students who are unlikely to take the university route right after attaining their diplomas. So, we can be more targeted.Next, pay for skills, pay for value. In Singapore, I said earlier, most employers still hire and pay by qualifications and not by skills and value. I would advocate once again that SGUnited Jobs and Skills may be leveraged to target certain jobs which we want to have more Singaporeans in the roles but whose compensation package is currently not appealing for the Singaporeans to be excited to step in and companies need to be weaned off supposedly cheaper foreign labour. The target jobs ought to be aligned with MTI\\'s Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) so that the support and incentives can be more targeted.MTI\\'s Accelerated Pathways for Technicians and Assistant Engineers grant to support manufacturing companies in training and hiring ITE graduates for critical technical roles is a good case in point. We should replicate that – fast.Next, Government to lead the way. Between the Public Service, the Temasek-linked companies and the Government-linked companies, they hire a sizeable percentage of Singaporean workforce. So, I hope that they can lead the way from all the points that I have mentioned and start now. Many of our SMEs do not have the same access to capital, tools, networks and leadership. How can we incentivise our MNCs and large local enterprises (LLEs) to bring along our SMEs who are the vulnerable community in the business world in their value chain and, in so doing, intervene to avoid the pitfall of meritocracy which SMEs may be disadvantaged? Government procurement, if open to SMEs directly or via the value chain, will certainly help minimise the pitfalls of meritocracy as well. In conclusion, my hope is for our Singapore style of meritocracy to be one which values the dignity of every person, no matter their abilities or achievements, upholds the spirit of community that is as Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong calls it, more about the we and us and less about the I and me, empowers attitudes of always learning and collaborating, embraces a culture of care and dialogue, compassion and giving, inspires each one to strive for excellence together for the common good and creates an economy that is at the service of society where no one is left behind. I am confident that as One Singapore, we can make every tomorrow better than today. Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Motion. Mdm Deputy Speaker: Mr Leong Mun Wai.',\n",
       " 'Mdm Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the Motion thanking the President for her Address.The President\\'s Address points to the urgent need to refresh our social compact. This includes helping Singaporeans with more job support, strengthening the social safety nets, broadening the definition of meritocracy and promoting a strong sense of shared identity where every Singaporean feels that they have a stake in our country. These are noble aspirations which the Progress Singapore Party (PSP) strongly supports. However, to refresh or to redefine our social compact, PSP thinks that we need to first rethink fundamentally some of the more important policies on jobs, public housing, education and work and ultimately, what it means to be Singaporean.PSP has vigorously debated the Government on some of these issues, especially jobs and public housing in the past three years. Ms Hazel Poa and I had demonstrated what PSP, as a responsible Opposition party, will do to allow the voices of Singaporeans be heard.Among many other actions, we have asked more than 300 Parliamentary Questions, tabled two full Motions on jobs and public housing and three Adjournment Motions questioning vaccination-differentiated measures, public expenditures on the Sports Hub and SPH Media Trust and the Selective En Bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3. We have proposed serious alternative policies as a responsible Opposition party does. But regrettably, the Government does not generally seem to be prepared to consider our proposals seriously.The Deputy Prime Minister\\'s message yesterday confirms that one more time.Based on our debates with the Ministers, we believe that the policy changes advanced by the Government are inadequate to address the problems on hand. For example, the job security of Singaporeans and the surging HDB prices.Notwithstanding that, PSP is committed to work with the Government and all political parties as one Singapore team to empower our people, renew our social compact and secure a brighter future for ourselves and our children.From my very first speech as a Non-constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) in this Parliament, I have raised the concerns of Singaporeans who believe that the current socioeconomic policies are not working for them.Many Singaporeans are very concerned that the benefits of job growth and economic growth are mainly accruing to the foreign workforce in Singapore rather than Singaporean workers, even though our workers are well educated, well skilled and hardworking.We raised the widespread anxiety experienced by Singaporeans regarding their jobs and livelihoods during the debate on our foreign talent policy in September 2021. Regrettably, during that debate, instead of answering our questions directly and allowing the debate to focus on the more substantial issues, the Government tried to paint the PSP as a xenophobic, nativist and even racist political party. We categorically reject such allegations.The PSP has always maintained that for Singapore to achieve greater economic success, we will always need the right foreign talent to complement a Singaporean Core. We welcome the right foreign talent. However, when the quality, number and concentration of Work Pass holders affect the job security of Singaporeans, we must speak out. Singapore is a global city state. Unlike the Americans in New York or the Chinese in Shanghai, our countrymen have nowhere else to go if they cannot afford the cost of living or are displaced from their professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMET) jobs. There is no hinterland for these Singaporeans to retreat to. They will have to leave Singapore and go to another country. We must treasure our citizens and cannot let this happen.That is why over the last three years, I have continued to ask so many questions and focused so many of my speeches on our foreign manpower policy, the wage and employment situation of Singaporeans and workplace discrimination.Some of the specific policies that we have proposed in the last session of this Parliament include an Employment Pass (EP) levy of $1,200 per month, increasing the qualifying salaries for EP and Special Pass (SP) holders in stages over three years to $10,000 and $4,500 respectively; and to implement diversity quotas that limit the total percentage of a company\\'s workforce from any given nationality.These are rational and constructive policy alternatives to level the playing field for Singaporeans. They are not meant to close our doors to foreign talents or target any nationality or race.We have merely sought to advance the interest of our Singaporean workers and to give voice to their persistent anxieties and concerns over our immigration policy and their livelihoods. It is dangerous for the Government to misconstrue our concerns as being motivated by nativism, xenophobia and racism.In this session of Parliament, let us live up to the President\\'s exhortation last week – for us to have constructive, respectful and responsible political debates that are based on facts and sound analysis. At the end of the day, we are all doing our best for Singaporeans. And a Parliament that is a fair arena for all parties is one that will earn further respect from its people.In the last session of Parliament, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has introduced many policy initiatives under the leadership of Minister Dr Tan See Leng such as the new workplace fairness legislation, the Complementarity Assessment Framework (COMPASS) and an increase in minimum EP qualifying salaries. However, the many exemptions granted undermine the effectiveness of these policies as the MOM is given a large discretion on how to enforce these policies.To be effective in restoring the balance in our local job market and levelling the playing field for Singaporeans, the PSP thinks that we need policies with hard targets, like the ones PSP has proposed.We hope that the Government will continue to strengthen support for unemployed and under-employed workers and raise the wages of low-income Singaporeans at a faster rate. The PSP has proposed a minimum living wage to do this. We also look forward to contributing to the debate on the new workplace fairness law next year.We have also pushed for improvement of the financial security of Singaporeans, which is most affected by the affordability and accessibility of public housing. We had a substantive debate on this issue for some 12 hours in February, initiated by Hazel Poa and me.The public housing debate is yet another example that shows the value of having Opposition Members in this House. We have reflected an issue that many Singaporeans are deeply concerned about, advanced Singaporeans\\' interest and aired their doubts on the Government\\'s narrative about affordable housing in Singapore.Despite our very limited resources, the PSP has put up two key policy proposals to reset our housing policy – the Affordable Home Scheme and the Millennial Apartment Scheme. We have researched and thought through these policies before raising them in this House. They are rational alternatives that we believe will better achieve our desired outcomes of affordable housing and family formation, while delinking retirement adequacy from housing prices.I welcome the Government to provide statistics to substantiate their rhetoric that our alternative policies will cause a crash in the housing market.During this session of the 14th Parliament, we will continue to scrutinise the Government\\'s housing policies and keep a check on the Government\\'s move to stabilise prices in the housing market.In particular, Singaporeans are anxious to know what solutions the Government has to resolve the lease decay problem. For a Government which prides itself on efficiency and not shying away from politically difficult decisions, it is hard to understand why the Government has not announced further details for the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS) or other solutions for the lease decay problem in the past five years.We will continue to ask the questions that Singaporeans want to ask but may not be asked by Members of the ruling party. That is our duty as a responsible and rational Opposition party.We will also continue to put up alternative housing policies that we believe will be in the interest of all Singaporeans.As always, we expect these policies will be robustly challenged by the Government, but we hope that these policies will not simply be brushed off as raiding the reserves or crashing the housing market – just because they do not fit into the Government\\'s framework for the reserves of finances, or challenge the Government\\'s \"sacred cow\" policies like homeownership.I hope that the Government can refrain from such posturing so that we can have a more productive debate in this House. Like I mentioned earlier – a fair arena for one and all.During her address in 2020, the President said as masters of our own land, Singaporeans must have confidence in their rights and privileges of citizenship. Last week, the President spoke about deepening Singaporeans\\' sense of shared identity. These two issues are interlinked.All Singaporean should identify with the notion that we are masters of our own land and our shared identity should be grounded in the rights and privileges of citizenship.PSP welcomes foreigners to complement the Singaporean Core, but first and foremost, the PSP will do all it can to protect the position of Singaporeans as masters of our own land. PSP understands and empathises with many Singaporeans who feel like they are second-class citizens in Singapore today.Life is tough for many. Singaporeans feel like they are draining their resources just to stay afloat instead of being empowered to swim towards a better life. Naturally, they feel resentment when they see an influx of wealthy new immigrants setting up family offices and driving up property and COE prices.During my walkabouts, many Singaporeans have expressed to me that they are aggrieved that many naturalised Singaporean Citizens who arrived in Singapore comparatively recently enjoy most of the benefits of citizenship and can gain from the resources that past generations of Singaporeans have accumulated without having to serve National Service or even volunteer service in the SAF Volunteer Corps.Eighteen year-old Singaporeans make immense contributions to us being masters of our own land by serving National Service. To recognise this, the Progress Singapore Party has supported lowering the voting age to 18 since our party was founded and I repeat this call today. This is also the stance of the Workers\\' Party and Ms Sylvia Lim just reiterated that in her speech today.In addition, we must do more to prioritise Singaporeans and redistribute economic gains so that these perceptions can be corrected and we can empower those Singaporeans who feel like second-class citizens today.While we support an open economy, with the free movement of labour and capital, such movement must be carefully controlled and calibrated. In the labour market, the interests of Singaporeans must be prioritised. In the housing market, we must ensure that public housing remains affordable and accessible and that rising land prices due to an influx of wealthy foreigners who are allowed to purchase private property to not cascade down into the HDB resale market. PSP will continue to fight for all these during this session of Parliament. Mdm Deputy Speaker, the urgent need for a refresh of our social compact means that we must rethink and may even have to discard many of the old policies, in order to bring Singapore to greater heights.PSP believes that we need to have a new set of alternative policies that will serve us better going forward. In the last session of this Parliament, we have proposed some of those alternative policies for providing good jobs and affordable public housing to Singaporeans. As members of a responsible Opposition party, Hazel Poa and I will continue to propose more alternative policies for the rest of our term as NCMPs. We hope the Government will notice our serious alternative proposals this time. Singaporeans deserve better. For country, for people.Mdm Deputy Speaker: Dr Wan Rizal.',\n",
       " 'Mdm Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the Motion. Meritocracy is a core value that has been instrumental to our nation’s success. It is the principle that individuals should be rewarded based on their abilities and achievements, regardless of their background. It has driven Singapore’s economic growth and helped create a prosperous, inclusive and diverse society.However, we must also recognise that meritocracy is not a perfect system and I am glad Mdm President touched on this. It is important to acknowledge the role that socioeconomic factors and perceived structural inequalities can play in limiting opportunities for certain groups.To address these challenges, we must continue to promote our brand of meritocracy that ensures everyone has the tools they need to succeed and one that has a broad definition of success. And this is where education plays a crucial role, in not only being a vehicle of social mobility but providing multiple platforms for individuals with different interests and passion to develop. This, in turn, will foster equal opportunities for all.Madam, education is the cornerstone of our society, shaping the hearts and minds of future generations. In our pursuit of meritocracy, we must continually invest in early childhood education to provide a strong foundation for our children.Early childhood is a critical period in which cognitive, social, and emotional skills develop rapidly. By nurturing these skills from a young age, we can ensure that every child has an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of background or circumstances.  In the fervent words of my maiden speech, I implored that we enshrine early childhood education as a fundamental right, a conviction I hold steadfastly to this day.  For me, this transcends the mere number of children attending school; it represents a profound transformation in our collective consciousness, a shift that underscores the indispensable value of making education not just accessible but unequivocally compulsory. The Government has made significant strides in improving early childhood education. Therefore, I welcome the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF)’s addendum outlining plans to strengthen preschool education and ensure affordable and accessible quality childcare.The KidSTART programme, for example, has successfully provided early childhood development support for children from low-income families, helping to level the playing field and give these children a better chance at success. Madam, in addition to early childhood development, we must ensure that our education system provides multiple opportunities for success. MOE has championed this cause by offering diverse educational opportunities to cater to our student’s unique strengths and interests.Over the years, I have had students from various educational backgrounds in the polytechnic. Some came from the ITE, others through the Poly Foundation Programme – they are actually \"N\" level students – and some were \"A\" level students who decided to switch. Regardless of their background, I have seen them doing very well when pursuing their Diploma in the Polytechnic, partly due to them pursuing their field of interest. Some continue to pursue their degrees afterwards, while others are in a job where their interests match.As an educator, all I want is for my students to develop at their own pace and fulfil their passion and potential; and I have yet to be disappointed. This is a testament to our education system, which has evolved over the years to accommodate diverse interests and learning styles, foster creativity and promote critical thinking. Madam, as an educator for over 20 years, I have been fortunate to witness first-hand the transformative power of education and its impact on the lives of our fellow Singaporeans.  One of my former students, Ibrahim, switched from the A-level route to do a diploma. He came from a humble background and faced some challenges in his educational journey. Nevertheless, he persevered and completed his diploma. What stood out was that he was positive, he was hard-working and was a natural leader – traits that go beyond grades. After a few years, he secured a place in university and landed a fulfilling job in his field of choice.Ibrahim’s story is a testament to the power of education and the opportunities it can provide. In this rapidly evolving world, our education system must adapt and innovate to foster well-rounded individuals who can thrive in diverse environments.  Ultimately, we, as a society, must recognise that success is not just about grades but also about developing character, values and life skills. By shifting our focus to this holistic approach, we can empower our youths to become resilient, adaptable and compassionate leaders of tomorrow. Madam, next, I would like to address an issue I have been pursuing throughout my stint in Parliament – which is mental health.Our society has made great strides in recent years, recognising mental health as a critical aspect of our overall well-being. We have seen public awareness campaigns challenging stigma and, most importantly, more people stepping forward to seek help. However, our work is far from over. We must continue our efforts to destigmatise mental health, recognising that it is as important as our physical health. We have a collective responsibility to create an environment where everyone can access the support they need without fear of judgement or discrimination.  The Government has recently invested in various initiatives to promote mental health. The efforts by the Inter-agency Taskforce on Mental Health and Well-being and expanding mental health services in polyclinics are commendable examples.  As we forge ahead, I would like to suggest a few areas for consideration.Firstly, we must increase access and reduce costs as well as waiting time for mental health services. We can achieve this by enhancing the affordability and availability of mental health services through Government subsidies and expanding such services in the heartlands. Additionally, The Mental Well-being Circles must be adequately and rigorously trained and deployed to provide that much-needed first tier of support in the community.Secondly, let us continue to invest in preventive measures focusing on early intervention. By providing mental health education in schools and the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) and equipping dedicated staff with the necessary skills and resources, we can identify and support students at risk of developing mental health issues. Lastly, we must continue to fund and increase funding for mental health research. Research not only helps us identify factors contributing to mental health issues, but also informs the creation of effective prevention and intervention strategies. Additionally, research findings can guide the improvement of mental health services and the development of policies and programs tailored to individuals’ needs. As we strive to create a brighter future for Singapore, let us remember that mental health is not an issue that can be resolved overnight. We are better together. And it requires continuous effort and dedication from all of us, working hand-in-hand with the Government, healthcare professionals, educators and community partners. Madam, let me share a story that has left an indelible mark on my heart. I once had a student named Sarah, not her real name, who struggled with severe anxiety. Through early intervention, dedicated support from her teachers and her family’s unwavering love, Sarah overcame her challenges. Today, she is a thriving young woman, passionate about advocating for mental health awareness. Her story is a testament to the transformative power of understanding, empathy and timely intervention. It is a reminder that together, we can create a society where everyone has the opportunity to flourish, regardless of the challenges they may face. As we work towards this goal, let us channel our collective passion, energy and commitment to ensure that mental health remains a priority on our national agenda. Sir, in Malay, please.(In Malay): The HealthierSG initiative is testament to the Government\\'s unwavering commitment to the health of all Singaporeans. Through Healthier SG, the Government will enhance preventive care and empower citizens to manage their own health and undergo regular screening.Recently, Minister Masagos, in his speech at the M3 Healthy Investment Family Festival, underlined the importance of addressing health challenges directly and investing in preventive measures for a healthier future. I fully believe that the HealthierSG initiative will improve our community’s well-being significantly. I had previously shared my efforts to achieve a healthier lifestyle.  Last year, although I did not \"appear\" fat, but through health screenings, I was told that based on the Body Mass Index (BMI), I was overweight and I needed to make a major change in lifestyle. I am grateful that I managed to lose 15 kilogrammes and managed to maintain the same weight since then.  By encouraging regular health screenings, we can detect health problems earlier and prevent their condition from becoming chronic.Apart from health screenings, the HealthierSG initiative can improve our community’s well-being by promoting a healthier diet, exercise, and mental wellness.  I urge community leaders to work closely with grassroots organisations and residents to develop a health programme that suit the unique needs of their respective communities. One example is the initiative by M3@Jalan Besar. At the end of the month, a pilot training programme for coaches lasting 6 weeks will be launched to build a network of like-minded community leaders to promote and manage healthy living activities. We aim to equip them with basic knowledge about healthier lifestyle programs and ways to plan programs that are suitable for the demographics of their respective towns. They will also be trained to manage the Healthy Investment programme with the support of HPB as part of the new Focus Area 5 (or FA5) area within M3.Madam, health is our personal responsibility. We are obligated to take care of our health so that we can prevent chronic diseases and lead a healthier life. When we are healthy, we will be able to better support our families and communities.(In English): Madam, in conclusion, let us be the voice for those who may be struggling in silence and let us be the agents of change that drive our nation towards a brighter and more inclusive future, a nation where mental health and well-being is valued and supported.As we move forward, let us remember that progress and success are not just about achieving individual goals. Instead, we must work towards building an inclusive and compassionate society where every Singaporean, regardless of their background, has the opportunity to realise their dreams and contribute collectively to our nation’s success and progress. So, let us stand together, united in our commitment to this refreshed meritocracy. Let us continue to innovate, collaborate and co-create a brighter future for our children and future generations. In the words of our founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew, “A nation is great not by its size alone. It is the will, the cohesion, the stamina, the discipline of its people and the quality of their leaders which ensure it an honourable place in history.”Let us honour his legacy by striving for a better, more inclusive, compassionate and resilient Singapore. Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Motion.Mdm Deputy Speaker: Minister Masagos.',\n",
       " 'Mdm Deputy Speaker, across the world, social mobility has been a challenging issue. Many advanced societies have faced wage stagnation. Some youths in other countries do not believe that they will be better off than their parents. In addition, many wonder if they can achieve their aspirations, or they will be kept in the social class they were born into.In countries where this hope has disappeared, the \"have-nots\" tussle with the \"haves\", there is a loss of unity, and society is fractured, weakened. And when the absence of upward mobility is overlaid with racial or religious fault lines, the social fabric frays quickly. We must not let this fate befall us.In Singapore, we have kept social mobility alive across generations. This remains our promise. We want to build a country where there will always be opportunities for families to better their circumstances, and where their children have hope of a better and brighter future. Let me share key features of our society and what we need to do to sustain social mobility.First, Government policies as enablers. Governments must always prioritise, invest in and preserve the social foundations of societies to provide a fair chance for everyone to move up in society. They must address the under-provision of at least three public goods: education, healthcare and housing.Society must accept policies that even out disparities to help address disadvantages families may face.Over decades, we have built a strong foundation in Singapore. We provide families with access to affordable education, housing and healthcare, enabling Singaporeans to pursue their aspirations and realise their potential – the story of Ibrahim cited by Dr Wan Rizal just now, is just one of many stories of Singaporeans that succeeded because of their education; and Sarah, for access to good health systems. Coupled with Government efforts to make Singapore attractive for investments, we enjoy economic growth and create good jobs for Singaporeans. Together, these have helped to uplift generations of Singaporeans.These fundamentals continue to undergird our strategy today. We continue to make significant investments into public education, affordable housing and quality healthcare. It is why Singaporeans continue to sit shoulder to shoulder – and all can access quality healthcare at our public hospitals and their children attend school together. Sustaining these policies across generations is no easy feat. But we have managed to maintain the provision and quality of these goods on an even keel, without ballooning social expenditures that, ultimately, the taxpaying public has to pay for.Second, a strong sense of personal agency and industrious work ethic. For countries to be successful, its people must be earnest in pursuing their aspirations and work hard to earn their success. From the day Singapore was independent, we understood that no one owes us a living. We had to work hard to get where we are today. This ethos is deeply embedded in our psyche. Singaporeans know this and respect those who have earned their success, and similarly, want to work hard to do well for themselves, their families and communities. It is this spirit that will propel this country forward amidst headwinds.Third, those who have done well giving back to society. We have seen this in Singapore\\'s early years where philanthropists and businesses raised funds and set up hospitals and schools. The community contributed to those in need among them. As our country prospered, we saw more individuals and companies giving back to society and uplifting others.We must keep this spirit of giving back alive. Giving back to society is a key ingredient of our country\\'s success, where those who have done well acknowledge the role society has played in enabling the person to succeed and find ways to benefit others, and help others succeed too. As I said five years ago, this is how meritocracy can be moral: when the successful demonstrate a sense of duty to society, when they share the fruits of success with others.And importantly, we all must work together for the common good. We must never underestimate the power of working together. When different entities can come together and work in sync towards a common goal, we can achieve a great deal. It is this quality – of private, people and public sectors working together – that helped us pull through during the pandemic and remain united. Not pulling in different directions and, ultimately, undermining society itself.Mdm Deputy Speaker, we must harness these qualities and work together to tackle the issue of social mobility and to uplift those in need in our society. The Government will strengthen our policies to uplift lower-income families.First, we will give all children a good start in life. We are convinced by evidence that investments in the early years build a strong foundation in our children\\'s lives. This is why we have invested significantly in affordable and quality preschools. We are also providing more intensive support to support mother and child early on in life, through KidSTART. We do not wait for families to come forward. Instead, we reach out to parents as early as during the mother\\'s pregnancy and work with a team of healthcare and social service professionals, volunteers and community partners, to support these children to give them strong chances early in life. This prevents disparities in the early years from snowballing into greater disparities down the road. Since we started KidSTART in 2016, over 6,000 children have benefited.We will intensify our efforts to start children from lower-income families on the right path. We will scale up KidSTART nationwide by 2026 and continue to facilitate priority enrolment for children from lower-income families in Anchor Operator Preschools and MOE Kindergartens.Investing in the early years is not just good science, it is also fiscally prudent. It gives us the best chance of setting children up for success and is more effective than tackling issues downstream.Second, we will provide more support to families. Over the years, this Government has strengthened social safety nets. We have provided transfers and subsidies and targeted assistance to those who need them most. We have designed schemes to keep people in employment and ensure wage growth.But we can do more. We will be proactive, because we know we need to identify issues early before they snowball into larger issues. So, that one thing does not lead to another: a health issue does not become an unemployment issue of another family member, which in turn affects their children\\'s education. We will also ensure that lower-income families get the help that they need quickly and easily. Ultimately, we want families to achieve stability, self-reliance and social mobility – the three \"S\"es.To do so, we will ensure our services are family-centric and easily accessible. This is what ComLink sets out to achieve, by providing wraparound support for families with children living in rental flats. ComLink is another programme that does not wait for families to come forward to get help. A befriender proactively reaches out to families to understand their various needs and aspirations, and works with them to develop goals and action plans. Government agencies and community partners stand behind the befriender and work on the back end to coordinate suitable services and programmes for the families.From four pilot towns in 2019, we have expanded ComLink island wide to 21 ComLink communities, each supported by a Social Service Office. We are further integrating social programmes under ComLink, such as KidSTART, UPLIFT Community Network and Project Dian@M3, so that families receive support from a single touchpoint.To make it easier for families to receive the support they need, we introduced scheme bundles so that lower-income families on ComCare assistance can access other assistances easily. As data is shared on the back end, families can receive assistance without submitting the same information to different agencies.We will ensure that our social services are comprehensive, convenient and coordinated, so that families can get the help they need quickly and easily.Third, we will reinforce and support the personal agency of families who wish to improve their circumstances. Many families want to secure a better future for their family and are taking active steps to uplift themselves and their children. During our Forward Singapore engagements, some have suggested that we should find ways to encourage families who take positive steps, such as securing stable employment and ensuring that their children attend preschool, but to do so in a manner that does not erode their sense of self-reliance and personal agency.When such families put in the effort, we know they are on the road to making progress in their lives. And as part of our social compact, it is good and right that we recognise such efforts. So, we are studying how to do this in a bigger way, under ComLink.Fourth, we want more social service partners across society to uplift communities across Singapore. Uplifting those in need goes beyond social services agencies. It involves businesses, community partners, neighbours and volunteers. It involves all of us. We need partners to share their resources and know-how and distribute their social capital to uplift those who have less.We want to harness the best of organisations to address the needs of communities in innovative ways. This means leveraging organisations\\' assets, expertise and networks to enhance opportunities for lower-income families. For instance, organisations can run mentorship programmes in their workplaces, widening the horizons of youths from less privileged backgrounds and inspiring them to work towards a brighter future.Businesses have an important role to play. It is timely then that many businesses are moving beyond traditional corporate service responsibility (CSR), to weaving social impact into their very core. They know that their success is tied to the success of Singapore. Recognising their responsibility to the wider community, they are reshaping their businesses. Businesses know they are a better and more attractive company when they put equal emphasis on Environment, Social and Governance (ESG). They fulfil their social responsibilities from how they look after their employees, hire inclusively, to how they harness their businesses to make a positive impact on the community.We need businesses to lead the charge and role model the ways in which they uplift communities. We will guide businesses in better measuring and expanding their social impact. We will celebrate and recognise businesses and other partners in this Year of Celebrating Social Service Partners.We recognise that philanthropists, foundations and other entities, like family offices, also want to do good. We have extended our tax deduction rate of 250% for donations until end-2026. The Government will also do more to help private capital and family offices maximise their philanthropic impact.In our efforts, we must also tap on the best minds and translate the best research into practice to make a tangible impact. I am glad that many academics, researchers and institutes of higher learning (IHLs) have taken a keen interest in and are actively working to strengthen and support our families, from evaluating programmes that seek to ensure every child gets a good start in life, to examining ways we can enhance family resilience, so that our families can bounce back after setbacks. We must tap on the wealth of knowledge and expertise at these IHLs to better and more effectively uplift our communities.For example, drawing on its know-how in early childhood education and social work, the Singapore University of Social Sciences worked with ECDA to launch a training programme to equip KidSTART practitioners with the knowledge and skills to better support the development of children from lower-income families. We will strengthen our collaboration with academics and IHLs to improve policies, social work practices and the delivery of services to meet evolving social needs in Singapore.In my speech at the President\\'s Address debate in 2018, I called for a Singapore brand of meritocracy. Today, I call on our IHLs, academics and researchers to conduct original research and build up a robust body of knowledge of social science that applies to our context, one that is made for Singapore.Mdm Deputy Speaker, no Government can sustain social mobility by its efforts alone. Everyone has a role to play in supporting those in need. As part of our refreshed social compact, we must find ways to benefit others and help others succeed and do well together. Individuals, families and our society will be better for it. This is how an inclusive and caring society is built, by the hands of its people.We will achieve much more when we work together than going in alone. To better support families, we must join hands across society: businesses, social service agencies, community partners, volunteers and the Government working hand-in-glove.Over the past few years, we have expended significant efforts to organise ourselves better to support families, coordinating our collective efforts under ComLink. I recall a family receiving five bags of rice from five different well-meaning social service agencies and corporates, which the family had no need for. Our hope is that, with ComLink, community resources can better harnessed to fulfill real needs.What this could look like is: in each ComLink community, a volunteer befriender works with families to refer them to services, such as career coaches to help them secure a job and nearby preschools and after-school programmes provided by the community to support the education of their children. Companies step in to provide mentorship and internship opportunities to the youth to nurture and grow their aspirations.I have seen a glimpse of what is possible in ComLink@Jurong West, where UOL-Pan Pacific Hotels Group provides opportunities for children from lower-income families to access their facilities and enrichment classes, through NUS students stepping forward as ComLink befrienders to journey with families.Rather than each of us going at it alone and duplicating efforts, let us synergise our various efforts into an effective national movement to better support families in need. Let us cast our nets wider beyond our own sectors and work together in common cause to uplift those in need. Let us work together to keep social mobility alive in Singapore. Mdm Deputy Speaker, in Malay, please.(In Malay): Singapore must continue to be a country where there will be opportunities for families to better their circumstances. A country where they can fulfil their aspirations to secure a brighter future for their children. And where our people believe that our brand of Singaporean meritocracy works. To achieve this, we need a strong partnership across sectors, with each sector doing its part: the Government developing policies that help our people progress; the community harnessing available resources to address its needs; and volunteers bringing their skills and talents to uplift the lives of those around them.The mark of a strong social compact is when successful individuals give back to society. We appreciate the efforts of our Malay/Muslim Organisations (MMO) who have long played important roles in uplifting the community. Many of our Malay/Muslim professionals have also stepped forward to serve and contribute to those in need. For example, Lawyers@M3 brings together lawyers, legal professionals, and individuals with legal backgrounds to conduct talks on legal matters, Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) workshops, and pro bono legal clinics for the community. In their spare time, a group of soldiers also volunteer as mentors at ITE College East through Project Pathfinder, serving as role models for the students they journey with. The Muslim Healthcare Professionals Association (MHPA) also works with M3@Towns to bring health-related programmes and workshops closer to residential areas, to better benefit the community. One of the traits that our community can be proud of is the progress that we made over the years, with the community and Government working together, by putting their minds and hands together to uplift the community. The self-help group MENDAKI has become a model that many parties abroad are keen to learn from. It was formed 40 years ago, at a time when our community leaders were concerned about the educational performance of our Malay children. They were committed to helping Malay children reach their fullest potential and attain success. Today, MENDAKI remains relevant as it uses education as a key driver to uplift the community. MENDAKI successfully mobilised the energies and passion of its many volunteers to drive programmes like the MENDAKI Tuition Scheme and KelasMateMatika, for students across all levels today. These MENDAKI volunteers understood our customs and culture and thus helped to augment the Government\\'s efforts to improve Malay/Muslim educational outcomes in tandem with other communities. Today, 99% of every Malay student cohort completes at least 10 years of education. This is a meaningful achievement, as the 10 years of education provides the foundation to enable them to further their studies at the post-secondary level and enable them to pursue lifelong learning. I am heartened by the progress made by the Malay/Muslim community, which was possible due to the awareness of the importance of education as well as the hard work and close partnership of all parties. Let us continue the efforts to enable our children to achieve their fullest potential.  Today, we must take reference from the latest findings from research and science. The research shows that the early years are crucial to a child\\'s development. Therefore, a key aspect of our strategy to sustain social mobility in Singapore is early childhood development. We must ensure that children are enrolled in preschool by around age 3. We are doubling down on our efforts to support families with young children through Project Dian@M3 and will also facilitate priority enrolment for children from lower income families into Anchor Operator preschools and MOE Kindergartens. Our Dian Ambassadors have started visiting these families fortnightly, working with families to read with their children and support the parents in being involved in the development of their young children. Over the decades, the Malay/Muslim community has made great progress on all fronts. This includes achieving stability, self-reliance and social mobility, while continuously giving back both to the community and to the nation. As we face new challenges and as our society continues to grow and evolve, we will continue to work closely with community leaders, Malay/Muslim Organisations, and our many volunteers. This will bring the community closer together to excel and uplift the lives of the most vulnerable. I am confident that our Malay/Muslim community is well placed to forge ahead towards an even brighter future as a Community of Success.(In English): Mdm Deputy Speaker, let me conclude. We must be a society where Singaporeans will always have opportunities to forge a better life for themselves, regardless of their starting position. We must draw on the strengths of individuals and families, the social capital within our communities and resources from the public, people and private sectors to realise this vision. I know we can because we are Singaporeans.Ahead of the 100th anniversary of Mr Lee Kuan Yew\\'s birthday, let me share a quote which I think is evergreen, though he said it in 1965. He said, \"Ten years from now, it will be better than now. Today, it is immensely better than it was 10 years ago. It is better, even, than last year. And it is ours, provided we have got enough sense to be together and nobody can keep an industrious people to work and fight for its future.\" [Applause.]Mdm Deputy Speaker: Order. I propose to take a break now. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at . Sitting accordingly suspended at 4.12 pm until .Sitting resumed at .[Deputy Speaker (Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo) in the Chair] DEBATE ON PRESIDENT\\'S ADDRESSDebate resumed.Mdm Deputy Speaker: Minister Chan Chun Seng.',\n",
       " \"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I welcome the Government’s commitment to improve social safety nets to help Singaporeans better cope with setbacks in life. One group of Singaporeans which I would like to appeal for more support is families with autistic children, in particular those from the lower-income families.  One in 150 children in Singapore has autism, higher than the global average of one in 160 but lower compared to countries such as the US, Japan, Denmark and Australia, which is one in 60 to 70. Experts think that our high rates is partly due to greater detection from higher awareness and testing, and if data from developed countries like the US is an indication, we may detect more cases in the future. Hence, it is important that the Government expedites the setup of a national infrastructure to provide holistic support for Singaporeans with autism, from diagnosis to end of life.Early intervention is critical. The Ministry of Health (MOH) can or may ramp up public education efforts to increase awareness among parents to diagnose their children as soon as possible if they notice the symptoms. Parents should be reminded to follow up with their children’s developmental milestone checks at polyclinics, clinics or hospitals. Upon diagnosis, these children need to be given sufficient treatment and therapy at the optimal frequency to give them the best chance to develop to their highest potential. This is an essential and the best investment we can make in them, especially during the small window period when they are young, which will yield good progress and benefits over the long term.Parents should also be provided with comprehensive advice by an appointed Government agency on how to navigate our system for the best care and protection for their children. This includes sharing with them the trust services of Special Needs Trust Company (SNTC) supported by MSF and available insurance coverage. I urge the Government to work with the insurers to improve access to insurance coverage for persons with autism. They must not be discriminated against for unrelated risk factors, which is the most common and longstanding complaint.For low-income families, we must ensure that the treatment is affordable to them and provide the appropriate subsidies so that they will be able to keep up with the therapy. Counselling and adequate support should also be provided to the family members who often suffer from caregiver fatigue and burnout as well as depression. We need more activity and care centres for children and adults with autism to engage them and allow family members to work with peace of mind and caregivers to take regular breaks.For lower-income families, the lack of capacity in these centres often mean that someone in the family, often the mother, would not be able to work because she becomes the caregiver. This is a blow to their household income, plunging them into deeper financial difficulty.The new daycare activity programme by the Autism Association (Singapore) making use of community spaces such as public libraries and schools to address the issue of the lack of capacity in daycare activity centres for those over 18 years old is a good start.Autism lies on a spectrum, so while there are those who will be able to work and live independently, there are others are not able to do so. We need to establish care arrangements for them when their ageing parents and families are unable to continue taking care of them, especially the financially disadvantaged ones.As sudden changes to their routines can be distressing for them, advance planning is important. The preparation includes introduction and exposure to facilities, environment settings, volunteers and care professionals as well as financial arrangements and legal documentation.  Next, I would like to appeal for more support and assistance for our SMEs. There are many schemes and grants available, but some business owners have trouble navigating and understanding the processes. They are confused by the red tape and even need external consultants to advise them on what they are eligible for. Unfortunately, the owners and consultants' own interests do not always align, as the consultants' earnings are based on certainty and quantity of their commissions. Accessible, timely and neutral advice from knowledgeable agency staff would make a very big difference.As the President noted in her address, Singapore will face more resource constraints – land, labour and carbon – in the near future. In addition, governments of major economies are providing support to boost their own industrial bases. There will be a greater drive for nationalistic projects. The global business environment will become more difficult for us.  I am heartened that our Government will provide more support to promising companies, including customised financial support for local companies to build sustained R&D and innovation capacity and to go global and grow into Singapore global enterprises. Will the Government consider publicising and sharing more about companies tapping capabilities in the IHLs as well as the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) and engaging on platforms such as the Global Innovation Alliance? This will help to raise awareness, inspire and encourage more Singaporeans to consider entrepreneurship.  Singapore is working hard to attain food resilience and the Government is stepping up investments in food research and development such aquaculture, urban agriculture as well as alternative proteins. This is an appropriate and important sector for our SMEs to participate in. We need to increase local demand so that the cycle of local supply and demand is sustainable.  May I also urge the Government to work with SMEs to improve their access to procurement opportunities? It is important for our domestic capability resilience to nurture and build local expertise in as many sectors as possible.Decarbonisation provides generation-defining business opportunities and our Singaporean companies are well-positioned to lead the way. We need Enterprise Singapore to provide more assistance to SMEs so that they know how to measure emissions as many MNCs have started to request their SMEs suppliers to furnish their carbon emission data. SMEs need to keep down their business costs, of which their vehicles’ Certificates of Entitlement (COEs) constitute a portion, a big portion. Presently, car dealers bid for the COEs regardless of whether there are clients buying cars from them or not. They can keep and hog the COEs for months and trade and sell these COEs to other car dealers. If only individual buyers or companies which need COEs are allowed to bid for them, it may bring down the COE prices of Category C. I hope the Government can consider this suggestion.Finally, I reiterate my appeal to MOM to review the foreign worker work permit quota since a number of SMEs, like the small or medium audit firms, face manpower constraints, especially those in the F&B sector. They are unable to hire enough Singaporean workers to meet their operational needs and are struggling to stay in business, even if they have enough demand and clients. I would like to conclude with my support of the Motion of thanks to the President.Mdm Deputy Speaker: Ms Tin Pei Ling.\",\n",
       " 'Mdm Deputy Speaker, I stand in support of the Motion of thanks. The COVID-19 pandemic was a crisis of our generation but also a test from which Singapore emerged more united and our trust in each other strengthened. But we must not take this for granted.As we reopen the Parliament, it is indeed timely to refresh our focus and renew our commitment to our people and Singapore.Looking ahead, our operating environment is increasingly complex. Pressures in and outside of Singapore continue to mount and these can threaten to tear us apart. Game-changing technologies, rising cost of living, shift in social values and heightened international contestation are some of the key forces pulling us in different directions. And none of these is abating.Therefore, even as we strive for progress and push for excellence, we must ensure that Singapore remains united. Our policies must remove barriers and minimise gaps, our Parliament must focus on building up trust, not tearing down and our society must be more inclusive and compassionate.President Halimah spoke of broadening meritocracy and making sure that it continues to work well for all Singaporeans. I agree. There is no better alternative to meritocracy but we need to temper it so that it is more compassionate and more relevant to today’s context.My take is that for those among us who can and want to excel, we ought not to limit them and should wish them well. For those who want to but cannot because of financial circumstances, then we must intervene more strongly to support and move them along. It is not just about giving equal opportunities but to direct more resources to help the abled but underprivileged.We also need to maintain our egalitarianism. One thing precious about Singapore is that despite our different jobs and roles in the economy, we still see ourselves as Singaporeans of similar standing and similar in other areas too, for example, in our taste for hawker foods. \"Towkays\" and workers can all turn up at the same coffee shop to queue for \"bak chor mee\" or \"roti prata\" and share a table to eat thereafter. There is no expectation that one should be deferential or give way to another. The expectation is that they will be treated all the same.Meritocracy can lead to differences in economic outcomes, but these should not lead to differences in social treatment. Our system must give all our people equal rights and opportunities. All of us must affirm our egalitarianism in both spirit and practice.Allow me to share some specific thoughts.First, on education and skills-based workforce. Yesterday, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong spoke of creating Singapore to become a full-fledged learning society, from cradle to grave. Indeed, we must.Disruptions brought about by technological revolutions have been a constant feature throughout history and the pace is gathering. The Great Reshuffle also means that jobs and skills needed are changing and will continue to change. For instance, according to LinkedIn\\'s \"Future of Skills\", skills needed in the technology, information and media industry in Singapore have changed by 36.8% between 2015 and 2022, just a span of seven years. And specific to this industry, seven out of the 10 top skills are considered new. These new skills include new programming languages but also softer skills such as stakeholder management and strategic partnerships.Clearly, we cannot expect to learn the universe in school, but we can acquire the basics from which we continue to build.Our education should focus on inculcating a sense of curiosity in our young, so that they will always be intrinsically motivated to seek out new knowledge and skills.Over the years, changes have been made to the system, but we could do more to foster a culture of curiosity. For example, could we focus less on standard answers but more on imagination and creative solutioning? Indeed, our education system has done away from PSLE T-score and replaced streaming with banding, these are encouraging moves.But what about students who are inventors and storytellers or who have topics of interest not found in the textbooks? How can we recognise and reward them more formally? Can there be an \"independent study\" subject that allows the student to choose a topic of interest to deep dive into and be given a grade that is just as important as an English or math subject, so that we move towards learning that is more versatile, more blue-skies thinking and hopefully, less need for tuition, which is often cited as a costly endeavour that widens the gap?As pointed out, learning does not stop after graduating from the mainstream education system. In future, as industries continue to be disrupted by new technologies, we can expect to change tracks many times in our working lives. Mature workers starting afresh in radically new industries several times, within a lifetime, will become a norm and it would no longer be something to feel embarrassed about.To support this, adult learning should then focus less on long, structured courses with expensive certificates, but shorter and more targeted ones to build practical skills that can be readily deployed at work. Would the Government expand the SkillsFuture credits to enable this? And could we recognise these credentials by recording them as part of our national digital identity, creating a personal digital resume for each Singaporean? The Public Service can perhaps take the lead in formally recognising these short courses taken by officers.Second, a mastering technology and not be mastered by technology. A key development driving the next wave of disruption is artificial intelligence (AI). Goldman Sachs estimated that AI can replace 300 million full-time jobs. This prospect sounds scary. But what is scarier is that the stiff competition to lead in the field of AI could mean a willingness to overlook ethical considerations and other consequences.For example, ChatGPT caught the world\\'s attention in recent times. We are all impressed by its almost-human capabilities. But has the company OpenAI really thought through the long-term social implications of ChatGPT before releasing it? Media reports would suggest that it had not. Consider ChaosGPT, which is the autonomous implementation of ChatGPT that is touted as \"empowering GPT with Internet and Memory to Destroy Humanity\". While ChaosGPT has yet to work out how to really destroy mankind, but by its autonomous nature, it will keep going until it achieves the goal it is given. And with each iteration of technological advancement, one can be sure that ChaosGPT will also get better. Surely, OpenAI could not have invented ChatGPT to destroy ourselves. Even if there was a tinge of hesitation back then, it is now too late to pull back, because the launch of ChatGPT triggered a frenzy amongst tech giants like Google and Baidu rushing to release their own versions of generative AI. When technology confers power, an arm\\'s race begins. Some questions arising from this are: while people are still struggling, in trying their best to keep up digitally, would we have inadvertently moved the goal post so much that we widened the gap between the digital know and know-nots? And between those who have access to powerful technology, and those who have not. What happens if enterprises increasingly feel that \"it\\'s okay\" to ignore ethics, to be irresponsible and just do whatever to make money? What happens if fakes get proliferated and it becomes too difficult to discern what is real and what is not?Given enough time, nothing is impossible with technology. But we as humans, must collectively exercise the will to draw a line in the sand and be clear about what technology must never replace or do. In this case, Governments around the world have a duty to draw that line, coordinate legislation and enforce it. We must embrace technology to better lives, but we must master it and not be mastered by it.Third, on foreign investments and talents in Singapore – value-adding beyond the money. We should continue to welcome high quality and committed foreign talents and enterprises to Singapore, to supplement our Singaporean Core.The Global Investor Programme has been one way of welcoming investments to Singapore, bringing along invaluable industrial capabilities and availing job opportunities to Singaporeans.But we want them to do more than just putting money here. We should make it an explicit requirement for them to contribute socially and to integrate more. For example, require the GIP applicants and Tech Pass holders to commit to: (a) delivering lectures to tertiary students or civil servants every year to enhance frontier industry knowledge; (b) mentoring local start-ups; and (c) adopting a community or charitable programme.By explicitly requiring them to take part in these activities, we create opportunities for meaningful interactions and thereby, breaking down pre-conceived opinions and promote better mutual understanding. Having chosen Singapore as a destination, I am sure these distinguished business leaders will be happy to support good causes here.Fourth, on meaningful ageing so that every day is worth looking forward to. Over the years, Singapore has done tremendous work to create the conditions for our seniors to age in place. Looking ahead, we must continue to pay special attention to our seniors. As family sizes shrink, we can expect more seniors living alone for longer. Hence, we must work to keep them socialised and keep them healthy, even as we continue to emphasise family values and prioritising family support. Our policies and programmes will also have to be designed with future seniors in mind.In my opinion, learning is a great way to stimulate minds and build confidence. In embracing lifelong learning, we could introduce scholarships for seniors to pursue tertiary diplomas or degrees, and celebrate these mature graduands, so that the scholarships are not just limited to youths or young people, but to our mature Singaporeans as well. Is it not exhilarating to defy age stereotypes and know that \"I still got it\"?In essence, seniors should not be \"waiting to die\". This would reflect a certain grief over losing mental and physical capacities. We must work hard to deliver a different, better future for our seniors. Ageing need not be a countdown to life. Entering the silver years can be a new beginning, where there is life, people, new dreams and new adventures worth looking forward to every day.Madam, often when we debate about income gaps and the way forward for Singapore, questions on whether economic growth should be a priority will inevitably arise. I believe that we should not be obsessed with economic competition or figures, but we must also not despise growth and progress. Because of our economic achievements, even the most vulnerable member in our society can access world class education and healthcare, supported by bursaries and the 3Ms – namely MediSave, MediShield LIFE and MediFund. And because we have a strong reserve, we have the fiscal capability to surmount the pandemic and the quiet confidence to face the unknown.Hence, we must excel in whatever we do, but for those who have moved further ahead, remember to look out for and help others who are still struggling. This is the more tempered and more compassionate meritocracy that we desire. We should aim for everyone to be one mass, not stretched thin and far apart and move ahead together. I think this is more powerful as an engine for Singapore.Finally, we as Parliamentarians, have an important duty and role to play in building a united Singapore. We are the voice of Singaporeans. During debates, we must allow diversity of voices so that issues can be considered comprehensively. But we must do so with the aim of illuminating the facts, explaining the trade-offs and bringing everyone to a common ground, not to drive wedges, and deepen social fissures that will fracture our nation.We only have one Singapore. What we have today was painstakingly built over a whole lifetime and more. But to destroy this, could be as short as within just one day. We must not take this for granted. And therefore, I hope as we reopen the Parliament, as we continue to chart the way forward for Singapore, we will continue to do so with Singapore in mind and to build a stronger nation for generations to come. [Applause.]Mdm Deputy Speaker: Dr Shahira Abdullah.',\n",
       " 'Mdm Deputy Speaker, thank you for allowing me to respond to the President\\'s Address.In February, news broke that Anglo-Chinese School (Primary), or ACS Primary, would relocate to Tengah in 2030. It garnered significant attention from the media and public, the alumni and parents. Some applauded the move saying that it would bring about a more diverse student population, which is a view I wholeheartedly agree with.You see, I am of an age in which many of my friends and colleagues are planning for the primary school admission of their children. Many of them come from very humble backgrounds, working hard to get to where they are today. They were able to do so due to our strong emphasis in meritocracy and it speaks towards the success of our education system. For those with a more comfortable financial situation, these parents will naturally seek to pass on these advantages to their children.However, the quest to do so has turned the provision of education and learning into something akin to a competitive arms race. My child is just shy of one year old. Nonetheless, I too feel the pressure when my peers talk about selecting preschools, whether to choose Mindchamps or Odyssey vs the preschool right under the block. Or what kind of enrichment classes should they send their child to, from Heguru to Kumon, speech and drama classes, art class, swimming class or coding class?I hear of and know several parents who have moved to a location near a primary school of their choice, often paying a premium to do so. Some have resorted to renting houses near these schools. All very real things that parents have done to provide what is best for their children. But what about those who are not able to afford these opportunities? When pursuing the ideals of meritocracy, not everybody starts on a level playing field. Will they get left further and further behind?This ties in with the first key priority in Mdm President\\'s Address, which is how the Government will expand opportunities throughout life for all, regardless of individual backgrounds and circumstances. Mdm President\\'s concern was on how we \"must not allow advantages and privileges to become entrenched and persist over generations\".This is something I feel most strongly about. And this is what I will focus my speech on.In theory, a meritocratic society means that a person earns their success through their talent and hard work. Aspirational but in some ways also an illusion. As illustrated, a child with a more privileged family background and financial situation may be scaffolded in ways that may allow them to achieve success more easily. Education may be a social leveller but access to education may not be equal.We must do our best to ensure that all children have equal access to quality education in Singapore. We have taken many bold steps in this, from removing PSLE T-scores to introducing full subject-based banding. We have also introduced an expanded KidSTART which seeks to provide a strong foundation for children from low-income households in Singapore by aiding their parents and caregivers in early childhood development. However, I would like to touch on the intense competition among parents to gain a Primary 1 place for their child. The Primary 1 registration system essentially aims to address many different goals and does strive to ensure diversity in the student cohort. My concern though, is that for certain more popular schools, more privileged families may have more advantage for the different phases. For example, a family may move to a location to have an edge in terms of proximity. Parents working to make ends meet may also be unlikely to be able to spare the amount of time needed to fulfil the volunteering hours needed to qualify for Phase 2B. Alumni places in prestigious schools in affluent neighbourhoods may also contribute to the risk that certain schools may become more exclusive with a more homogenous, higher socioeconomic status (SES) student population.This is why I believe ACS\\' move to Tengah is a forward-looking one. The move appears to have struck a chord among its alumni and has raised uncomfortable discussions on what we have to do as a society to achieve inclusivity and diversity. But I think it is a step in the right direction. Can I dare hope that this move also emboldens the boards of other popular primary schools, particularly those in certain affluent neighbourhoods, to do the same?Secondly, we need to promote a diverse range of pathways to success, valuing not just careers of knowledge and intelligence, but skills and care-based careers as well. These types of careers are equally important. At the height of the pandemic, we saw how the nation depended on the essential workers – our nurses, delivery drivers and cleaners – to carry on, even as the rest of the nation was safely sequestered at home.However, they are often overlooked. Our society tends to value paper qualifications. An ongoing study by Assoc Prof Irene Ng of the National University of Singapore (NUS)\\'s Social Work Department found that those with university degrees earned more than twice those of ITE qualifications and secondary or lower education. It is not enough to speak of an appreciation and respect for the nature of such work. To truly alleviate the dignity of such work or, in the alternative, to make such work viable for the highly capable among us to consider taking up, change must be reflected in the remuneration.Therefore, I am heartened that Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong and Minister Chan reiterated that call in their speeches to make sure that the wages of skilled and care workers will be increased to reflect the mastery of their skills. In doing so, it sends a strong message to Singaporeans that skilled work is important and slowly shifts the social value placed on such work, creating a more inclusive and equitable society. A recent article in The Straits Times had asked: how would you respond if you graduate daughter dated a plumber? Let us hope that with this, the answer will increasingly be \"no problem\".Even in a highly automated world, humans are still able to offer a blend of knowledge, technical and care skills that surpass any present robot we have. As someone who works in the healthcare field, it is plain to see that robots just cannot replace the need for care and empathy from another human.Lastly, achieving a broader, open and compassionate meritocracy in Singapore requires not only policy changes but also a fundamental mindset shift. We must recognise that every individual has something to offer and we must be willing to acknowledge and remunerate them for it. We must send a message to our youths as well, that their value does not lie in academic qualifications alone but in their other strengths as well and that when they have achieved success themselves, they too have a role to build the next generation. Mdm Deputy Speaker, I stand in support of the Motion.Mdm Deputy Speaker: Minister of State Gan Siow Huang.',\n",
       " 'Mdm Deputy Speaker, I thank Members Mr Desmond Choo, Minister of State Desmond Tan and Mr Raj Thomas, Mr Patrick Tay, Ms Jessica Tan, Ms Tin Pei Ling and others who expressed their support for lifelong learning, which is what underpins our national SkillsFuture movement. I also thank their many suggestions on how we can make SkillsFuture more impactful and effective for Singaporeans.Deputy Prime Minister Wong spoke a new approach to skills yesterday, one that requires a fresh commitment to making continuous learning, upskilling, reskilling, a way of life. We will work with industry partners and training providers to offer courses to meet different training needs, encourage employers to support the development of their workers and recognise the skills the workers have acquired and, of course, support individuals to take ownership of their lifelong learning journey.Mr Patrick Tay\\'s analogy of a CET toolbox is an apt one to describe the opportunities but also the challenges that adult learners face. There are three key things that are needed for the toolbox to work well. First, the toolbox must have a wide range of tools to cater to different adult learners with very different training needs. Some require skills top-up for new tasks or roles that their jobs require. For these learners, short courses, like what Ms Tin Pei Ling suggested would suffice.To cater to such learners, the institutes of higher learning (IHLs) are offering modular upgrading. SSG has also launched SkillsFuture series courses that are short courses designed to address skills needs in high growth emerging areas. Last year, 32,000 individuals attended SkillsFuture series courses. Others required more substantive skills reboot by pursuing a full qualification especially if they have left former education a long time ago or they are switching to a new sector or new job role.Next, I agree with Mr Patrick Tay that people need to open the toolbox and know how to use it. With a toolbox of diverse tools, we acknowledge that navigation can be an issue for some. SSG is enhancing the MySkillsFuture portal to improve user experience and provide personalised course recommendation based on individual\\'s careers and skills needs. We also have a team of SkillsFuture Ambassadors on the ground to provide advice to Singaporeans who want to learn more about the courses and programmes available. We will study Mr Patrick Tay\\'s suggestion to allow Singaporeans to use SkillsFuture Credit for career coaching services.Third, I agree that tools must be able to get the job done. This speaks to our efforts to ensure that the courses are relevant to the industry and are of high quality and the employers recognise the skills that their employees have acquired.SSG has reviewed the course fee funding framework to ensure that SSG\\'s highest tier of subsidies are channelled towards courses that deliver the strongest employment outcomes. These changes will be implemented progressively to allow our IHLs and training providers to adjust their offerings.Employers must also play their part to recognise the skills that their workers have acquired through training, place them in appropriate jobs and remunerate them appropriately. To support employers in doing so, SSG is working with the trade associations and chambers (TACs) and professional bodies to recognise skills attained through courses or on-the-job training in selected sectors.Moving to the subject of job security, our labour market move has posted strong growth last year. We are at full employment with long-term unemployment at 0.7%. Our resident employment is higher now than it was pre-pandemic. However, we are mindful of the global economic uncertainties and how this may affect jobs here. At the same time, many businesses, especially SMEs have told us about the acute shortage of labour.The Singapore Business Federation (SBF) has asked us to allow businesses to ease foreign worker measures. Ms Janet Ang just a while ago also said that the shortage of labour here can cause burnout of our local workforce and limit our companies\\' growth opportunities.We thank Mr Leong Mun Wai for his suggestions, many of which had been raised and debated at length in the past two years. At this year\\'s Committee of Supply (COS), MOM outlined the strategies and measures to help Singaporeans seize opportunities in the economy and be empowered to take on the good jobs. We will walk with Singaporeans every step of the way through new initiatives, such as Career Health and Careers Finder. But MOM cannot do this on our own. We seek everyone\\'s understanding that we need partnership with the industry, employers and the unions on this journey.Mdm Deputy Speaker, let me now speak on support for parents with young children. I have met many parents in my work at MOE and also as an MP. Most desire to be good parents and want the best for their children. But parents may not always know what is required as every child is unique and constantly growing up.I will touch on the support for parents by three groups: fellow parents, employers and the community. It is important to have a strong ecosystem of support for parents to make parenting a fulfilling journey. I believe children are more likely to grow up resilient and confident if parents guide and support them well.First, on the support for parents by parents. Almost all MOE schools have Parent Support Groups (PSGs) today. While the main objective of PSGs is to enable partnership between the school and parents to strengthen support for our students, they have also become a source of support for parents.Many of our PSGs are led by parent volunteers with experience in parenting and who are willing to serve as resource and peer supporters to fellow parents. Some of the parents continue to serve as PSG leaders after their children have graduated from school. I encourage parents to contribute or participate in the activities planned by the PSGs.There is much that PSGs can learn from one another too. MOE has set up PSG Support Circles, which are communities for PSGs to come together to support fellow parents in nurturing resilient and confident children. Some of the common interest topics that they have chosen to cover thus far include cyber wellness, mental well-being of children and forging stronger parent-child relationships. These parent-led initiatives seek to equip fellow parents in detecting signs of distress in children, learn where they can get help from and how parents and teachers can work together to support the development of children. An example is the \"Let Us Chat\" Programme that seeks to strengthen parent capabilities in building good relationships with their children to enhance their children\\'s mental well-being. This PSG programme has been shared with at least 30 schools. It focuses on understanding ways to build children\\'s self-confidence, self-awareness and self-regulation, encouraging an attitude of lifelong learning instead of over-emphasis on grades and understanding the underlying causes of children\\'s behaviour through productive parent-child conversations and relationships. Indeed, there is much more parents can achieve by learning together with fellow parents. Next, on support by employers. For parents who are working, having a workplace with supportive bosses and colleagues can make a lot of difference. It is understandable for parents with young children to need some time off occasionally to bring their child to the doctor, look after a child who has fallen ill, or simply to cheer their child on who is receiving a prize or performing in school. For employees with genuine needs, we have to find practical solutions for them to continue to meet their responsibilities at work and at home. Over the years, the Government has progressively enhanced leave provisions for childcare, infant care, maternity leave and paternity leave. These are definitely useful and well appreciated by parents with young children. I remember my maternity leave was eight weeks when I had my first child 20 years ago. When I had my second child, maternity leave was 12 weeks. By the time I had my third child, maternity leave was increased to 16 weeks. So, I really see in my own personal journey, progression in Government policies supporting families. Today, a working couple has altogether up to 22 weeks of leave in their baby\\'s first year. From 2024 onwards, Government-paid Paternity Leave will be doubled to four weeks and unpaid infant care leave will be increased from six days to 12 days per parent. Taken together, this means a working couple will have up to 26 weeks of leave in their child\\'s first year. That is half a year of parental leave to bond and care for their newborn.This is helpful for most working couples, but may not be enough for those who have not found viable childcare arrangements and those who have greater caregiving needs.I encourage employers to create workplaces that are supportive of employees with children. Employers that value their employees\\' well-being could benefit from stronger talent attraction and staff retention. Employers who would like to find out more of what they can do may refer to the Tripartite Standard on Work-Life Harmony. The Tripartite Standard lays out a set of recommended employment practices that recognises the varying priorities of employees at different stages of their lives and also how employers can support them in managing both work responsibilities and personal aspirations. The practices in the Tripartite Standard include providing at least two enhanced leave benefits, such as extended childcare leave and putting in place employee support schemes, such as annual family days for employees to enjoy extra time-out with their families.We also have the Tripartite Standard on flexible work arrangements (FWAs), which sets out best practices for employers to provide FWAs, be it flexi-place, flexi-time or flexi-workload. More companies are offering flexible work arrangements now than before the COVID-19 pandemic. This allows parents to better manage their work and family responsibilities concurrently. To entrench flexible work arrangements, MOM and the tripartite partners will introduce a set of Tripartite Guidelines by 2024. The Guidelines will require employers to consider requests for flexible work arrangements fairly and properly.While employers have the prerogative to accept or reject a FWA request, they must have valid reasons for their decision. At the same time, employees should be reasonable in their requests and use FWAs responsibly. Some FWAs may have resource implications for the company, which employers understandably need to consider when assessing the request. For FWAs to work for both employers and employees, adjustments may also have to be made to businesses and HR practices, possibly also to the way work is configured, to allow for the flexibilities.I would like to encourage employers to press on with efforts to make FWAs a reality for their employees where they can. In turn, I am confident that employers will reap the benefits of a more engaged and motivated workforce. This is a win-win outcome for everyone.Ultimately, successful implementation of FWAs requires trust between employer and employees as well as among colleagues at the workplace. Besides an understanding boss, a supportive workplace culture is important to enable working parents to achieve better work-life harmony.  Finally, the community can make a difference in supporting parents. This is especially helpful for vulnerable segments in our community. Community initiatives, such as mental well-being circles, mentorships, free tuition, grocery distributions and respite for caregivers, are just some of the many examples of how the community can chip in to help families in need.Many of these initiatives are led by non-government organisations (NGOs) and grassroots volunteers. We should encourage more of these ground-up initiatives and coordinate their efforts to achieve the best possible outcomes for the families being supported.The year 2022 was the Year of SG Families. We want to build a Singapore that is made for families. My wish is that Singapore will be one of the best places to raise children.Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong spoke about the refreshed social compact of collective responsibility where we need to be less about \"me\" and more about \"we\". It is about what each of us can do to support fellow Singaporeans.The Government will continue to find ways to support families. We will do our best to build a more caring and inclusive society with affordable housing, healthcare, childcare and education to cater to the different needs.To help defray the cost of raising children, we have also enhanced the Baby Bonus Cash Gift, Child Development Account (CDA) First Step and Baby Support Grant for eligible Singaporean children.But these steps alone may not be enough. As the saying goes, it takes a village to raise a child. Some families are blessed to have the help of grandparents and extended family in taking care of children at home while the parents are at work. Some families have alternative childcare support from domestic helpers, friendly neighbours and childcare centres in the neighbourhood. Not everyone is so lucky. Fellow parents, employers, colleagues and the community can play a part as well to make parenting a more joyful and fulfilling journey for all. Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Motion.Mdm Deputy Speaker: Ms Joan Pereira.',\n",
       " \"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I join my parliamentary colleagues in this Motion of thanks to the President for her address.Indeed, I agree with Mdm President that Singapore is one of the few countries in the world where trust between the Government and the people had strengthened after emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic. The events of the last three years highlight the important role Government leadership plays in unifying people and providing a clear direction forward for a nation to work towards.  Not only must leaders be competent, they must also demonstrate in the things they do and say that they have the nation's and the people's best interests at heart. Only by working together can the people and the Government overcome the challenges in their path.Leaders need to understand the big picture, balancing sometimes conflicting interests and ensuring that the pursuit of short-term goals do not compromise our long-term prospects.  The Government has implemented sound policies and measures but, sometimes, those who need help fall through the cracks for all kinds of reasons and we need to identify local community leaders and helping hands, including those in the private sector, who can close the gap in the last mile of assistance delivery. Madam, in Mandarin.(In Mandarin): Leaders need to understand the big picture and balance sometimes conflicting interests to ensure that the pursuit of short-term goals do not compromise our long-term prospects. The Government has implemented quite comprehensive policies and measures, but under certain circumstances, those who need help may not receive assistance for all kinds of reasons. We need to identify suitable community leaders, volunteers or private sector helping hands to close the gap in the last mile to ensure that they receive assistance.(In English): One example I know of was that of a family in distress. The head of this family was the eldest of a group of siblings. The family lives in my constituency.The eldest daughter was trying very hard to be independent and cope on her own while tapping on various assistance schemes. A staff at an organisation providing help was able to earn her trust and managed to persuade her to accept certain changes in the care arrangements for her siblings. Without this particular staff, in spite of the many available assistance schemes, the family would not be able to benefit from them. The ability to plug the gap in the last mile can determine the success or failure of our measures. Very often, the person to bridge the gap is a neighbour or a volunteer who is not as constrained by the rules and regulations of the system and can thus take certain steps to close the loop. We certainly need to nurture and strengthen our social and neighbourhood connectedness to enable the desired mutual help to happen.Of course, the essential ingredient here is trust. Government leaders have to earn the trust of our people so that in times of emergency and crisis, people will trust that they are doing the right thing for the good of the community and country.Leaders also have to be very mindful of how they act and what they say. The impact of even very simple gestures and words can be significant on the lives of the people they interact with.If I may share another example. President Halimah graced the opening ceremony of the Dyslexia Association of Singapore Henderson Learning Centre in March last year. She spoke with a student, Ardyani.Ardyani's education therapist, Ms Miranda, had shared with the centre manager, Mr Bala, that since then, she had noticed that Ardyani has become a little bit more cheerful and confident, participating a little more during lessons and also talking a little bit more to her classmates. Ardyani's mother also noticed that her daughter is less shy in engaging others. Ardyani herself shared that she felt very much encouraged by the President's kind words and gestures during their interaction. Leaders should realise that the impact of such small gestures in inspiring others, be it to encourage someone or to provide some form of support, can really go a long way. There are many leaders amongst us, be it in the Government, private sector, social service sector or among community leaders. I certainly hope and urge all of our leaders to continue to stay close to the ground and to our people, reaching out, touching lives and building more trust day by day. I support the Motion.Mdm Deputy Speaker: Mr Yip Hon Weng.\",\n",
       " 'Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would like to thank Mdm President for sharing her views on the Government\\'s plans and priorities for the remaining term of the Government. Today, I will focus my speech on the topic of ageing, specifically, the concept of productive longevity.We have made significant progress to support successful ageing in Singapore in the preceding half term of the Government. We raised the retirement age to help seniors stay active and engaged in society. Our CPF schemes were updated to better cater to the changing needs of the ageing population. We have strengthened our healthcare system through Healthier SG by focusing on preventive care. We are also scaling up healthcare and long-term care facilities in the community to better support our seniors.But there is still much more to be done. Being a country with one of the highest life expectancies in the world, but also one having the lowest birth rates, we face a double whammy. We must address the reality that every household in Singapore will eventually have a senior member.It is projected that by 2030, one in four Singaporeans will be aged 65 and above. This ratio is expected to increase further.This rapid expansion of our ageing population means that the productive engagement of our seniors is no longer optional. It will be an absolute necessity. We must encourage our seniors to engage in gainful activities that will not only benefit themselves, but also their families, communities and society as a whole.I will speak on three general areas – work, contribution and care for others – three areas which I believe are critical elements for productive longevity. First, Mdm Deputy Speaker, work. Steve Jobs once said, \"Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.\" Wise words, indeed. We can continue loving what we do even as we grow old. We must thereby support our seniors to work longer for those who want to, are healthy enough and still have the passion to do so.The relevant initiatives in this year\\'s Budget are a step in the right direction. It is heartening to note that our senior employability rate is healthy, compared to OECD countries. Correspondingly, we should focus on creating quality jobs for our seniors. This enables them to utilise their depth of knowledge and experience obtained over a lifetime.The health benefits associated with ongoing mental engagement are numerous. Moreover, mentoring and job-sharing allow seniors to pass on their skills to younger and less experienced employees.That said, it is important to recognise that many older workers desire part-time work with flexible options which allow them to spend time on leisure and with their families. I fully support the call for more flexible work options for seniors, as previously emphasised in my Committee of Supply speech.There are several ways that we can implement these options, such as sabbatical leave, job-sharing, micro jobs and phased retirement.These concepts are relatively new to our workforce. As such, there may be resistance and scepticism from employers. The Government should take the lead and show how they can be implemented with minimal disruption while still reaping the benefits.I urge the Government to take more proactive measures to introduce and incorporate these concepts into more places of employment.Second, Mdm Deputy Speaker, is the concept of giving. We must actively encourage our seniors to volunteer and share their skills with others. Silver years can be a time for renewal where individuals can explore new passions and interests, engage in meaningful activities and continue to contribute back to society. The numerous benefits of volunteering for seniors include better self-rated health, higher life satisfaction and prevention of cognitive decline over time.Organisations like RSVP Singapore are excellent partners in growing senior volunteerism. However, we should assess our current volunteerism framework and determine how we can increase volunteerism rates.How do we compare globally with other countries on this front? Are there specific targets that we have set ourselves in this area? Besides, it would also be helpful to consider other demographic factors, such as income level, gender, race and religion, to ensure that volunteering opportunities are inclusive and varied.Third, Mdm Deputy Speaker, we should enable care. Care for seniors and recognising caregivers\\' contributions. This includes providing informal caregivers with more support and professionalising caregiving as a career to meet the rising demand for caregiving needs. The role of a caregiver is a challenging one that requires significant physical and emotional effort.With our demographic shifts, we are also now seeing a greater number of seniors caring for other seniors. In my Yio Chu Kang estate, I have a 70-plus-year-old daughter caring for a 90-plus-year-old mother. This is becoming a regular scenario. Regrettably, we often see the bulk of caregiving responsibilities being shouldered by a single individual – typically a wife, mother or daughter.There remains a significant gender disparity in caregiving, with women assuming a disproportionate amount of the workload. Can we take steps to encourage men to participate more in caregiving? Achieving this will require us to challenge the societal norms and gendered attitudes that place greater emphasis on men building careers and less on caregiving responsibilities.It is essential to enhance caregiver training. This is to ensure that caregivers have the necessary skills to look after their loved ones competently. There are currently over 40 training providers offering more than 200 Caregivers Training Grant-approved courses. Nonetheless, it is pertinent to evaluate the effectiveness of these programmes. What is the current take-up rate and how beneficial do participants find these courses? Additionally, we need to increase awareness about the availability of these courses and ensure that the accessibility and scheduling meets the demand. How can the Government provide additional support in this area?Expanding caregiver support is critical, as Singapore\\'s population ages and more people require informal caregiving. MOH has taken steps to enhance caregiver support. Besides training, as mentioned earlier, over the years, enhancements have been made to financial support, caregiver respite services and platforms to help with care navigation. There have also been continued attempts to encourage flexible work arrangements (FWAs). It is also good that we are recognising that caregivers themselves, too, need self-care to prevent burnout. Can we explore ways to improve caregiver support, such as offering additional caregiver leave?  As the demand for caregiving services continues to grow, we should recognise caregiving as a viable career choice. Professionalising caregiving may attract more people to the profession and improve the quality of care provided. Presently, caregiving is often associated with tasks like medical escorting, personal care and housekeeping.On the contrary, caregiving extends beyond these roles. There are opportunities for specialisation and leadership, including caregiver trainers, managers, schedulers and care assessment professionals, just to name a few. To formalise these roles and provide the necessary training, we need to develop a scheme to professionalise caregiving.As part of long-term planning, we should also consider formal education to provide a solid foundation for professional caregiving and certification. For instance, many community colleges and healthcare agencies in the US offer courses to obtain home care certification. Highly skilled caregivers have more opportunities to service clients, especially those with specific needs, such as dementia or physical challenges.In conclusion, Mdm Deputy Speaker, with higher life expectancy, how will the \"good life\" look like? How can we fully embrace the opportunities that comes with living longer? I have shared in my speech that one way is to embrace productive longevity. It is to be empowered to lead our lives the way we want to – to work, contribute and care for others. To do so, we must also reframe our concept of ageing: first, it is not about when, but now. I circle back to what I said earlier in my speech – an often-quoted statistic – that by 2030, one in four Singaporeans will be aged 65 and above.But we must remember that ageing continues, as we speak. Currently, almost one in five Singaporeans are aged 65 and above. We see it all around us. I certainly see it in my estate in Yio Chu Kang. Over the past three years, I have seen how our residents have aged. It is very visible. More seniors are moving around in the neighbourhood with wheelchairs and walking aids. More requests for aged care services. More wakes to attend.Second, it is about opportunities, not about liabilities. Productive ageing requires a shift in our thinking from a paradigm centred on ageing as being problematic, to one which views seniors as resources – assets that can continue to contribute to society in various ways. It is about opportunities for growth and contribution, rather than casting the aged as a liability.Finally, we need to shift from \"them\" to \"us\". Ageing affects not just our seniors. Ultimately, it is about all of us. Growing old is inevitable. We will all grow old one day. A simple shift on using more inclusive terms, such as \"we\" and \"us\", in place of \"they\" and \"them\", helps all of us to remember that we are all ageing. Personally, I sometimes do get comments from my residents that I look young. But I remind myself that the operative word is \"look\" and that we will all grow old one day and be forced to reckon with our own mortality. We will all need to come to terms and embrace the experience of ageing.Finally, we all have different versions of what is the \"good life\". Notwithstanding, most will agree that to leverage productive longevity, we will need to embrace our silver years – to work, to contribute and to care, and by acknowledging that ageing is not about when, but now; it is about opportunities, not about liabilities; and it is not about them, but about us.Only then, can we turn the good life into a great one.Mdm Deputy Speaker: Mr Gan Thiam Poh.',\n",
       " 'Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Motion of Thanks to the President for her Address. Let me begin in Mandarin.(In Mandarin): I do not think anyone would object to the fact that more support should be given to our disadvantaged groups and lower-income earners to improve their lives and incomes. The key, though, is how we should do it more effectively and more sustainably. Just blindly subsidising people might leave them idle and run the risk of consuming the whole savings?As the saying goes: \"it is better to teach someone to fish, rather than to give him a fish.\"A fish can relieve your hunger pangs in the short term, but not for too long. If you want to have fish throughout your lifetime, you must learn how to fish. That is the best policy.(In English): \"Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.\" Hence, there is a need for the Government to continue to invest heavily in education, SkillsFuture, reskill and upskill training. The Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme, Progressive Wage Credit Scheme (PWCS) and Special Employment Credit (SEC) and so on and so forth are equally important. Whatever more to do or to be done, we should continue to leverage and enhance on our existing schemes.I agree with the President that in an increasingly troubled world, we must stay united and strengthen our bond as one united people. We are not only facing an aged population; we are also facing a declining fertility rate. Our Total Fertility Rate (TFR) hit an all-time low of 1.05 last year.Our old-age support ratio, computed as the ratio of the working-age population – meaning those 20 to 64 years old – per person aged 65 and above, has been declining, from 10.5 in 1990 to 3.8 in 2022, last year.However, the average education level of our population has increased over the same period and so has the average income. Hence, would the Ministry be able to advise if the current old-age support ratio is acceptable, in view of the rise in the average Singaporean\\'s income and the continued investment in education and lifelong learning and training for Singaporeans? We may also need to consider if we should let each generation self-finance their needs in old age, for example, using their life contributions to the nation to avoid burdening our children and grandchildren. At the same time, to survive and stay competitive, Singapore must remain open. But there is a limit to how many foreigners or new citizens any country can absorb before the sense of shared national identity is affected. We must maintain our Singaporean Core and, at the very least, prevent our TFR from declining further. I certainly hope that it is partly due to 2022 being the year of the tiger in the lunar calendar, which usually sees fewer births among the Chinese, and not another indication of a shrinking future generation.The pro-family measures announced in Budget 2023, with the Baby Support Grant extension, cash support, increased Paternity Leave and Unpaid Infant Care Leave, are, indeed, supportive of parenthood. I welcome the commitment made by the Prime Minister\\'s Office in the addendum to extend more help to parents caring for infants.We, as a nation, must continue to try to do more to boost marriage and parenthood. Firstly, the Government may need to play a bigger and more active role to bring our young men and women together. The proportion of singles in the age group below 50 years has increased and, more significantly, the increase is highest among those below age 35 – the age group which is most conducive for having children. We understand that people generally prefer to meet members of the opposite sex in so-called \"natural settings\", even though, for many, their networks and social circles are limited. Nonetheless, we should review how we can improve on facilitating social interactions for our potential couples. For example, I think it would be helpful to review and get feedback on the activities and events organised by the Social Development Network (SDN). What kind of activities and events do the young find attractive and relevant in today\\'s context? For example, do the participants get to learn or experience something meaningful, even if they do not meet someone special?If that is the case, SDN will be able to attract more participants, enlarging the pool and increasing the chances that singles will meet other interesting singles there, as SDN should also be able to offer a value-add which is to provide the assurance that all participants are screened and they are who they claim to be.The Ministry of National Development (MND) is making the effort to ramp up BTOs for all applicants, especially for first-timer families. We welcome the good news. It has many supportive policies which I commend, but I would like to make a request for future flats to be built bigger, like the older flats built in the 1980s and 1990s. A sense of greater available space is more encouraging for families to have a second or third child.From our experience from COVID-19, there is a need to review to expand the programme to build early, before the sale of the BTO flats, with shorter waiting time of 12 to 18 months.Many families with young children depend on migrant domestic workers (MDWs) and nannies to help out with caregiving. However, the standards of their service can vary widely. Is there any way for MOM to set up a training, assessment and accreditation scheme which parents can use to inform them of the capabilities of the maids or nannies they are considering to hire?There is a shortage of infant care, childcare and kindergarten teachers or centres in certain areas. For parents, it is important for their children to be enrolled in centres near their homes to minimise travelling for the kids. Will the Government look into the distribution of these centres and staff, how to attract teachers into these sectors and minimise the attrition rate?Next, I would like to move on to request for a review of measures to manage our national income gap. We have to continue our effort to minimise the social divide in our society. Values which divide high- and low-income groups should be discouraged and harmonious social integration needs to be strengthened.This also applies to the workplace. There is a need for employers to establish policies to nurture a harmonious and caring work culture in our workplaces. A good leader in the company is not only measured by tangible results. He must be able to motivate all his team members with different capabilities and abilities to work hand in hand and care for one another as a team.  We are a competitive society, but we must learn to embrace compassionate meritocracy, especially since we need to have more of the young in our workforce to support the aged.Last but not least, I would like to appeal for more assistance for the middle-income group who are burdened by inflation and rising costs and yet are not qualified for most of the assistance schemes which are targeted at lower-income groups. I would like to conclude with my support for the Motion.Mdm Deputy Speaker: Ms Foo Mee Har.',\n",
       " \"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the Motion to thank our President for her address.I support the determination of our Government to refresh our social compact and broaden meritocracy. Our efforts to build an egalitarian society where everyone will be treated equally with dignity and respect must continue. At the same time, we must reaffirm Singapore as an open society, expand our economic space and stay connected to global growth opportunities for Singapore to stay relevant and provide a bright future for Singaporeans.It is against this backdrop that I would like to speak about family offices in their role in contributing to Singapore's development. I declare my interest as CEO of the Wealth Management Institute (WMI). WMI is the host of the Global-Asia Family Office Circle, a network platform that provides a trusted environment for the family office ecosystem to convene as a community to learn about best practices in family office governance, as well as opportunities in Singapore and Asia in areas such as innovation, sustainability, co-investments and philanthropy.The number of wealthy individuals and family offices in Singapore continues to grow which is a testament to Singapore's strength as a hub wealth and asset management.There has been much interest about the arrival of family offices in Singapore recently. From my experience they come from a diverse range of countries from around the world, including Greater China, South Asia, ASEAN, the Middle East, US and Europe.Many of them represent some of the most successful entrepreneurs and business owners across the globe, including notable investors, leaders in renewable energy, pioneers of world-changing technology platforms and leaders of Asia's largest family businesses. These families do not just bring capital but also knowledge, networks, skills and talents as well. These are assets we can channel to support new innovation and enterprise, allowing businesses based in Singapore to benefit from mutual technological innovation and talent transfers.Some of these families also bring long track record of giving generously, sometimes stretching back across multiple generations. They have built schools and hospitals, funded scientific advancements, supported conservation efforts and contributed generously to relief efforts, including disaster recovery and pandemic recovery.Madam, these family offices are coming to Singapore for a variety of reasons. Some are seeking safety and stability, whereas others are expanding to Singapore in search of attractive investment opportunities to support growth in Asia – and Southeast Asia, especially.We are also seeing greater involvement of the next generation of family principals who are increasingly focused on areas such as impact investment, venture capital and alternative Investments.Madam, family offices are typically extremely private. So, recent reports of flashy and ostentatious behaviours are restricted to a minority. Inflows of funds are subjected to MAS' stringent rules of comprehensive client due diligence, including establishing a clear and legitimate purpose of the use of family office structure, ascertaining the ultimate beneficial owners and corroborating the sources of wealth and funds.We should welcome this inflow of family offices because they can bring many positive long-term benefits, but more can be done to accelerate their integration and contribution, and most importantly, orientate them to Singapore's norms, values and ways of working.Madam, the arrival of family offices in Singapore is still a relatively new concept. We have seen strong growth in a short period of time. This means that the industry is still nascent and many family offices are still in the initial stages of development.Family offices typically go through three phases as they set up in Singapore. First, they set up the governance, then investment, and finally, philanthropy and impact.The first stage – governance – is about establishing an effective operational base and putting in place a governance framework under which the family office will operate. Good governance requires careful consideration. How should they set up their legal and trust structures? What systems should they put in place, from financial monitoring to cybersecurity? What should their board and risk management processes be? How can they attract and hire the right talent in Singapore? Who should they appoint as their advisors? How can they meet the evolving regulations in Singapore which have been introduced to raise the bar?As they establish themselves, family offices contribute towards job creation, both directly and indirectly. Even though family offices are typically small in team size, they have to meet requirements on hiring, annual business spending and local investments. The key impact of their set-up in terms of job creation will be driving the additional demand and job creation and professional services such as wealth management, asset management, fund administration, trusts, legal, tax and consulting.Since 2020, WMI has had over 1,500 enrolments for family office-related programmes, in testament to the strong appetite for upskilling in this area.Madam, with the office and governance structure in place, family offices then focus on investments. Family capital is valuable because it can be a useful complement to institutional capital – it can be more flexible, agile and catalytic, often in line with the values of the family.Investments are often the main purpose of the family office. However, before they deploy a large amount of capital or any amount of capital, family offices need to build a robust understanding of the investment landscape so that they can home in on areas of opportunity. Fundamentally, they seek good financial returns and sound business models to invest in, and this often takes time to understand and evaluate the different investment options available. Also, the market environment in recent years has been challenging.They also need to find like-minded partners for co-investments. Many family offices tell us they prefer to co-invest with other families – but only with those that they know and trust. A newly-arrived family office will need to build up these trusted networks before they can co-invest effectively.One current gap is the lack of a systematic on-boarding process to integrate newly-arrived wealthy individuals into Singapore’s enterprise and investment ecosystem so they can become active members of our venture community. There is also a need to help them become aware of the promising research and tech innovations that we have in Singapore from our startup communities and research institutes and where they can help commercialise and scale promising new ideas.Family offices tell us they struggle to navigate the fragmented and fast changing landscape. They share that they need to work hard to understand who the credible players are and what the roles of different ecosystem actors are.Newly set-up family offices need more help to connect the dots of the full spectrum of what Singapore has to offer. We need to help orientate them towards the local ecosystem and curate a systematic introduction to the different areas within the innovation community. This will help fast-track capital deployment.Madam, the third area that family offices consider is how to contribute to impact and philanthropy initiatives, usually across a wide continuum of different ways of doing good. Many family offices actually have a stated objective to give back, in line with their family values.But conducting effective philanthropy is a thoughtful process going beyond cheque-book giving. The inspiration is often deeply personal and tied to the values of the family. Based on these values, families will decide what their impact goals are and which causes to support, what assets they could contribute and how to leverage different giving structures. Giving structures take time to establish.Increasingly, wealthy families want to go beyond straightforward grant-making type philanthropy. They aspire to tap their financial resources and networks in creative ways to make impact. We must evolve our charity policies to support new forms of giving, including venture philanthropy, concessionary capital to impact investing. Madam, in my previous speech, I spoke about generations of Singaporeans having benefited from visionary philanthropists and organisations including the likes of Tan Kah Kee, P Govindasamy Pillai and Ngee Ann Kongsi, among many others. They have contributed to important social services, public healthcare and education, and cultivated a culture of giving that is central to Singapore’s social compact.Today, many among the new generation of wealth owners have a similar aspiration to contribute meaningfully to society. So, what is needed is greater effort to drive awareness and momentum to support both local and regional causes. We should also encourage sharing from family offices who are already major philanthropists, to provide aspirational examples for others.Initiatives such as the recent launch of the Impact Philanthropy Partnership, led by WMI and the Private Banking Industry Group with the support of MAS, will help galvanise more family offices in this area.Madam, in conclusion, today, as Singapore continues to be an attractive destination for global wealthy individuals, our doors will always be open for those who desire and can co-create purposeful wealth with us. To preserve our social compact, it is critical that they are orientated to integrate with Singapore’s social norms and have the right support and access to networks, so that they can ramp up their contributions in terms of investments and impact.Through this, we can make the most of this unique opportunity to shape this growth towards a more inclusive society for the benefit of all. With this, I support the Motion.Mdm Deputy Speaker: Mr Murali Pillai, would you like to adjourn the debate?\",\n",
       " \"Mr Speaker, I rise in support of the Motion. “A Different World, “realities we have to adapt to”, “As a small nation we must take the world as it is”, “challenges” and “opportunities”. These were points highlighted by President Halimah in her speech at the Opening of the second session of this 14th Parliament. But she reminded us that “we are far from powerless”. Our history and what we have achieved as a nation today has shown that our strength has and continues to be our people and our will as one people, government, businesses and citizens “working together to make the improbable possible”.There are many important aspects that President Halimah has covered in her speech and plans that the Ministries have also outlined in the various addenda to her speech. In my speech today, I will touch on two areas which I feel are important for Singapore and Singaporeans to be ready and more importantly, confident for the changes we are facing and to remain relevant now and in the future.They are: one, education and continual learning – to equip Singaporeans and expand opportunities throughout life for all; and two, a society that values and support families.Let me now touch on education and continual learning. For our young: with the fast pace of change and rapid digitalization across many aspects of work and life, what we teach, how we teach and when learning happens has changed and will need to continue to transform.In schools, we are preparing our young for work and careers that do not exist today. The Ministry of Education (MOE)’s addendum to the President’s Address outlines its commitment to quality education and strong foundation for every child while breaking new ground to adapt to the changing landscape.It is heartening that MOE will invest more in preschool education especially for children from disadvantaged families. Studies have shown that access to quality childcare and early childhood education develops foundational skills and helps boost math and reading in children.For our young, building strong foundational knowledge and skills including STEM is crucial. With rapid digitalisation, technology skills need to be part of core curriculum. With how technologies are evolving and the potential benefits and risks they pose, technology skills are essential not only to enable use and leverage of these technologies and tools. Equally important is the understanding of the pros and cons to enable discernment and appropriate use. For example, the benefits of ChatGPT, which everyone has been talking about. ChatGPT gives the ease of use with human-like conversations, extensive applications to produce text, images, music and code – to just name a few.But just last week an article in The Straits Times highlighted what seemed realistic artificial intelligence (AI) generated images that surfaced in recent months and the difficulty to differentiate a fake photo from the real one. There are both benefits and risks as AI and new technologies continue to play a bigger role in our work and lives. With increasing use of technologies, there are rising concerns around privacy, biases and discrimination. Policies are needed to protect, but with a balance so as not to impede the benefits to be derived from these technologies. This is an area that the Government will need to continue to monitor and manage.In a fast-changing landscape and with disruptions, we will need to be agile and adapt quickly. Adapting is not just about being flexible and making changes rapidly but making the right changes. The irony is that in order to deal with changes and to be confident in making the right changes, it will require effort to understand and discern. Acquiring knowledge is essential but not sufficient. The need to analyse data and information, to ask questions and understand in order to use and build on the knowledge is essential. To be adaptable, our students will need to build their problem-solving skills and creativity.With the pace of change and the complexity of the changing landscape, to prepare our students for success, we must also develop them to collaborate well with others and to communicate confidently to articulate their ideas and thoughts.  As outlined in the MOE addendum, how teaching is done in our schools has evolved. An example is Subject-Based Banding which caters to the diverse interest and needs of students by allowing secondary school students to learn subjects based on their strengths and learning needs. To support our students to be able to collaborate and communicate effectively, schools will also need to continue to provide ample opportunity for students to do team-based learning around projects and problem solving. These skills will train our students to collaborate with diverse groups and also require them to communicate effectively. This will prepare our students and give them life skills and the confidence for opportunities in Singapore and overseas both in school and in the future.  Let me now touch on those in the workforce. With people living longer and healthier, our workforce is multi-generational. The needs and experience of workers differ between generations in the workforce. This is an advantage if we are able to tap the diversity of the workforce. I have made this point in several of my speeches in this House that we need to rethink the structure of work to make learning and training systemic for workers of different age groups and stages of life. With change, people of all ages in the workforce will need to acquire knowledge at each stage of their careers and lives. Apart from work, workers have to manage their different obligations and life stages, hence learning has to be organised and accessible both online and hybrid-enabled access to learning to fit the learning needs and the different obligations, life stages and schedules of our workers. COVID-19 has also brought fundamental changes and shown us the possibilities of how work can be organised and where work can be done. These can provide opportunities to attract and retain workers as well as tap a larger pool of talent. But to do so, will require fundamental shifts in mindsets and policies around work arrangements including flexible work arrangements and even retirement age.President Halimah touched on the need for broader and a more open meritocracy to allow every Singaporean to have the opportunity to take on meaningful work that tap on their strengths and to be rewarded fairly for it. I feel that our schools, Institutions of Higher Learning and our SkillsFuture programmes, have and do provide pathways for learning, training, certification and credentials to recognise the skills acquired for our students and those in the workforce. What we need is for businesses and society to recognise skills, competencies and experiences of workers of all ages and qualifications, and not just academic levels of attainment for job opportunities and qualification. Now let me touch on our society and the value of support for families. The family plays an important and central role in our society. The family provides our sense of belonging in society and are our first line of support and care.With an aging population and people living longer, families are multi-generational and caregiving needs will increase. With smaller families, some families need to care for both the young and seniors.Mean-testing qualifying criteria for caregiving support for middle-income Singaporeans may work against some middle-income families that care for their family members. For example, a middle-income household living in a private property taking care of aged parents or siblings may not qualify for any relief or subsidy for eldercare services because of housing type.Let me relate an example from a recent house visit I did. Our resident, Mdm Lee – not her real name – shared with me her worries on the long-term care needs for her brother. Mdm Lee and her husband are in their 60s and do not have children. They live in a terrace house with her brother, aged 65 years old, her sister who is in her 50s and an aged mother in her early 90s. The family are a close-knit family. Mdm Lee's brother suffered from poliomyelitis which affected his speech and mobility and he is unable to care for himself. In fact, during the COVID-19 period, it was really quite trying for this family in terms of caregiving needs.Mdm Lee shared with me that the family do not qualify for any Government subsidies because of housing type. As her husband and her, and her siblings are either retired or nearing retirement, she is worried about affordability for her brother's long-term care when his condition gets worse and he needs to stay in a nursing home. Mdm Lee and her sister currently pay for his medical expenses as he does not have any medical insurance coverage. The irony is that if Mdm Lee's brother or mother did not live with Mdm Lee and lived in a HDB flat, her mother and brother would qualify for support for eldercare services and nursing home. But Mdm Lee and her family believe that staying together contributes to the overall well-being and care of their mother and brother.I appeal for a review of the criteria for qualifications for support for eldercare services and intermediate and long-term to better support families as they care for their loved ones. I am not saying that we discount the means testing, I think that is required. But we need to think about the flexibility and also the circumstances and sometimes, we do it on a case-by-case basis. But as our population is ageing, I think we will have more and more of such scenarios. Mr Speaker, our People are at the core of Singapore's past, present and future. In this complex and rapidly changing world, while the Government has to do more, our businesses, citizens and society too have to do our part. Working as One People, we have been able to weather challenges and emerge stronger. I am confident that as One People, we will move forward together to address challenges and seize opportunities.Mr Speaker: Ms Sylvia Lim.\",\n",
       " 'Mr Speaker, as someone born in the 1960s, my cohort-mates and I find ourselves straddled between our seniors and the young. On the one hand, we are young enough to use many forms of social media, but not young enough to use youth slang like \"OOTD\", outfit of the day, and \"IYKYK\", if you know, you know. [Laughter.] We are old enough to remember the feverish days of the Malaysia Cup; but are a little too old to banter about the latest K-drama heartthrobs – though to be fair, I can name one or two.Thus, placed between seniors and the young, I wish to focus my speech today on these two demographic profiles that bookend society at opposite ends. I wish to ask how we could give greater confidence to seniors and the young, to assure them that they are indispensable parts of our social fabric. Put another way, how do we build a country for all ages?One attitude that will erode solidarity across generations is the tendency towards ageism. Ageisim can be directed against both older people and the young as well. I will touch on these today.First, on seniors. According to the World Health Organization (WHO)\\'s Global Report on Ageism (2021), about one out of every two persons worldwide habours ageist attitudes. Ageism manifests itself in our minds, when we stereotype people based on age; it manifests in our feelings, when we harbour prejudice; and finally, it manifests in our actions, when we discriminate against people.WHO notes that ageism can exist at three levels. First, at the institutional level, when laws, policies and social norms restrict or disadvantage individuals based on age. Second, ageism exists at the interpersonal level, in interactions between two or more individuals. Finally, ageism could be self-directed, when it is internalised by those who are discriminated, who then accept it and behave in ways that make it a self-fulling prophecy.Sir, there is ageism everywhere, though we may not call it such by name. Here are some instances. One of my residents who is 97 and in excellent health, likes to go around asking anyone she meets in Teochew: \"I am 97 years old this year. Are you afraid of me?\" When we hear of someone so senior, some of us would, with good intentions, over-protect the person or assume that the person needs help, without stopping to think that everyone ages differently. We have also come across single elderly people who need to rent rooms to stay due to disagreements with their family but are rejected by landlords in view of their advanced age. Think also of the millions of dollars spent on hair dyes and anti-aging products, so as to present a younger image of ourselves for fear that we might otherwise not be taken seriously. There is also a sexist element to this, where professional men with grey hair are respected but women with grey hair doubted; but that deserves a more detailed discussion on another day.Ageist attitudes are also familiar in the workplace. How often do we hear of middle-aged job-seekers who report that once their age is revealed to the prospective employer, they would receive a polite response to wait for a follow-up call, which does not come? Indeed, in a survey released last March, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) confirmed that ageist attitudes were still prevalent in the Singapore workplace, affecting older workers.The recent global COVID-19 pandemic, too, saw ageism rear its ugly head. A United Nations independent expert, Dr Claudia Mahler, noted that the pandemic restrictions and lockdowns had resulted in a wave of ageist comments and hate speech; older persons were blamed as the reasons for lockdowns and labelled as vulnerable and burdens to societies.To combat ageism, the WHO highlights three strategies: first, through laws and policies; second, through public education and third, by increasing inter-generational contacts. How is Singapore doing in these aspects?At the official or policy level, there are positives in Singapore. We see many health-related initiatives towards active ageing, including the latest Healthier SG initiative. The Government is also looking into more options for seniors to age in place instead of in an institution and for assisted living accommodation that preserves the individual\\'s autonomy to make decisions. Such preservation of an individual\\'s autonomy is a precious tenet that we can also see in legislation such as the Mental Capacity Act (MCA). Under the MCA, donees and deputies must give weight to the preferences of the incapacitated person as far as possible.On the employment front, there are policies to incentivise employers to hire older workers through wage offset schemes such as the Senior Employment Credit. Nevertheless, for stronger protection for all workers, we are still eagerly awaiting the anti-discrimination legislation which the Prime Minister announced nearly two years ago. Apart from laws and policies, the other two strategies that are likely to have more impact are public education and increasing intergenerational contacts.As far as public education is concerned, what more can be done?For our students, we could review our education curriculum from primary to tertiary, to remove any ageist stereotypes and dispel any misconceptions about certain age groups.On employment, I note the efforts of MOM to encourage our employers to hire older employees and embrace multi-generational teams. The Government should always lead by example.Another aspect is to watch our public discourse, including debates in Parliament. Ministers and Members of Parliament should avoid making statements that may inadvertently perpetuate ageism, such as: \"By the year 2030, we will face a silver tsunami\", which evokes all the wrong images.As for increasing intergenerational contacts, I fully support HDB\\'s move to evolve from building blocks with only senior apartments, to having mixed blocks of flats for seniors and flats owned by younger families. This provides opportunities for cross-generation neighbourly activities such as gardening, games and mutual care. Another Singapore initiative was cited positively by the WHO – that of pairing seniors from activity centres with young people to play video games together.Research has shown that the benefits of such intergenerational contacts go beyond reducing ageist attitudes; they also benefit older people in improved health and psychosocial well-being, reducing distress and loneliness. They also strengthen intergenerational solidarity. We should continue to promote more intergenerational contacts.From older people, I next move on to the young. In the President’s Address, she highlighted that youths showed a strong interest to take action and initiate change on issues they cared about. She affirmed that the Government would engage the ideas, dynamism and energy of young Singaporeans.In the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY)’s addendum to the President\\'s Address, it was further stated that the Government would encourage more youths to engage in constructive civic discourse, through platforms such as the Youth Circles and the Youth Action Challenge. MCCY said it would continue to create new platforms to give youth the opportunities to shape Singapore.However, in a TODAY media report the next day, some young people expressed cynicism about existing forms of engagement. Several interviewees argued that the engagement had to go beyond just talking, but should enable young people to have direct participation in governance and policy formulation. One person doubted that the views of young people would be accepted unless those views aligned with the Government’s own ideals.Whatever the views expressed, there was common ground that any engagement should foster in young people a sense of responsibility.I believe it is worthwhile to distill what the priorities of our young citizens actually are. What are the issues young people care about? While the President highlighted mental health and sustainability, it would be wrong to interpret this as meaning that young people only care about “woke” issues such as climate change or discrimination.In my past work as a polytechnic lecturer, I could see in my students concerns about their parents, making ends meet and how to improve themselves and their families’ station in life. In an article published in the Workers’ Party (WP) Hammer last year, WP Youth Wing President Nicole Seah also shared that young people had many concerns that crossed generations, such as the affordability of public housing, cost of raising a family and employment opportunities.We must be careful not to pigeonhole young people’s issues into a handful of areas and only seek to engage them on those. That would be a big turn-off and a disservice to our young.Besides not restricting the areas for youth participation, we must also ask what sort of participation would convince our young people of a direct role in governance and policy-making. There is some indication that the many conversations so far conducted have led to conversation fatigue and skepticism. Cynicism about talking and consultations is understandable, as these are simply input which will eventually either be incorporated or thrown out by decision-makers.Of course, the empowerment of young Singaporeans need not and should not be a top-down affair. Young citizens can and should seize the day, and organise themselves around the causes they care about, adding to the richness of society through such ground-up initiatives.Nevertheless, I believe one change that should be made is to give younger cohorts a direct say in our national elections by lowering the voting age from 21 to 18 years. I raised this matter in this House 16 years ago and most recently again in this year’s Committee of Supply debates. The Government’s consistent response has been \"no\". This is despite Singapore being among a handful of countries in the world that has not reduced its voting age to 18 years, such as Bahrain, Cameroon, Tonga and the UAE. In the Government’s latest response this year, the Minister basically said that those between 18 and 21 years old do not have the skillsets required to cast their votes. I wonder how many citizens agree with this assessment.Sir, it is worthwhile remembering that ageism can equally be directed against the young. To this end, it could be well be argued that when we require male Singaporeans to serve National Service at 18 years, but only permit them to vote at 21 years, this is a form of age-based discrimination.As I said in February, in the 1960s, the movement in the United States to bring down the voting age to 18 years gained momentum when youths below 21 were drafted to fight in the Vietnam War. The slogan ran: “Old enough to fight, old enough to vote!”Sir, let me conclude. For Singapore to fully harness the energy of every citizen, we must foster a dynamic environment where ageist stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination are blown away. This is not something for the Government alone, but requires marshalling the whole-of-society. Each of us needs to examine ourselves too, to see how we individually can contribute to this endeavour in our everyday interactions. If Singapore is to be built to last, we must, together, build a Singapore for all ages.Mr Speaker: Mr Christopher de Souza.',\n",
       " 'Sir, as we move into the second session of Singapore\\'s 14th Parliament, I would like to thank Mdm President for charting out the course ahead as we transition into a different world post-pandemic.Mdm President spoke of the need for our unity and to strengthen our social fabric through emphasis on our core values of fairness, inclusivity, mutual support and giving back to society.One avenue in which we can accomplish this is through expanding opportunities throughout life for all, regardless of individual backgrounds and circumstances. I believe this starts with education.Mdm President spoke of providing every child a good education but not wanting to increase the stresses in an \"educational arms race\". I wholeheartedly agree with this. Earlier this year, during the Budget debate 2023, I spoke on right-sizing our syllabus and increasing affiliations between schools. Today, I would like to elaborate more on that, for I feel it is in-sync with what Mdm President charted out last Monday.On education, firstly, right-sizing our syllabus involves asking ourselves how do we truly want to prepare our young people for a different world they are growing up in. The way our world has changed and keeps changing and with the influx of knowledge and technology and AI, we cannot focus on getting the best test scores or merely having the most knowledge.Increasing affiliations between a primary and secondary school can lift the burden of thinking about which school to go on to after the PSLE. We should not go down the route of an educational arms race. One key way to stop this is to reduce the syllabus. I am not saying it is the only way, but making the syllabus less voluminous will reduce the reliance on tuition to play catch-up. An educational arms race has incentivised a tuition culture. And if we do not stop the race now, our students are going to end up hitting a brick wall. We must avoid that. We must inject the joy of learning instead of reliance on tuition to play catch-up on the syllabus.An educational arms race has built in a tuition culture, where students are caught between doing school homework and tuition homework such that they are possibly, busier on weekends than they are on week days.Secondly, Sir, I would suggest reducing class sizes from 40 to less than 30. MOE\\'s addendum to the President\\'s Address, focuses on being able to better customise teaching and learning for students of differing abilities to bring out the best in each child. I believe one way this can be accomplished is to have a smaller class size to allow teachers to have more time with each student. This can lead to more individualised attention, a greater capacity to monitor each student\\'s physical, mental and emotional well-being and the ability to tailor learning speeds and to cater to different learning styles.Instead of students having to go for tuition, smaller classes can help better pacing, so each student can learn and keep abreast of the subject within class time itself. This can also allow students to have opportunities to speak out and participate more, which would be especially helpful for students who learn as they verbalise.Another focus is helping students with Special Educational Needs in mainstream schools. By reducing class sizes, teachers will have more capacity to assist with the educational experience of these students and to allow the space for interactions between all the students in the class under the teacher\\'s supervision.Of course, reducing class sizes must mean we need more teachers and I believe it will be a step in the right direction. Our teachers choose their profession because of the value they see in raising students to their full potential and derive much intrinsic joy from it. But the tendency for teachers to be overworked and burnt out is known, especially in the past few years where they had to cope with many, many changes.Our teachers go far beyond just the academics as they often counsel students and help those struggling with mental health. By taking on more teachers and reducing class sizes, we can build a better environment, both for students and teachers. That is, at least, in my humble view.In right-sizing our syllabus and having an appropriate class size, we put in place the foundational stepping stones to inculcate in our young, the love of learning. Perhaps, in tweaking our syllabus, that may make way to craft more opportunities for students to visit museums and libraries, and have more moments to play which is essential for creativity.Sir, I move onto my second point. Mdm President encouraged us to move ahead together, even in the face of many changes the world presents us now.Sir, this means caring for the vulnerable. A recent topical concern is protecting our vulnerable citizens from scams. Therefore, Sir, the other issue that deeply concerns me as we progress as a nation is the increasing prevalence of scams. Many of the residents I serve in the constituency, have come to me at the Meet-the-People Session (MPS) or share with me during home visits their distressing stories about how they have lost tens of thousands, if not, hundreds of thousands of dollars to scammers.Prevention involves both building an infrastructure of laws and harnessing technology to detect and dismantle criminal organisations as well as preparing our people, both young and old, to deal with this threat. The scale of this threat cannot be underestimated. The variety of scams – from investment scams to e-commerce scams – all focus on one thing: targeting a specific vulnerability of a targeted group. The scammers are highly sophisticated in directing different scams to different age groups and taking advantage of cognitive biases to psychologically manipulate people into giving more details and transferring larger amounts of money.What accentuates this challenge is the transnational nature of the issue, with 90% of the scams from overseas and how technologically savvy the scammers are in using various digital platforms to carry out the scams. So, to tackle this, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) need to work with the Singaporean public, the banks and our partners from other countries. In particular, I believe we have to double down and raise a proper bulwark with our banking security systems.Instead of just saying what the problem is, I humbly suggest some solutions. These include placing limits on transactions, giving phone calls to owners of bank accounts to ensure they do want to proceed on a transaction, spotting suspicious patterns in consecutive transactions and a kill switch which can be activated by the bank if it detects multiple and suspicious outflows of monies from citizens\\' accounts.In the constituency I serve and when I meet with residents, I have seen physically, bank statements of residents with multiple outflows of monies, just under the transaction limit each time. I have seen bank statements where this happens between 2.00 am and 8.00 am, multiple withdrawals under the limit. And then, when they wake up, the poor residents are $70,000 poorer.This should raise alarm bells and in my view, prompt the bank to halt the transactions altogether until further verification is obtained or at least contact the customer to ensure that these are legitimate withdrawals.We have also to consider the new safeguards we should put in place. For example, e-wallets make transactions far quicker, but do they have the same safeguards in place? I think it is time that we consider what trade-offs we make between advancing \"frictionless\" transactions on the one hand, and putting in place enough safeguards to protect our people.We must look at how we can mitigate the effect of the scam. The Anti-Scam Command has taken the commendable lead in this in freezing 16,700 bank accounts just last year and recovering over $146 million. But that is out of 31,728 scams just in 2022 and over $660 million reported to have been stolen.In addition, I humbly think we also need to consider how we should put in place better support and compensation for those who lose their life savings. For many of the elderly who are scammed, the loss is often at least six figures, which is close to their entire retirement savings. Often, the compensation offered by the bank is insufficient for them to retire on. That would leave many of our seniors having to find more work. That may not be ideal at all if the couple is already in retirement. I really believe this is a group of people we must stand alongside.Sir, with these two priorities in mind in the field of: one, education, and, separately, two, protecting vulnerable groups from scammers, I stand in strong support of the Motion.Mr Speaker: Mr Leon Perera.',\n",
       " 'Mr Speaker, Sir, in my maiden speech in Parliament over seven years ago, I argued that the Singapore glass is half full. While there are always areas for improvement, we have done well with governmental efficiency and urban planning relative to other countries.However, back then I said that we have not done as well in fostering strong non-state actors and institutions to balance a strong state. And I would add now, we have not done as well in fostering a strong sense of participation in our democracy; a sense that we can speak out and, if needed, disagree with the dominant narrative, with our views actually having a chance to make a difference.An article by Tan and Preece in the Asian Journal of Comparative Politics in December last year reads, and I quote, \"We find that mechanisms of diagonal accountability related to media and civil society have declined. Vertical and horizontal accountability remains weak.\" Published research from the book \"The Well-being of Singaporeans\" by Tambyah, Tan and Kay in 2010, reaches similar conclusions. They cite survey data to show that 56% of Singaporeans agree with the statement that, generally speaking, people like me do not have the power to influence Government policy or actions, while another 23% are neutral. Only 20% disagreed.Countries that succeed in drawing strong participation in democracy will be more successful in fostering a confident populace, a people who deeply feel that this is my country, my home, a place where my voice counts for something, a place that I will sacrifice to defend.We all want Singapore to be a country where everyone feels that they have a chance at realising their full potential and giving life to their dreams. A place where tomorrow can be better than today for ourselves and, even more so, for our children and grandchildren. Not a place where many cannot even envisage a better tomorrow; not a place where economic pressure and ever-intensifying competition from school to workplace lead to ever greater stratification in living conditions, social capital and social standing.Sir, the first part of my speech will examine how we can cultivate an active citizenry while keeping politics and political discourse fair, vibrant and constructive. The second part will address how we can build economic optimism, so as to create a virtuous cycle of economic dynamism. The third part will suggest \"a Singapore model\" that can be a beacon for the region and also a bulwark against attempts by great powers to suborn or divide us.Firstly, on politics and political discourse. President Halimah\\'s speech called for \"an active citizenry\" and \"a passionate civil society\". She also spoke of the importance of avoiding political polarisation and gridlock, having trust between \"our political leadership and people\" and keeping political discourse respectful and rational.Such calls are not new. But as I reflected on this, I found that my unease was captured in a public comment from former media editor and academic Bertha Henson. I will quote an excerpt here: \"I am always bemused when I hear politicians warning Singaporeans against such \\'polarisation\\'. Our politics is nowhere as partisan. We do not have a two-party system yet nor a civil society which will take to the streets. Yet, we hear about divisive politics as though we are teetering on the edge of an abyss….I don\\'t think we should be guarding against \\'divisive politics\\' but rather \\'mono-politics\\': that there is only one narrative, one view and it must necessarily be the right or the best perspective – unless you don\\'t trust me. That is too tall an order for any citizen to submit to.\"Let us unpack and interrogate some of these assumptions in what I term \"the dominant narrative\". Firstly, do we want an active citizenry that feels that it is worth participating in politics by speaking out, listening, caring and getting involved in political discourse vs just retreating into private life? I think we should and I hope all hon Members want that. And if we take that ideal seriously, we should never treat differences of opinion as necessarily equivalent to polarisation.Polarisation happens only if some groups of people oppose others for the sake of opposing and not in a reasonable, fair-minded way. Polarisation happens only if vindictiveness and tribalism trump thoughtfulness and basic human decency. No pun intended in the use of the verb \"trump\", by the way.Secondly, disagreement and agreeing to disagree does not imply disrespect. One can disagree with respect, courtesy and decency. It seems that everyone, nowadays, welcomes that well-worn phrase \"robust debate\". But we do sometimes hear in this House that the other side has not explained the trade-offs properly and, therefore, was being dishonest in some sense.During very major recent debates in this House, the Opposition explained how there were alternatives to a GST hike that would slow the rate of growth of reserves; and that there were alternatives to a housing ecosystem based on the promise of asset appreciation and that these alternatives would lead to some weakening in the resale market.Were those trade-offs denied, hidden, glossed over? No. The trade-offs were explained. I think in our political discourse and even in our debates in this House, we should strive to treat Members\\' views and other parties\\' views fairly and accept when there is a philosophical or ideological difference, call it what you will, rather than being too quick to label the other side as \"disingenuous\". Such labels can affect the tone of discourse in the wider society, if alternative ideas become demonised or labelled uncharitably. Rather than chip away at trust in the Opposition with such labels, the Government should focus on explaining why it disagrees with the Opposition.Thirdly, on the need to keep political discourse rational, I do not think anyone would disagree with this. However, to have rational political discourse, we need transparency of information. We do not always get this. There are many examples of Parliamentary Questions that do not elicit the information requested without an explanation as to why that is the case. Sometimes, outcomes of public consultation are not made public. There is a great deal of public opinion surveying done by the Government, some of it through opinion-sensing agencies like Rysense, for example. Not all of this is made available for public scrutiny and debate.Lastly, I come to the oft-repeated call for trust in Government. I think trust in the independent institutions of the state is a very good thing, where it is warranted. But should the public blindly trust the Government as in the political leadership, regardless of whether relevant information has been shared; regardless of what the Government says or does? Surely not. That goes against the active citizenry which the President\\'s speech referred to.Sir, some speak of a democracy of deeds. But surely, we do not want a citizenry that is active in deeds, but blind, apathetic or timid in thinking. Such a citizenry may engage in the wrong deeds. And to trust the Government – does that mean that, since the Government and Opposition sometimes disagree and not, hopefully, irrationally, does that mean that it is right that the public distrust the Opposition? Surely not.We should not strive for a political landscape where the public innately trusts the Government, but innately distrusts the Opposition or vice versa. If any Member disagrees with this, please, I would love to hear your views later. We should strive, rather, for a politically educated populace that accords trust based on facts and evidence from independent institutions that function as intended.What can we do to strengthen everyone\\'s confidence that we have an open society, where citizens can and should care, listen, understand and debate policies? How can we make everyone believe that there is a more level-playing field for ideas, and not primarily one dominant narrative that you would do well not to challenge?In the interest of time, I will suggest just a few ideas to advance towards this goal which WP Members of Parliament (MPs) have expanded on in previous debates in this House.One, delink the People\\'s Association from the ruling party. The current system creates a sense that state resources are invested in promoting the Government\\'s thinking and the ruling party\\'s politicians, which unlevels the playing field for politics and ideas in our nation. My hon friend, Aljunied MP, Mr Faisal Manap, will elaborate on this.Two, create an ombudsman with investigative capacity to strengthen confidence that the state and ruling party are accountable and cannot simply shut down a grievance that may be politically costly or for other reasons. At the very least, a second unbiased opinion would be of value. I have argued for this at length previously, as have other WP MPs.Three, ensure that funding for civil society, the arts and so on is handled by independent committees who are not linked to the Government of the day. This would certainly help build the passionate civil society that President Halimah spoke of and counter any fears that civil society groups that advocate alternative policies to the Government may be penalised using state resources.Four, since we do not have a Freedom of Information Act, we should publish every single public opinion poll and data collection effort conducted with state funds, redacted only for anything that has clear and strong commercial or national security sensitivities for better-informed debate amongst political parties, civil society groups and citizens.Five, allow Opposition MPs to engage school students in their MP capacity, alongside ruling party MPs and Ministers, a subject I have raised in this House before. We need to mould the mental habits of our citizens from a young age to nurture independent, critical thinking.Exposing them only to People\\'s Action Party (PAP) politicians in schools and barring non-PAP ones in most student engagement contexts does not achieve this. Our future citizens need to be able to see both sides of a question, in a way that will inoculate them from the demagogues and foreign interference attempts of the future.Sir, we must not allow any sense to congeal that there is one dominant narrative and that everyone who has a different view has to be marginalised or go on the defensive.I now come to the second part of my speech on the optimism of Singaporeans. Will tomorrow be better than today?According to the 2023 Edelman Trust Barometer survey, only 36% of respondents in Singapore felt that their families will be better off economically in five years\\' time, only 36%, the lowest level for this measure since Edelman started surveying 23 years ago. This 36% for Singapore compares with the 40% global average across 24 countries.Sir, the Leader of the Opposition spoke of the risk of there becoming two Singapores. Right now, close to 50% of households live in 5-room HDB flats or more expensive homes, private homes and so on. A little over 50% live in 4-, 3-, 2- or 1-room HDB flats.At the risk of oversimplification, those who live in less expensive homes may be the ones feeling the economic anxiety and pessimism that the Edelman survey measures. They may struggle to compete in the workplace or academia, especially if they did not receive the inherited advantages of wealth or social capital that President Halimah spoke of. The elderly on fixed or no incomes have to grapple with rising food prices. Whereas others, the optimistic 36%, may feel that they can thrive in this very competitive society with high prices and expensive homes.In fact, poverty and social inequality ranked as the third big area of concern in a national survey done in 2020 by Ipsos, after jobs and healthcare. At this point, I declare my interest as the Chairman of a Singapore company that undertakes market research and consulting.Sir, when we have discussions like this, it is often pointed out that real wages are still growing. But the Edelman survey, plus a great deal of anecdotal experience from my conversations with Singaporeans in the Serangoon ward of Aljunied Group Representation Constituency (GRC) and East Coast GRC previously, suggest that this anxiety is very real. Many fear that the way food, house and other prices are rising, the way the job market is becoming more competitive, those with fewer advantages will truly struggle to build a tomorrow that is better than today.Also, we should recall that real wage data may mask some things. Real wages may appear to be rising but that may mask the fact that certain demographic groups may feel the pain of inflation more than others.Previously in the House, I have called for Consumer Price Index (CPI) data to be published by demographic group, for example, parents with young children or empty nesters, as inflation affects these groups differently. Also, within each income decile, there will be those who do less well than the median for that decile.And lastly, the Edelman survey shows that whatever the real wage growth data suggests, the thinking of many Singaporeans about the future reflects a lack of confidence that they can thrive going forward.This economic pessimism could be one reason for our globally low total fertility rate, or TFR. In the previous housing debate, I also cited academic evidence for a causal link between high home prices and low TFR in Singapore. If left to fester, such economic pessimism could lead to a brain drain as people leave for more liveable countries. If that happens, that may tend to create over-reliance on foreign manpower.We need to address this economic pessimism fundamentally, not only through ad hoc measures such as an additional grant here or an additional rebate there, helpful as that is. More far-reaching reforms are needed to make everyone believe that this society has their back. The WP has called for many such reforms in the past. In the interest of time, I shall not expand on these, but I shall refer to them. One, a national minimum wage. Two, a redundancy insurance scheme. This is something the WP has championed for some time and I was intrigued by Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong’s reference to some form of unemployment support. Three, seriously tackling the issue of poverty and breaking the poverty cycle. I have called for a war on poverty in this House. My hon friend Assoc Prof Jamus Lim has also weighed in on this topic yesterday, as have other WP MPs over the years. Four, reforming the Housing and Development Board (HDB) housing system to lower Build-To-Order (BTO) prices by revisiting the formula for land valuation as well as introducing various other reforms, as we argued in the recent housing debate. Five, revamping trades or vocational jobs to overhaul them for higher productivity, pay and conditions. I have spoken about this in the House several times.Lest anyone say that the trade-offs have not been explained, these ideas taken togethe,r will slow the rate of growth of reserves but will not draw down reserves. I believe slowing down the growth of reserves is wholly justified at this stage of our nation’s history, given the needs we have with an ageing population in a turbulent world and given the much larger size of reserves now versus GDP, as they were in the past. My WP colleagues and I have explained this repeatedly, on multiple platforms. We must invest to ensure a confident current generation, lest our fertility go so low that there will be few people in the generations to come.Sir, before I move on, I want to refer to Deputy Prime Minister Wong’s comment yesterday that the Opposition should offer concrete alternative policy ideas.We have been doing this. We offer alternative policies that differ substantively from the ideas of the PAP, for example, on slowing reserves growth to enhance liveability, social justice and social mobility and reducing BTO prices based on tweaks to the land valuation formula. The alternatives we have championed in Parliament, in our manifesto are too numerous for me to mention here. I only have 20 minutes. In fact, I only have less than five minutes left. We championed an expansive acute hospital bill insurance scheme and permanently delinking BTO from resale prices long before this was adopted by the PAP Government. We championed anti-discrimination legislation and redundancy insurance, policies that the PAP are now considering in some form. The Deputy Prime Minister and the PAP know this. They know it. Sir, I have a sense of déjà vu now, recalling how I was debating a similar issue about what the PAP said about our housing paper in this House just a few weeks ago. [Deputy Speaker (Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo) in the Chair]Mdm Deputy Speaker, let us be honest in our political debates. Honest. Not going for false but flashy soundbites that smear our opponents, that the media then viralise with huge headlines. I do not want my children to grow up in a post-truth society.Mdm Deputy Speaker, I come now to the third and last part of my speech, about the development of a Singapore model that can inspire the world.As I said in my maiden speech, we have got certain fundamentals right. The glass is half full. Let us fill in the other half with measures to enhance our active citizenry, civil society and engaged, rational politics.This thinking can extend to regional leadership in economic projects. Such projects can be designed to reflect Singaporean values of good corporate governance and efficiency, but also incorporating consultation and engagement with civil society and other stakeholders. And the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for such projects could advance goals like poverty alleviation, reflecting Singaporean values of egalitarianism and inclusivity.Singapore has positioned itself as a leader in economic openness, having the most free trade agreements (FTAs) in the region. But one of our distant competitors is putting a twist on this approach. The UAE’s diplomacy focuses on playing a supporting role to Saudi Arabia, Egypt and so on, who have much bigger populations and armies, even as the UAE positions itself as the business gateway to the Arab World and Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.But the UAE has taken this a step further. It invests in overseas assets with a very outsized investment in renewables. The scale of this is extremely large – just the renewables arm of one of their sovereign wealth funds have targeted 100 gigawatts of renewables at home and abroad by 2030, quadrupling the current commitment and being worth around US$100 billion. By comparison, Temasek-linked Sembcorp’s 2025 target is 10 gigawatts; Keppel’s is seven gigawatts.An example of UAE “dealplomacy” is where its government-owned renewables business, Masdar, committed to a 10-gigwatt mega-wind farm in Egypt in a deal on COP27’s sidelines, which would save Egypt $5 billion in annual gas costs and offset about 9% of its emissions. In comparison, Singapore has supported renewable energy companies’ expansion into the region and internationally, but largely on a commercial, non-diplomatic basis.Why green investments as the backbone of these regional leadership efforts? Because green energy is cheap, lasting, critical and has the potential to make a far-reaching impact.IRENA estimates that if Southeast Asia were to build enough renewables to cut energy-related carbon dioxide emissions, it could also save US$160 billion as well as $1.5 trillion in health and environmental costs related to fossil fuels by 2050. But to pull this off, $7 trillion in investment is needed from now till then.In 2018, I spoke in this House about the idea of Singapore leading a flagship project in the region on renewable energy or some such theme to serve multiple economic and diplomatic ends. Such projects need not be primarily government financed but can raise financing in capital markets globally. Leading and catalysing such a regional flagship project will help bolster —Mdm Deputy Speaker: Mr Perera, you have a minute. Please round up your speech. ',\n",
       " 'Yes, I am tracking the time. One minute. Leading and catalysing such a regional flagship project will help bolster Singapore’s economy and also Singapore’s soft power in the ASEAN region, a region which has a potentially important historical destiny, namely that of a bulwark and zone of buffering and balancing between the great powers of China and the West.And what if Singapore demonstrates how its traditional bureaucratic efficiency can be combined with policies that ensure openness, accountability and democratic ownership among an active citizenry? That could serve as a good example for this vital region that will inspire emulation and perhaps help form an ASEAN identity around such principles. [Applause.]Mdm Deputy Speaker: Minister Chan Chun Sing. ',\n",
       " 'Mdm Deputy Speaker, thank you very much. I just wish to make a point of clarification for Ms Sylvia Lim\\'s speech. I heard her saying that the Government says that, essentially, we say that people under 21 years old did not have the skills to vote. May I check, when did we say this?Because if I am right, I just checked the Hansard, on 24 February 2023 in my reply to Ms Sylvia Lim\\'s question. I said, \"If we look at the rights and responsibility of all our people from the ages of 16 until 21, there is a gradation of scale. At different ages they have different rights and different responsibilities.\" Mdm Deputy Speaker: Ms Sylvia Lim.',\n",
       " 'Mdm Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the Motion. As part of our Forward Singapore conversation, much has been discussed about refreshing our social compact.This has also been the central issue at this debate, including in the speeches of the President, Deputy Prime Minister Wong and various Members.Many have asked: what is a social compact? Others asked: what is our social compact?A social compact is simply our responsibilities towards one another; how we reward work and distribute the fruits of labour and success; and how we relate to and respect one another. So, three \"R\"s – our responsibilities towards one another; how we reward work and distribute the fruits of our success; and how we relate to and respect one another.Central to the Singapore social compact has been meritocracy. People are recognised based on merit and achievements. We aspire as a nation for all to progress through our abilities, rather than birth rights, family connections or inherited wealth. These principles have brought us this far. It has spurred our people to excel individually. It has allowed us to accomplish much collectively. Indeed, for a new country of immigrants, there did not and does not seem to be a better set of organising principles for people to operate within and excel. Many of our forefathers came to Singapore because this was a place that allowed them to realise their dreams, despite their starting circumstances and lack of connections.Many of us are also here today because of the opportunities afforded to us by this system of meritocracy. This includes Members from all sides of the House.Other systems, such as aristocracy, plutocracy and nepotism, serve the interests of the few, rather than of the many. These other systems would not have similarly motivated our people to aspire and strive, nor helped us to attract the best and brightest to commit their future to Singapore.While meritocracy has allowed us to avoid some of these pitfalls, it is now under stress worldwide. There are increasing questions if meritocracy is indeed fair. Or can it be fair, especially over the long term? The process is also questioned by some who are unhappy with the outcomes.To fix the problems, some real and some perceived, various countries have tried to fix the process in different ways. Some countries have tried affirmative action for the less privileged groups, by levelling the uneven playing field in resources and opportunities for the less privileged groups.It sounds fine, until we have to figure out who gets to decide who are the less privileged and what opportunities we should set aside for them. It becomes even more complicated when everyone feels relatively deprived or less privileged from their own perspectives.While meritocracy has generally worked well for Singapore so far, we also acknowledge that our system is not perfect.We must recognise that meritocracy, by itself, is not a panacea for all of our societal challenges. Let me list a few potential pitfalls; and suggest what we must do to keep our meritocracy sustainable and resilient.First, as the world and our society evolve, our needs are constantly changing. Indeed, our relevance and competitiveness as a country depend on our ability to evolve with the times.Hence, meritocracy based on any single, static and narrow metric for talent and ability, will not allow us to build a resilient society with a diversity of strengths to meet tomorrow\\'s challenges.As society matures, those who have succeeded under the previous and existing metrics, will tend to want to perpetuate the same set of yardsticks – sometimes, to preserve their personal interests and comfort; sometimes, they assume that what has worked will continue to work in a different future and do not think of alternatives that society may need going forward. We must not allow any single, static and narrow metric to define success which can easily cause our society to stagnate and become irrelevant.The second danger of meritocracy, beyond competing on a static and narrow metric, is to reward success based on fixed, defined, and pre-determined points in life and time. Once the determining test is conducted and the results are known, then it is as if the life trajectories of our people are fixed and become too difficult to change. This cannot be our society. People develop at different paces and demonstrate different abilities at different times. For society to allow everyone to do justice to their gifts, we must have a system of continuous meritocracy, where no single test or point in time determines the rest of one\\'s life. This continuous meritocracy must extend beyond the education system, throughout life.  Employers and society have as much a part to play to recognise the skills and talents of our people; and not fall into the trap of credentialism of using any single dated metric. We must ensure that there is porosity in the ways that people can earn their spurs, contribute throughout life and allow them to bounce back from setbacks.The third danger of meritocracy is stratification over time.It is natural and perhaps inevitable that the successful will tend to mix amongst themselves, creating exclusive social circles instead of sharing social capital. It is also human nature to want to pass on our wealth and privileges to our children, be it through the accumulation of assets, like investments and property, or through access to additional education resources, like tuition.But these natural tendencies risk creating an endowment effect in society. Access to opportunities and rewards could increasingly be determined not just by the merits of this generation, but the transfer of wealth and privileges from the previous generations.Meritocracy becomes harder and harder for the less privileged, as their relative start state falls further and further behind the privileged.We must not leave this unchecked, or this will progressively stratify society, undermining our cohesion and eroding our higher purpose to draw on the talents and capabilities from all in society, instead of the privileged few. The fourth danger of meritocracy is the misplaced belief that one\\'s success is attributed entirely to one\\'s talent and hard work, without acknowledging the role that society has played in enabling the person to succeed; the need for them to give back, uphold the system and strengthen our society; and the need to continually push back against the forces of social stratification.To keep our Singaporean meritocracy resilient and sustainable, this Government, together with our people, will focus on six key strategies.First, we value our people\\'s diverse abilities.We will continue to move away from evaluating our people\\'s diverse abilities by any single, static, and narrow metric – be it the PSLE results, grade-point averages, or whether they hold a degree or diploma.Take Full Subject-based Banding. With the implementation of Full Subject-based Banding next year, our education system will become more flexible and provide multiple pathways to cater to different learner profiles. Students will have the flexibility to pursue different subjects at different subject levels, which allows them to customise their learning in each subject to a pace suited for them, while developing other areas of interest. This, coupled with our plans to leverage educational technologies such as AI-enabled adaptive learning systems, will help to provide more customised learning experiences for all our students.We are also broadening the pathways in which students can access their education. With more opportunities for Direct School Admission and aptitude-based admissions, our students will be able to pursue studies based on their passion and aptitude rather than purely academic performance. We will continually review our admission policies to ensure that our schools remain open and accessible for students from diverse backgrounds while balancing other competing needs, such as preserving community ties and maintaining a variegated education landscape to cater to different students\\' needs.  We will press on with our efforts to develop 21st century competencies in all our students so that they can thrive amidst constant changes in our world. Our curriculum will continue to be refreshed regularly to meet our students\\' future needs. We will continue to emphasise important life skills and free up time and space for schools to strengthen learning dispositions and holistic development. This will allow our students to develop an empowering portfolio of skills that will serve them well whatever they end up doing, including adaptability, resilience and the ability to think critically and inventively. To these ends, we need the support of parents. As parents, we must welcome schools to have their unique value propositions. This can better cater to the diverse needs of our children and help them to realise their full potential. Hence, it is not necessary or meaningful for us to constantly compare why one school\\'s offering may be slightly different from another\\'s.  The more appropriate question is not \"Is this a good school?\" but \"Is this a good or appropriate school for my child?\"As parents, we must also not fall into the trap of allowing broader dimensions of merit to translate into greater pressure to chase down more and every yardstick to \"beat the crowd\". We must remember that broader dimensions of merit are meant to help our children fulfil their potential according to their diverse strengths and interests. This is not meant to provide more ways to compare our children with others in areas that are not suited for their strengths or interests.We must remember to teach our children that it is more important to surpass themselves throughout life than to surpass someone else in an examination.Second, we will continue to create more diverse education pathways to allow greater porosity throughout life.Building on efforts like Full Subject-Based Banding in MOE schools, our post-secondary and tertiary pathways will provide more flexibility to better support students\\' learning and progression.For example, polytechnic students will be able to spread out their learning if they intend to pursue side interests or need more time to build up a stronger academic foundation. ITE\\'s enhanced curricular structure will cater to a diverse range of learner profiles. Those who graduate with a Higher Nitec can look forward to further upgrading opportunities, such as the expanded offerings of ITE\\'s Work-Study Diplomas.Our publicly funded university degrees will also have a higher lifetime cohort participation rate so that more Singaporeans can look forward to obtaining a degree from our autonomous universities, not necessarily before starting work but at some point in their working lives. Third, we will invest in our people throughout life, not just in the first 15 years when they are with us in our schools, but also for the next 50 years beyond our schools. Our people will need to continually upskill and reskill across their lifetimes to evolve at their own speed, create new value and stay ahead of the competition. To support this, the Government has increased its investment in recent years in Continuing Education and Training (CET), including through the national SkillsFuture movement. We will not stop here. We will intensify our efforts to help our people stay relevant and competitive.As part of the Forward Singapore exercise, we will announce more details in due course on how we intend to help our workforce to upskill and remain relevant throughout life.  Amongst the various ideas are more targeted training support for mid-career workers, including SkillsFuture Credit top-ups and how we make training more accessible for working adults with competing commitments and responsibilities.But the Government\\'s efforts alone will not be enough. We will need the partnership of industry, the innovation of institutions and the growth mindset of individuals.Industries cannot wait passively for the perfect worker to be developed for them. They must be active partners in shaping students\\' interests and skillsets even before they enter the workforce. Hence, I welcome more companies to partner our schools in our Applied Learning Programmes.  After that, industries must also be prepared to invest the time and resources to support our workers to upskill continually.  I can understand the challenges for industries to commit to the training of our workers, especially in uncertain times. But if we do not grow our own timber collectively, we will all be fighting over a stagnant talent and skills pool.The Public Service, as an employer, will lead by example in supporting our workers to upskill continually.Our IHLs will continue to innovate and enhance their programme offerings, including through work-study programmes and stackable modules that may be more suitable for mid-career Singaporeans who wish to upgrade their skills. At the same time, our people will need to develop a growth mindset and passion for lifelong learning to make full use of these opportunities.We will need this whole-of-society effort to enable our people to stay relevant and our industries to stay competitive in an ever more challenging environment.Fourth, not only must we respect a variety of professions, we must also fairly reward and remunerate the \"heart\" and \"hand\" work that is commensurate with the \"head\" work. Our society needs all these roles to complement one another to function well.As an example, MOE is reviewing the remuneration and career progression pathways in the Special Education sector to strengthen the professional development of our special needs educators and improve the quality of services to better support students with special education needs.  We must ensure that our special needs educators who serve in diverse and demanding environments are recognised and appreciated for their efforts and contributions and for the challenging work that they do. We must also ensure that our special needs professionals have professional development opportunities, just like mainstream MOE teachers.Indeed, there should be much more cross-pollination of ideas and mutual support between the mainstream and special needs educator fraternity and, similarly, within the special needs education sector.  I hope to have the support of all Singaporeans for us to move in this direction.MOE and MSF will work closely with all our social service agencies to achieve this vision for the benefit of our special needs professionals and our special needs community. We will need to work together. We can achieve more collectively to better take care of the professionals in this sector instead of just thinking of optimising individually in respective institutions.Beyond MOE, other workplaces that involve \"hand\" and \"heart\" work, including those in the essential services sectors, also need to play their part. They need to hire, train and reward workers fairly based on skills and competencies. But we all know that this may translate into higher costs for some services provided by our fellow Singaporeans, which our society must be willing to accept and support. Otherwise, no matter how much we broaden the definitions of merit in our school system, none of it will ultimately work because it does not translate into tangible differences in earnings and at the workplace.Fifth, as a society, we must always do more for those with less to uplift the less privileged. This has been and this will continue to be the guiding principle behind this Government\\'s policies.That is why we set up the Uplifting Pupils in Life and Inspiring Families Taskforce (UPLIFT) to rally the community to partner our schools in helping students from disadvantaged backgrounds to progress educationally and to achieve their full potential. That is also why we have a progressive tax system to contribute to the running of such initiatives.Everyone bears part of the responsibility, but those with more, bear more, and those with less, get more.This is also why we want to do more for the less privileged in terms of housing, retirement adequacy, healthcare and many other areas. This helps us to ensure that the gaps in society are not too stark, opening us up to the politics of envy and threatening the harmony of our society. It also helps us to avoid the need for affirmative action to decide who should or should not be given opportunities based on who they are rather than what they can do and what they can be.However, we must never degenerate into a system where everyone thinks they deserve more relative to others. Indeed, I see this as one of our major challenges. I fear a day when we constantly feel a sense of relative deprivation from seeing someone else getting more help than us instead of feeling a sense of gratitude at being helped or feeling a sense of satisfaction at being able to help someone else. We will then lose our social cohesion to the politics of envy.  Perhaps, we need to regularly remind ourselves that it is more blessed to give than if we are to just receive. As the Chinese say – 施比受更为有福. The ultimate measure of our success as a society is not how many people we can help because they are unable to keep up, but how few people we need to help because we have enabled them to thrive. A sustainable and resilient meritocracy is one where the largest possible number of people are enabled to achieve and contribute to take care of the fewest number possible who are unable to achieve as much. The ultimate measure of our success as a society is not how many people we can help because they are unable to keep up but how few people we need to help because we have enabled them to thrive.Sixth, we need to imbue the right values in all our people from young so that they can grow to become individuals who are willing to give back to society and create more opportunities for others.All of us must recognise that our individual success is never just due to our own abilities and hard work, that without the opportunities that society provided us and the help from others along the way, we may not be where we are here today. So, even as we celebrate and enjoy the fruits of our own labour, we must not forget to give back to society and others around us, to share the networks and ties that have helped us so that others may also similarly benefit from the opportunities and access.Today, our schools already facilitate this sharing of social capital across different schools. Through cluster-based programmes like co-curricular activities, Values in Action initiatives and other holistic development programmes, students from different schools can come together, get to know one another, learn how to communicate and collaborate with one another and form friendships that go beyond their own schools.Going forward, we will further strengthen our school cluster system to enable better pooling and sharing of resources and allow more students to benefit from wider networks and build their social capital. We can do more of these through co-curricular activities, Values in Action programmes and even selected curriculum. We encourage everyone in society to partner us in these efforts. Contribute your time and talent, beyond treasures. Show our students the way forward and help to nurture a more giving generation in time to come. Share your networks and opportunities with the next generation of students, not just in your alma mater but in other schools as well, to help them succeed like you did.I, therefore, call on the alumni of the more established schools to come forward, to step forward, to join hands with us, to contribute to the wider community of schools so that we can all progress together, faster and better.This is something that all of us who have gone through the system and succeeded can and should do.Some may ask – what can I contribute if I am not as successful? If I did not come from a school with a more illustrious history? If I do not earn a big salary, wear expensive clothes, live in a big house or drive a fancy car? My answer is simply this – those material achievements are not the only yardsticks of success nor should they define our ability to contribute. Neither should they determine the respect and dignity that one deserves.  Instead, we must define success by how much we contribute to others and the greater good and not just how much we achieve for ourselves. We should have the courage to step up and say, \"I can always contribute something, according to my abilities, regardless of where I am in life\". And everyone can say that and can do something about that. I look forward to the day when our society defines success not just by one’s achievements, but more importantly by one’s contributions. When a true son and daughter of Singapore who earns and deserves our respect is one whose contributions not only commensurate with his or her achievements, but also one who contributes to the best of his or her abilities. Mdm Deputy Speaker, let me conclude. In an increasingly volatile and uncertain environment, we need to avoid over-structuring our system and processes to give our people a false sense of security while eroding their development to handle an uncertain and untidy world. Instead, we must provide multiple pathways with diverse metrics of success while equipping our people with the life skills they need to thrive in the 21st century, to allow our people to chart their own way forward according to their own strengths and talents.In an increasingly competitive world, we can easily fall into the trap of always looking at the right side of the bell curve and feeling eternally inadequate. Instead, we must remind ourselves of our gifts and responsibilities to help those who are less privileged than us.In an increasingly unequal and uncertain world, we need to strengthen our sense of solidarity and collective assurance without eroding the individual’s responsibility and sense of agency. We must come together as individuals, as partners, as employers and as a community to celebrate diverse forms of abilities and contributions, to recognise and respect the dignity of those who contribute in different ways to society, to help everyone upskill continually and move up the ladder throughout our lifetimes and to give back to society and others who have helped us along the way.Finally, the Singapore Story is a living story. Do not be taken by hubris to think that we have \"arrived\" or can ever \"arrive\" and need not evolve or improve anymore. We understand the merits of our system and how far it has helped us to come this far as a society by unleashing our potential as individuals. Yet, we are not complacent to think that we can ever stop improving our system. Any living system that does not grow will wither.The mark of our success is not just how well we enable this generation to achieve success but how well we establish the conditions for the next generation to be even more successful than us. Only so will we be able to continuously write new chapters of the Singapore Story.There may never be a perfect system to develop all the perfect students or workers for our societal needs. But we can all contribute our part to build a better or less imperfect system to continually inspire our people and all who believe in our dream to build a resilient and sustainable meritocratic system to bring out the best from all, to be a beacon of cohesion with unity of purpose in a troubled world, a society with a sense of collective responsibility towards one another, a society with respect for diverse abilities, a society that rewards hard work and talent, a society that recognises contributions beyond achievements, a society with gratitude for our blessings to want to do good for all beyond ourselves.And, finally, a nation confident to defy the odds of history to survive and thrive beyond SG100.

       " 'Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. In fact, I had raised my hand with Deputy Speaker because I also went back to check and I realised that my recollection of the response was not quite accurate. So, I accept what Minister has said – he did not say that the people between 18 and 21 did not have the skillsets to vote, but what he said was that there is a different rights and responsibilities for people between 16 and 21.But I believe the question still remains, as to whether those between 18 and 21 should be empowered to vote. I apologise for recollecting wrongly.Mdm Deputy Speaker: Minister Chan. ',\n",
       " 'I thank Ms Lim for the clarification. Indeed, we have not said that.Mdm Deputy Speaker: Mr Patrick Tay. ',\n",
       " \"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the Motion to thank Mdm President for her address at the Opening of the second session of the 14th Parliament.  Mdm President has reiterated the importance of ensuring a broader and more open meritocracy that works well for all Singaporeans; one in which no one feels left behind. Whether it is in education or employment, the Government has made positive and concerted efforts to promote meritocracy.  As a labour MP, I have been lobbying in the past years against discrimination and have been part of the efforts in the Tripartite Committee on Workplace Fairness to uphold the principles of fair and merit-based employment in Singapore. The interim report and update was recently issued and I look forward to seeing this piece of legislation next year when it is introduced in Parliament.The issue of age discrimination and ageism as highlighted by hon Member Sylvia Lim is one area which will be addressed in this piece of legislation. In the education front, I can see the efforts at levelling the playing field and providing opportunities for all to maximise their full potential in the entire learning continuum from mainstream to adult education and continuing education and training both in and outside of employment.  Yesterday, the WP through hon Member Gerald Giam proposed through-train schools for the first 10 years. This is not a new idea, as my fellow MOE Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) member and former Chair, hon Member Denise Phua, has suggested almost a decade ago and on different occasions. MOE during the Committee of Supply had explained considerations to right-site our students according to their learning needs and the associated challenges of implementation that we must carefully consider. There are also those who want to retain the PSLE and want to have a choice of the secondary school they want to enter at some interval. Likewise, with subject-based banding, to be rolled out across all secondary schools in due course, will allow students to discover and pursue their passions and interests while deepening their strengths and abilities, and have a more structured and less painful process for learning. We do not want an arms race or more stress due to examinations. We also do not want to cram children with even more content as character and values are equally, if not more, important. I am glad we have made significant changes to the education system and must continue to do so to improve. I therefore agree and support what Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong mentioned in his speech yesterday on our refreshed meritocracy, which is a continuous one with learning opportunities, milestones, ladders at multiple junctures through this learning continuum. It therefore holds true that it remains a treadmill journey and we need to constantly evolve and find new and innovative ways to imbue the love for learning in everyone, foster a lifelong learning culture and ensure our people stay ready, relevant and resilient – ready to do better, relevant to move forward in life and resilient to try again.In my recent contribution to ETHOS, a publication of the Civil Service College, I reiterated the importance of adopting a mindset of lifelong learning to address the issue of skills mismatch. SkillsFuture, the national movement to provide Singaporeans with the opportunities to develop their fullest potential throughout life regardless of their starting points, is Singapore's initiative towards inculcating that mindset and embedding it within our culture.We have already seen how SkillsFuture has paid off for businesses. Results from a study conducted by SkillsFuture Singapore and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) showed that companies which tap on SkillsFuture to fund eligible training expenses report revenue benefits and higher productivity. Our research in the Labour Movement also revealed that majority of business leaders have observed positive changes in their workers post-training, such as higher performance at work and being able to take on new job responsibilities. These findings are promising, and we certainly hope that all businesses will provide their workers that access to quality continuing education and training (CET) and upgrading opportunities. The Labour Movement will continue its work in advocating that employers provide adequate training support for their workers so that they may tap on opportunities that arise in the new economy and ensure a just transition for all.However, I feel we can do more for the individual Singaporean in ensuring that this system that supports lifelong learning works for them too. The vision to strengthen our SkillsFuture ecosystem such that everyone is enabled to do significant skills reboot during their working lives is one that I firmly believe in.Madam President shared that such a skills reboot would help to keep Singaporeans employable or transit across to jobs in new areas of growth. I wholeheartedly agree with this.  What the entire SkillsFuture programme does is that it provides us access to a toolbox. Call it a CET toolbox – a collection of educational courses and training programmes that are meant to support and equip us on this journey of lifelong learning, enabling us to accomplish skills mastery and even second-skilling ourselves. Just like the SkillsFuture Credit which arms every Singaporean citizen from the age of 25 with this toolbox. However, not all of them open this toolbox, much less use it.  Anecdotally, through my engagements with workers as well as with residents, this could be attributed to two reasons. First, there are just too many options for training programmes out there. Second, there is a perceived lack of guarantee that undergoing training would result in tangible outcomes for the individual's career in terms of wages and progression. Returning to my toolbox analogy, what this means is that: first, there are just too many tools in our toolbox, leading to confusion; and two, a lack of knowledge on how using a certain tool or a combination of tools would help us accomplish certain tasks, revealing a lack of clarity or information asymmetry.  The next question, then, is a straightforward one – how can we help Singaporeans navigate these tools, cut through the analysis paralysis, resolve the paradox of choice and have the confidence that the utilisation of these tools would empower them with the means to fix a leaky pipe, replace a light switch or assemble a table and become the version of the skilled tradesperson that they have always aspired to be? In other words, how can we tighten the nuts and bolts of our SkillsFuture ecosystem to generate outcomes that will ultimately be beneficial for Singaporeans and their careers and, eventually, our economy?  Our workforce is made up of workers of varied profiles and it is imperative that we adopt a more targeted lifelong learning strategy for different worker segments to ensure that everyone has fair access to opportunities, a level playing field for jobs, while, at the same time, balancing companies' manpower needs in the immediate and longer term to achieve equitable outcomes. We have skills frameworks and annual reports on skills in demand which are very instructive and useful. But I opine that a more individualised and speed to market approach is needed so that time and resources spent on training and skills upgrading lead to clear outcomes in terms of wages and career progression and ensure every worker stays employed and employable.  There is a way to enable this targeted lifelong learning strategy by tapping on the expertise of career coaches and counsellors. Professional, industry-accredited career coaches and counsellors work with us to explore our strengths and weaknesses, build confidence and chart our career paths. They are invaluable help and support throughout our careers. Unfortunately, such individualised career services are either availed to the high potential segments of a company, only in large organisations and multinational corporations (MNCs), or those who are retrenched or unemployed. In the same vein, there is a lack of industry-led accreditation of career coaches and coaching in Singapore.For our young fresh graduates, mid-careerists in the throes of a mid-life or mid-career crisis and vulnerable segments, such as those who are not so young as well as inmates and ex-offenders – having a career coach to mentor them, to help them navigate the journey of upskilling and retraining with them can make a world of difference. And as we navigate a skills and employment landscape that is increasingly complex, the assistance and guidance by a career coach is becoming more of a necessity than a luxury. Therefore, I propose that there be industry-led accreditation of career coaches and counsellors and expanding SkillsFuture Credit utilisation to include the engaging of professional career coaches and counsellors. The advice and guidance rendered by the career coach would complement what SkillsFuture, in its existing form, already offers. It may even reduce or resolve the psychological barriers to training and ensure all Singaporeans that they have equal chances and opportunities at all stages to develop their skills. Whether they are in the midst of a life transition, or just looking to upskill, Singaporeans can look towards SkillsFuture as providing the full suite of services that would support them in that journey. Toolbox in hand, Singaporeans can be confident that there is a master tradesman by their side to guide them in the effective use of tools to achieve skills mastery.Taking a longer-term view, the SkillsFuture initiative could then be what reduces the skills and jobs mismatch, thereby reducing under-employment and skills shortages. It would maximise our intended structural outcomes in progressing the development of our people and economy, while ensuring that Singaporeans continue to have access to opportunities – regardless of their life stage – to help them find their true north and realise their full potential. On a final note, I have previously lobbied in this House on many occasions in the past decade, the possibility of monetary support for those unemployed to help them tide over the difficult period before finding and landing the next job. The idea has been fleshed out in our joint NTUC-SNEF PME Taskforce report recommendations and again during our recent #EveryWorkermatters conversations. All workers, including PMEs, especially those in their 40s and 50s, are visibly concerned and anxious over skills obsolescence and unemployment. In this respect, I welcome Madam President's mention and Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's speech yesterday which alluded that the Government would study how we will extend support beyond the pandemic – well, similar to the COVID‐19 Recovery Grant and the SGUnited Jobs and Skills programme, to watch our backs and help our workers tide over unemployment and get re-employed again.Madam Deputy Speaker, with that, I support the Motion of Thanks to the President.Mdm Deputy Speaker: Mr Gerald Giam.\",\n",
       " 'Thank you, Mdm Chair. I note that Mr Patrick Tay said that the 10-year through-train-school idea is not new. Ms Denise Phua proposed it more than a decade ago. I have not had the chance to check the Hansard yet. But be that as it may and in the interest of arriving at the best policies for Singaporeans, regardless of who raised it first, do Mr Patrick Tay and Ms Phua agree that the 10-year through-train programme from Primary 1 to Secondary 4 would be a helpful option for parents who want their children to bypass the PSLE?Mdm Deputy Speaker: Mr Patrick Tay.',\n",
       " \"If I may give a quick response to the hon Member Gerald Giam, I think there are constraints, and I think it was highlighted again in my speech. I mentioned about MOE's response to this idea and suggestion by the hon Member Denise Phua. I think there are constraints because you are looking at the whole continuum from primary to secondary school. As of today, the teachers and staff already have very exacting requirements and demands on their time and resources. So, doing this will mean dedicating even more resources, and even stretching workers in this space and the entire education ecosystem. This requires serious consideration and, therefore, it is something we need to think carefully before we move on to the step.Mdm Deputy Speaker: Ms Denise Phua.\",\n",
       " \"Thank you, Madam. In response to hon Member Gerald Giam's question, I still think that there is potential good pathway to do away with the PSLE and have a pilot of an integrated 10-year programme. But I also acknowledge the challenges that Education Minister Chan Chun Seng mentioned in this year's Committee of Supply (COS). So, the debate should not be on just having or not having that pathway, but really to go on to the next level, perhaps in the Forward Singapore conversations.As to what it will take to create a pathway like this, the challenges, and to solve some of the root issues that the ground faces and will be having. So, I think the debate is not just to have or not to have – that is like a 10-year-old debate, whether to have or not to have – but really to go on to the next level. What does it take? Why it should happen or why should it not happen? And what kind of resources? What contraints will come in if we choose that pathway? I do support that potential pathway still.Mdm Deputy Speaker: Ms Janet Ang.\",\n",
       " 'Mdm Deputy Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak on the Motion put up by hon Member of Parliament, Mr Murali Pillai. I join the hon Member to express gratitude to the President for her Address.Mdm President\\'s speech on behalf of the Government was uplifting and covered a lot of ground and I thank her for inspiring all of us to run the next lap as one Singapore amidst an increasingly complex world. We have come a long way since gaining Independence and achieved what many would consider an economic miracle. The Economic Intelligence Unit recently just ranked Singapore for the 15th consecutive year as the world\\'s best business environment over the next five years. Trust in Government, as measured by Edelman, remains consistently high and we should not take that for granted. Our political maturity has also come of age with this Parliament having its first Leader of the Opposition appointed by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.However, all of us need to acknowledge that Singapore is at a point of inflexion. We have a declining birthrate since 2017. And, like many of the advanced economies, we are in the middle of a silver tsunami. To keep our economy vibrant and to support the needs of our ageing population, Singapore needs a large pool of foreign complementary workforce. Hence, the foreign residents today constitute 38% of the labour force and represent 27% of all residents in Singapore. Singaporeans are faced with a dilemma of accepting this reality and creating a welcoming culture of integrating our foreign guest workers into our communities, or, allowing the continued tight labour situation to (a) negatively impact our service quality and the Singapore brand; (b) cause the burnout of our workforce due to their having to double-up for the shortage of labour; and (c) limiting our companies\\' growth opportunities, just to name a few. I would like to call Members\\' attention to a Straits Times article on 13 April with the headline: SBF calls for foreign worker measures to be eased as workload on frontliners piles up.  Singapore is, indeed, at a point of inflexion. It is timely that the whole of Government (WOG) has engaged Singaporeans in the Forward SG exercise led by Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong and the 4G leaders as a start to the refresh of our social compact. I salute the 14,000 Singaporeans from civil society and businesses who have stepped forward to co-create with the Government in re-imagining what success for Singapore 2.0 could look like. I attended a couple of the sessions myself and I can feel the love by so many of our Singaporeans for our country. Most heartening for me to know is that the affirmation that Singaporeans wish to hold intact the core values that we cherish as Singaporeans, that is, fairness, inclusivity, mutual support and the desire to give back to society. In her address, Mdm President spoke about the need for a broader and more open meritocracy that will work well for all Singaporeans. What would this Singapore-style meritocracy look like? Now, Collins Dictionary defines meritocracy as a society or social system in which people get status or rewards because of what they achieve, rather than because of their wealth or social status. Hence, the idea behind meritocracy is that the most talented and hardworking individuals should be given opportunities to succeed, regardless of their background or social class or their gender. Many positive outcomes of meritocracy have been realised: (a) top of the list is social mobility and many amongst us can stand to be counted as beneficiaries; (b) another positive outcome is that meritocracy promotes a more efficient and effective workforce as individuals are rewarded for their achievements and their hard work; and (c) meritocracy is largely seen as a fair system, thus promoting justice and equality. That said, there are also pitfalls to meritocracy. Meritocracy assumes equal access to all opportunities by everyone. And this is not always the case since those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds may not have the same resources or access and that can limit their chances of success. Two, meritocracy can be limited by how we define merit. In Singapore\\'s case, merit has been closely associated with paper qualifications and, hence, the phenomenon of the \"paper chase\". The narrow definition of merit to paper qualifications does not consider other qualities which, in fact, are competencies needed for the 21st century workforce, and these qualities include EQ, creativity, ability to communicate with influence or even craftsmanship and other non-traditional skills. Most of our employers in Singapore recruit, pay, promote and advance their employees based only on paper qualification primarily. Three, meritocracy can also create social division as those who are successful may attribute their success as solely due to their own merit rather than recognising the role of their family, the larger environment and society that has enabled and empowered them to be successful. This individualism mindset will, over time, erode the values of our society.Responding to Mdm President\\'s call to action for a rethink of the approach to education and to work so as to avoid the pitfalls of meritocracy as it is today, I would like to start the dialogue along these two aspects and offer some \"food for thought\" along the way. First, let us re-imagine meritocracy in education and I will raise three themes.First and foremost, we need to go back to basics and remind everyone in the system, embracing the dignity of the child and igniting in every child the joy of learning need to be central in any education system and believed in by all stakeholders – parents, educators/teachers, principals, policy-makers and society.Singapore does a reasonably good job in this regard and our educators deserve a big kudos for all they do for our children. How we were able to keep our children in school throughout most part of COVID-19 with teachers having to pivot to provide hybrid learning, is a case in point. The child is certainly central to our educators in Singapore.Next, I am heartened to see that increasingly so, more attention and resources are being given to children with special needs.For youths whose circumstances are challenged, the Government is enabling more social services agencies to provide the appropriate care from preventive to developmental, to rehabilitative.And community initiatives, like Yellow Ribbon, to give youths who have made bad choices in their lives, a second chance, is to be applauded.And the Government\\'s commitment to KidSTART and other programmes which help to uplift the children in the lower-income households and give them an equal chance early in life to participate on a level playing field is the absolute right thing to do.And for older students who may need extra help but cannot afford tuition, I would like to propose that MOE invest in some kind of after-school \"study halls\" facilitated by teachers and student ambassadors to help these students with their revision, homework and preparation for examinations. These initiatives will go a long way to narrow unequal access to resources and in so doing, facilitate social mobility.Three, the biggest challenge lies in changing mindsets. Meritocracy inevitably drives individual achievements and that is how the individualism mindset gets ingrained. To break the individualism mindset, a few things need to be reset. First, expectations need to be reset for both the teachers, the principals, the school system and the parents from focusing on grades to emphasising the dignity of the child, developing in the child the joy of learning and inculcating in the child the values of fairness, inclusivity, mutual support and the desire to give back to society. I submit to you that the adults need to walk-the-talk and role model the way forward for the students. So, dialogue and alignment amongst the stakeholders would necessarily be the first step. Two, teach our students that \"we are all in this together\". For this, perhaps, we can take a page from the late Nelson Mandela, and I quote, \"In Africa there is a concept known as \\'ubuntu\\' – the profound sense that we are human only through the humanity of others; that if we are to accomplish anything in this world, it will in equal measure be due to the work and achievement of others.\"Ubuntu is the philosophy of \"I am because we are\". As Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said yesterday, let our language be \"more of us and we and less of I and me\".Three, rewards motivate behaviour. The next step is to review the rewards system across the board. How are the teachers evaluated and rewarded? Are the students rewarded based on academic achievements primarily or behaviours of their values in action? How are parents engaged in the process to fulfill the common purpose of educating their child? Are students encouraged to share their knowledge and their skills with classmates who may need help?Rewards motivate behaviour. We cannot ask the educators to deliver one thing, but measure and pay them on something else. Likewise, for the students, how will their behaviours be rewarded, both in terms of the way they are graded as well as the way they will qualify for admission to higher levels of education?And so, I come to the next point. Specifically, admission criteria for students to progress can afford a rethink. How do we reward team spirit and team behaviour and perhaps penalise negative individualistic behaviours when crafting admission criteria? While we do want to develop our students to their best potential and have them be the Edusave Awards for Achievement, Good LEadership and Service (EAGLES) and soar, we ought to take a lesson from nature as even eagles in the sky fly in formation and take turns to be at the head of the \"V\". This formation helps them to fly longer distances. Perhaps, MOE and the schools and the parents might take this lesson on board and rethink the criteria used for rewarding students EAGLES. Five, rethink Government scholarships. I have heard stories of how smart students attain Singapore Government\\'s prestigious scholarships only to break bond and worse still, the intention to do that was already there even at the point of application. The Government might want to rethink the purpose of Government scholarships and perhaps consider giving more scholarships to students who both have merit and financial need. The Public Service Commission (PSC) may also want to review the penalties for persons breaking bond and make them punitive enough, likened to defaulting their National Service (NS) commitments, so as to incentivise the right behaviours and values.Breaking bond is a crime as you rob a fellow Singaporean from the opportunity to access the education and the experience that the scholarship provides.Of course, there may be some scholarships which are in recognition of one\\'s achievements. For such scholarships, perhaps, the Government can consider not imposing a bond but instead other forms of paying it forward.Another recommendation I have is for Government to send their scholars to serve their bond in local small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). This will spread out the talent to our local industry and, at the same time, these smartest of the smartest of Singaporeans will have a better understanding of issues on the ground and be better policy-makers when they return to the Public Service. Six, teachers play a significant role in all of this. The challenge of teachers is time. How can we help teachers by having them do less administrative work so they have more student encounters? How can we help to unburden their stress and keep their mental wellness in glowing condition? A kind word, a thank you, a please, a smile from the students and from parents would mean so much. And I would like to add that teacher-student interactions play a big part in educating the child. As we have falling enrolments due to fewer babies born each year, one proposal that I hope MOE can consider and I heard it in the House just now as well, is to bring down class sizes to less than 30 students per class. This will really help enhance teacher-student interactions. Seven, it takes a village to raise a child. Can the Government consider giving tax rebates to singles, the aunts and the uncles, who sponsor their nieces or nephews for their continuous education or tuition, in the same way like deductions for foreign domestic helpers in the tax form? Let me now transition from education to the workplace. Unlike the past, our students today face constant disruptions. What they have learnt in the first 25 years will need to be constantly upskilled and reskilled to stay relevant to the industry and the workplace. Singapore\\'s SkillsFuture is a brilliant and strategic vision. Its implementation will go a long way toward changing the view of meritocracy earned at point of graduation, to meritocracy earned over a lifetime. So, let us re-imagine meritocracy in the workplace.Just as MOE has developed multiple pathways for success, there should be multiple pathways for success in the industry.Allow me to focus my attention on the 60% of each year\\'s cohort of students who attend the Institute of Education (ITE) and/or polytechnics. The industry has a big part to play to help themselves as this is the pipeline of their workforce. Over the years, the polytechnics and ITE have stepped up engagement with industry and in many instances, imbedded industry into the curriculum. This is very important to ensure that the students are skills-ready and job-ready when they leave the system.Today, almost all students have the opportunities to do internships and attachments with companies as part of their polytechnic/ITE education.I think that more can be done to incentivise companies to hire our polytechnic/ITE students as apprentices, even before graduation, and for the companies\\' on-the-job training to be certified as stackable modules toward the diploma course which the students are pursuing, or even toward professional qualifications later on. MOE\\'s Work-Study Programme has been designed to facilitate such a pathway. Singapore Polytechnic\\'s Industry Now Curriculum has imbedded such elements. Outcomes have been positive. But we need more companies to come on board.This is where I see SGUnited Jobs and Skills which was effectively applied during COVID-19, can pivot to incentivise companies to employ our polytechnic/ITE students as apprentices and progress them to full-time jobs after graduation. The target group should be the polytechnic/ITE students who are unlikely to take the university route right after attaining their diplomas. So, we can be more targeted.Next, pay for skills, pay for value. In Singapore, I said earlier, most employers still hire and pay by qualifications and not by skills and value. I would advocate once again that SGUnited Jobs and Skills may be leveraged to target certain jobs which we want to have more Singaporeans in the roles but whose compensation package is currently not appealing for the Singaporeans to be excited to step in and companies need to be weaned off supposedly cheaper foreign labour. The target jobs ought to be aligned with MTI\\'s Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) so that the support and incentives can be more targeted.MTI\\'s Accelerated Pathways for Technicians and Assistant Engineers grant to support manufacturing companies in training and hiring ITE graduates for critical technical roles is a good case in point. We should replicate that – fast.Next, Government to lead the way. Between the Public Service, the Temasek-linked companies and the Government-linked companies, they hire a sizeable percentage of Singaporean workforce. So, I hope that they can lead the way from all the points that I have mentioned and start now. Many of our SMEs do not have the same access to capital, tools, networks and leadership. How can we incentivise our MNCs and large local enterprises (LLEs) to bring along our SMEs who are the vulnerable community in the business world in their value chain and, in so doing, intervene to avoid the pitfall of meritocracy which SMEs may be disadvantaged? Government procurement, if open to SMEs directly or via the value chain, will certainly help minimise the pitfalls of meritocracy as well. In conclusion, my hope is for our Singapore style of meritocracy to be one which values the dignity of every person, no matter their abilities or achievements, upholds the spirit of community that is as Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong calls it, more about the we and us and less about the I and me, empowers attitudes of always learning and collaborating, embraces a culture of care and dialogue, compassion and giving, inspires each one to strive for excellence together for the common good and creates an economy that is at the service of society where no one is left behind. I am confident that as One Singapore, we can make every tomorrow better than today. Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Motion. Mdm Deputy Speaker: Mr Leong Mun Wai.',\n",
       " 'Mdm Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the Motion thanking the President for her Address.The President\\'s Address points to the urgent need to refresh our social compact. This includes helping Singaporeans with more job support, strengthening the social safety nets, broadening the definition of meritocracy and promoting a strong sense of shared identity where every Singaporean feels that they have a stake in our country. These are noble aspirations which the Progress Singapore Party (PSP) strongly supports. However, to refresh or to redefine our social compact, PSP thinks that we need to first rethink fundamentally some of the more important policies on jobs, public housing, education and work and ultimately, what it means to be Singaporean.PSP has vigorously debated the Government on some of these issues, especially jobs and public housing in the past three years. Ms Hazel Poa and I had demonstrated what PSP, as a responsible Opposition party, will do to allow the voices of Singaporeans be heard.Among many other actions, we have asked more than 300 Parliamentary Questions, tabled two full Motions on jobs and public housing and three Adjournment Motions questioning vaccination-differentiated measures, public expenditures on the Sports Hub and SPH Media Trust and the Selective En Bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3. We have proposed serious alternative policies as a responsible Opposition party does. But regrettably, the Government does not generally seem to be prepared to consider our proposals seriously.The Deputy Prime Minister\\'s message yesterday confirms that one more time.Based on our debates with the Ministers, we believe that the policy changes advanced by the Government are inadequate to address the problems on hand. For example, the job security of Singaporeans and the surging HDB prices.Notwithstanding that, PSP is committed to work with the Government and all political parties as one Singapore team to empower our people, renew our social compact and secure a brighter future for ourselves and our children.From my very first speech as a Non-constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) in this Parliament, I have raised the concerns of Singaporeans who believe that the current socioeconomic policies are not working for them.Many Singaporeans are very concerned that the benefits of job growth and economic growth are mainly accruing to the foreign workforce in Singapore rather than Singaporean workers, even though our workers are well educated, well skilled and hardworking.We raised the widespread anxiety experienced by Singaporeans regarding their jobs and livelihoods during the debate on our foreign talent policy in September 2021. Regrettably, during that debate, instead of answering our questions directly and allowing the debate to focus on the more substantial issues, the Government tried to paint the PSP as a xenophobic, nativist and even racist political party. We categorically reject such allegations.The PSP has always maintained that for Singapore to achieve greater economic success, we will always need the right foreign talent to complement a Singaporean Core. We welcome the right foreign talent. However, when the quality, number and concentration of Work Pass holders affect the job security of Singaporeans, we must speak out. Singapore is a global city state. Unlike the Americans in New York or the Chinese in Shanghai, our countrymen have nowhere else to go if they cannot afford the cost of living or are displaced from their professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMET) jobs. There is no hinterland for these Singaporeans to retreat to. They will have to leave Singapore and go to another country. We must treasure our citizens and cannot let this happen.That is why over the last three years, I have continued to ask so many questions and focused so many of my speeches on our foreign manpower policy, the wage and employment situation of Singaporeans and workplace discrimination.Some of the specific policies that we have proposed in the last session of this Parliament include an Employment Pass (EP) levy of $1,200 per month, increasing the qualifying salaries for EP and Special Pass (SP) holders in stages over three years to $10,000 and $4,500 respectively; and to implement diversity quotas that limit the total percentage of a company\\'s workforce from any given nationality.These are rational and constructive policy alternatives to level the playing field for Singaporeans. They are not meant to close our doors to foreign talents or target any nationality or race.We have merely sought to advance the interest of our Singaporean workers and to give voice to their persistent anxieties and concerns over our immigration policy and their livelihoods. It is dangerous for the Government to misconstrue our concerns as being motivated by nativism, xenophobia and racism.In this session of Parliament, let us live up to the President\\'s exhortation last week – for us to have constructive, respectful and responsible political debates that are based on facts and sound analysis. At the end of the day, we are all doing our best for Singaporeans. And a Parliament that is a fair arena for all parties is one that will earn further respect from its people.In the last session of Parliament, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has introduced many policy initiatives under the leadership of Minister Dr Tan See Leng such as the new workplace fairness legislation, the Complementarity Assessment Framework (COMPASS) and an increase in minimum EP qualifying salaries. However, the many exemptions granted undermine the effectiveness of these policies as the MOM is given a large discretion on how to enforce these policies.To be effective in restoring the balance in our local job market and levelling the playing field for Singaporeans, the PSP thinks that we need policies with hard targets, like the ones PSP has proposed.We hope that the Government will continue to strengthen support for unemployed and under-employed workers and raise the wages of low-income Singaporeans at a faster rate. The PSP has proposed a minimum living wage to do this. We also look forward to contributing to the debate on the new workplace fairness law next year.We have also pushed for improvement of the financial security of Singaporeans, which is most affected by the affordability and accessibility of public housing. We had a substantive debate on this issue for some 12 hours in February, initiated by Hazel Poa and me.The public housing debate is yet another example that shows the value of having Opposition Members in this House. We have reflected an issue that many Singaporeans are deeply concerned about, advanced Singaporeans\\' interest and aired their doubts on the Government\\'s narrative about affordable housing in Singapore.Despite our very limited resources, the PSP has put up two key policy proposals to reset our housing policy – the Affordable Home Scheme and the Millennial Apartment Scheme. We have researched and thought through these policies before raising them in this House. They are rational alternatives that we believe will better achieve our desired outcomes of affordable housing and family formation, while delinking retirement adequacy from housing prices.I welcome the Government to provide statistics to substantiate their rhetoric that our alternative policies will cause a crash in the housing market.During this session of the 14th Parliament, we will continue to scrutinise the Government\\'s housing policies and keep a check on the Government\\'s move to stabilise prices in the housing market.In particular, Singaporeans are anxious to know what solutions the Government has to resolve the lease decay problem. For a Government which prides itself on efficiency and not shying away from politically difficult decisions, it is hard to understand why the Government has not announced further details for the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS) or other solutions for the lease decay problem in the past five years.We will continue to ask the questions that Singaporeans want to ask but may not be asked by Members of the ruling party. That is our duty as a responsible and rational Opposition party.We will also continue to put up alternative housing policies that we believe will be in the interest of all Singaporeans.As always, we expect these policies will be robustly challenged by the Government, but we hope that these policies will not simply be brushed off as raiding the reserves or crashing the housing market – just because they do not fit into the Government\\'s framework for the reserves of finances, or challenge the Government\\'s \"sacred cow\" policies like homeownership.I hope that the Government can refrain from such posturing so that we can have a more productive debate in this House. Like I mentioned earlier – a fair arena for one and all.During her address in 2020, the President said as masters of our own land, Singaporeans must have confidence in their rights and privileges of citizenship. Last week, the President spoke about deepening Singaporeans\\' sense of shared identity. These two issues are interlinked.All Singaporean should identify with the notion that we are masters of our own land and our shared identity should be grounded in the rights and privileges of citizenship.PSP welcomes foreigners to complement the Singaporean Core, but first and foremost, the PSP will do all it can to protect the position of Singaporeans as masters of our own land. PSP understands and empathises with many Singaporeans who feel like they are second-class citizens in Singapore today.Life is tough for many. Singaporeans feel like they are draining their resources just to stay afloat instead of being empowered to swim towards a better life. Naturally, they feel resentment when they see an influx of wealthy new immigrants setting up family offices and driving up property and COE prices.During my walkabouts, many Singaporeans have expressed to me that they are aggrieved that many naturalised Singaporean Citizens who arrived in Singapore comparatively recently enjoy most of the benefits of citizenship and can gain from the resources that past generations of Singaporeans have accumulated without having to serve National Service or even volunteer service in the SAF Volunteer Corps.Eighteen year-old Singaporeans make immense contributions to us being masters of our own land by serving National Service. To recognise this, the Progress Singapore Party has supported lowering the voting age to 18 since our party was founded and I repeat this call today. This is also the stance of the Workers\\' Party and Ms Sylvia Lim just reiterated that in her speech today.In addition, we must do more to prioritise Singaporeans and redistribute economic gains so that these perceptions can be corrected and we can empower those Singaporeans who feel like second-class citizens today.While we support an open economy, with the free movement of labour and capital, such movement must be carefully controlled and calibrated. In the labour market, the interests of Singaporeans must be prioritised. In the housing market, we must ensure that public housing remains affordable and accessible and that rising land prices due to an influx of wealthy foreigners who are allowed to purchase private property to not cascade down into the HDB resale market. PSP will continue to fight for all these during this session of Parliament. Mdm Deputy Speaker, the urgent need for a refresh of our social compact means that we must rethink and may even have to discard many of the old policies, in order to bring Singapore to greater heights.PSP believes that we need to have a new set of alternative policies that will serve us better going forward. In the last session of this Parliament, we have proposed some of those alternative policies for providing good jobs and affordable public housing to Singaporeans. As members of a responsible Opposition party, Hazel Poa and I will continue to propose more alternative policies for the rest of our term as NCMPs. We hope the Government will notice our serious alternative proposals this time. Singaporeans deserve better. For country, for people.Mdm Deputy Speaker: Dr Wan Rizal.',\n",
       " 'Mdm Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the Motion. Meritocracy is a core value that has been instrumental to our nation’s success. It is the principle that individuals should be rewarded based on their abilities and achievements, regardless of their background. It has driven Singapore’s economic growth and helped create a prosperous, inclusive and diverse society.However, we must also recognise that meritocracy is not a perfect system and I am glad Mdm President touched on this. It is important to acknowledge the role that socioeconomic factors and perceived structural inequalities can play in limiting opportunities for certain groups.To address these challenges, we must continue to promote our brand of meritocracy that ensures everyone has the tools they need to succeed and one that has a broad definition of success. And this is where education plays a crucial role, in not only being a vehicle of social mobility but providing multiple platforms for individuals with different interests and passion to develop. This, in turn, will foster equal opportunities for all.Madam, education is the cornerstone of our society, shaping the hearts and minds of future generations. In our pursuit of meritocracy, we must continually invest in early childhood education to provide a strong foundation for our children.Early childhood is a critical period in which cognitive, social, and emotional skills develop rapidly. By nurturing these skills from a young age, we can ensure that every child has an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of background or circumstances.  In the fervent words of my maiden speech, I implored that we enshrine early childhood education as a fundamental right, a conviction I hold steadfastly to this day.  For me, this transcends the mere number of children attending school; it represents a profound transformation in our collective consciousness, a shift that underscores the indispensable value of making education not just accessible but unequivocally compulsory. The Government has made significant strides in improving early childhood education. Therefore, I welcome the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF)’s addendum outlining plans to strengthen preschool education and ensure affordable and accessible quality childcare.The KidSTART programme, for example, has successfully provided early childhood development support for children from low-income families, helping to level the playing field and give these children a better chance at success. Madam, in addition to early childhood development, we must ensure that our education system provides multiple opportunities for success. MOE has championed this cause by offering diverse educational opportunities to cater to our student’s unique strengths and interests.Over the years, I have had students from various educational backgrounds in the polytechnic. Some came from the ITE, others through the Poly Foundation Programme – they are actually \"N\" level students – and some were \"A\" level students who decided to switch. Regardless of their background, I have seen them doing very well when pursuing their Diploma in the Polytechnic, partly due to them pursuing their field of interest. Some continue to pursue their degrees afterwards, while others are in a job where their interests match.As an educator, all I want is for my students to develop at their own pace and fulfil their passion and potential; and I have yet to be disappointed. This is a testament to our education system, which has evolved over the years to accommodate diverse interests and learning styles, foster creativity and promote critical thinking. Madam, as an educator for over 20 years, I have been fortunate to witness first-hand the transformative power of education and its impact on the lives of our fellow Singaporeans.  One of my former students, Ibrahim, switched from the A-level route to do a diploma. He came from a humble background and faced some challenges in his educational journey. Nevertheless, he persevered and completed his diploma. What stood out was that he was positive, he was hard-working and was a natural leader – traits that go beyond grades. After a few years, he secured a place in university and landed a fulfilling job in his field of choice.Ibrahim’s story is a testament to the power of education and the opportunities it can provide. In this rapidly evolving world, our education system must adapt and innovate to foster well-rounded individuals who can thrive in diverse environments.  Ultimately, we, as a society, must recognise that success is not just about grades but also about developing character, values and life skills. By shifting our focus to this holistic approach, we can empower our youths to become resilient, adaptable and compassionate leaders of tomorrow. Madam, next, I would like to address an issue I have been pursuing throughout my stint in Parliament – which is mental health.Our society has made great strides in recent years, recognising mental health as a critical aspect of our overall well-being. We have seen public awareness campaigns challenging stigma and, most importantly, more people stepping forward to seek help. However, our work is far from over. We must continue our efforts to destigmatise mental health, recognising that it is as important as our physical health. We have a collective responsibility to create an environment where everyone can access the support they need without fear of judgement or discrimination.  The Government has recently invested in various initiatives to promote mental health. The efforts by the Inter-agency Taskforce on Mental Health and Well-being and expanding mental health services in polyclinics are commendable examples.  As we forge ahead, I would like to suggest a few areas for consideration.Firstly, we must increase access and reduce costs as well as waiting time for mental health services. We can achieve this by enhancing the affordability and availability of mental health services through Government subsidies and expanding such services in the heartlands. Additionally, The Mental Well-being Circles must be adequately and rigorously trained and deployed to provide that much-needed first tier of support in the community.Secondly, let us continue to invest in preventive measures focusing on early intervention. By providing mental health education in schools and the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) and equipping dedicated staff with the necessary skills and resources, we can identify and support students at risk of developing mental health issues. Lastly, we must continue to fund and increase funding for mental health research. Research not only helps us identify factors contributing to mental health issues, but also informs the creation of effective prevention and intervention strategies. Additionally, research findings can guide the improvement of mental health services and the development of policies and programs tailored to individuals’ needs. As we strive to create a brighter future for Singapore, let us remember that mental health is not an issue that can be resolved overnight. We are better together. And it requires continuous effort and dedication from all of us, working hand-in-hand with the Government, healthcare professionals, educators and community partners. Madam, let me share a story that has left an indelible mark on my heart. I once had a student named Sarah, not her real name, who struggled with severe anxiety. Through early intervention, dedicated support from her teachers and her family’s unwavering love, Sarah overcame her challenges. Today, she is a thriving young woman, passionate about advocating for mental health awareness. Her story is a testament to the transformative power of understanding, empathy and timely intervention. It is a reminder that together, we can create a society where everyone has the opportunity to flourish, regardless of the challenges they may face. As we work towards this goal, let us channel our collective passion, energy and commitment to ensure that mental health remains a priority on our national agenda. Sir, in Malay, please.(In Malay): The HealthierSG initiative is testament to the Government\\'s unwavering commitment to the health of all Singaporeans. Through Healthier SG, the Government will enhance preventive care and empower citizens to manage their own health and undergo regular screening.Recently, Minister Masagos, in his speech at the M3 Healthy Investment Family Festival, underlined the importance of addressing health challenges directly and investing in preventive measures for a healthier future. I fully believe that the HealthierSG initiative will improve our community’s well-being significantly. I had previously shared my efforts to achieve a healthier lifestyle.  Last year, although I did not \"appear\" fat, but through health screenings, I was told that based on the Body Mass Index (BMI), I was overweight and I needed to make a major change in lifestyle. I am grateful that I managed to lose 15 kilogrammes and managed to maintain the same weight since then.  By encouraging regular health screenings, we can detect health problems earlier and prevent their condition from becoming chronic.Apart from health screenings, the HealthierSG initiative can improve our community’s well-being by promoting a healthier diet, exercise, and mental wellness.  I urge community leaders to work closely with grassroots organisations and residents to develop a health programme that suit the unique needs of their respective communities. One example is the initiative by M3@Jalan Besar. At the end of the month, a pilot training programme for coaches lasting 6 weeks will be launched to build a network of like-minded community leaders to promote and manage healthy living activities. We aim to equip them with basic knowledge about healthier lifestyle programs and ways to plan programs that are suitable for the demographics of their respective towns. They will also be trained to manage the Healthy Investment programme with the support of HPB as part of the new Focus Area 5 (or FA5) area within M3.Madam, health is our personal responsibility. We are obligated to take care of our health so that we can prevent chronic diseases and lead a healthier life. When we are healthy, we will be able to better support our families and communities.(In English): Madam, in conclusion, let us be the voice for those who may be struggling in silence and let us be the agents of change that drive our nation towards a brighter and more inclusive future, a nation where mental health and well-being is valued and supported.As we move forward, let us remember that progress and success are not just about achieving individual goals. Instead, we must work towards building an inclusive and compassionate society where every Singaporean, regardless of their background, has the opportunity to realise their dreams and contribute collectively to our nation’s success and progress. So, let us stand together, united in our commitment to this refreshed meritocracy. Let us continue to innovate, collaborate and co-create a brighter future for our children and future generations. In the words of our founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew, “A nation is great not by its size alone. It is the will, the cohesion, the stamina, the discipline of its people and the quality of their leaders which ensure it an honourable place in history.”Let us honour his legacy by striving for a better, more inclusive, compassionate and resilient Singapore. Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Motion.Mdm Deputy Speaker: Minister Masagos.',\n",
       " 'Mdm Deputy Speaker, across the world, social mobility has been a challenging issue. Many advanced societies have faced wage stagnation. Some youths in other countries do not believe that they will be better off than their parents. In addition, many wonder if they can achieve their aspirations, or they will be kept in the social class they were born into.In countries where this hope has disappeared, the \"have-nots\" tussle with the \"haves\", there is a loss of unity, and society is fractured, weakened. And when the absence of upward mobility is overlaid with racial or religious fault lines, the social fabric frays quickly. We must not let this fate befall us.In Singapore, we have kept social mobility alive across generations. This remains our promise. We want to build a country where there will always be opportunities for families to better their circumstances, and where their children have hope of a better and brighter future. Let me share key features of our society and what we need to do to sustain social mobility.First, Government policies as enablers. Governments must always prioritise, invest in and preserve the social foundations of societies to provide a fair chance for everyone to move up in society. They must address the under-provision of at least three public goods: education, healthcare and housing.Society must accept policies that even out disparities to help address disadvantages families may face.Over decades, we have built a strong foundation in Singapore. We provide families with access to affordable education, housing and healthcare, enabling Singaporeans to pursue their aspirations and realise their potential – the story of Ibrahim cited by Dr Wan Rizal just now, is just one of many stories of Singaporeans that succeeded because of their education; and Sarah, for access to good health systems. Coupled with Government efforts to make Singapore attractive for investments, we enjoy economic growth and create good jobs for Singaporeans. Together, these have helped to uplift generations of Singaporeans.These fundamentals continue to undergird our strategy today. We continue to make significant investments into public education, affordable housing and quality healthcare. It is why Singaporeans continue to sit shoulder to shoulder – and all can access quality healthcare at our public hospitals and their children attend school together. Sustaining these policies across generations is no easy feat. But we have managed to maintain the provision and quality of these goods on an even keel, without ballooning social expenditures that, ultimately, the taxpaying public has to pay for.Second, a strong sense of personal agency and industrious work ethic. For countries to be successful, its people must be earnest in pursuing their aspirations and work hard to earn their success. From the day Singapore was independent, we understood that no one owes us a living. We had to work hard to get where we are today. This ethos is deeply embedded in our psyche. Singaporeans know this and respect those who have earned their success, and similarly, want to work hard to do well for themselves, their families and communities. It is this spirit that will propel this country forward amidst headwinds.Third, those who have done well giving back to society. We have seen this in Singapore\\'s early years where philanthropists and businesses raised funds and set up hospitals and schools. The community contributed to those in need among them. As our country prospered, we saw more individuals and companies giving back to society and uplifting others.We must keep this spirit of giving back alive. Giving back to society is a key ingredient of our country\\'s success, where those who have done well acknowledge the role society has played in enabling the person to succeed and find ways to benefit others, and help others succeed too. As I said five years ago, this is how meritocracy can be moral: when the successful demonstrate a sense of duty to society, when they share the fruits of success with others.And importantly, we all must work together for the common good. We must never underestimate the power of working together. When different entities can come together and work in sync towards a common goal, we can achieve a great deal. It is this quality – of private, people and public sectors working together – that helped us pull through during the pandemic and remain united. Not pulling in different directions and, ultimately, undermining society itself.Mdm Deputy Speaker, we must harness these qualities and work together to tackle the issue of social mobility and to uplift those in need in our society. The Government will strengthen our policies to uplift lower-income families.First, we will give all children a good start in life. We are convinced by evidence that investments in the early years build a strong foundation in our children\\'s lives. This is why we have invested significantly in affordable and quality preschools. We are also providing more intensive support to support mother and child early on in life, through KidSTART. We do not wait for families to come forward. Instead, we reach out to parents as early as during the mother\\'s pregnancy and work with a team of healthcare and social service professionals, volunteers and community partners, to support these children to give them strong chances early in life. This prevents disparities in the early years from snowballing into greater disparities down the road. Since we started KidSTART in 2016, over 6,000 children have benefited.We will intensify our efforts to start children from lower-income families on the right path. We will scale up KidSTART nationwide by 2026 and continue to facilitate priority enrolment for children from lower-income families in Anchor Operator Preschools and MOE Kindergartens.Investing in the early years is not just good science, it is also fiscally prudent. It gives us the best chance of setting children up for success and is more effective than tackling issues downstream.Second, we will provide more support to families. Over the years, this Government has strengthened social safety nets. We have provided transfers and subsidies and targeted assistance to those who need them most. We have designed schemes to keep people in employment and ensure wage growth.But we can do more. We will be proactive, because we know we need to identify issues early before they snowball into larger issues. So, that one thing does not lead to another: a health issue does not become an unemployment issue of another family member, which in turn affects their children\\'s education. We will also ensure that lower-income families get the help that they need quickly and easily. Ultimately, we want families to achieve stability, self-reliance and social mobility – the three \"S\"es.To do so, we will ensure our services are family-centric and easily accessible. This is what ComLink sets out to achieve, by providing wraparound support for families with children living in rental flats. ComLink is another programme that does not wait for families to come forward to get help. A befriender proactively reaches out to families to understand their various needs and aspirations, and works with them to develop goals and action plans. Government agencies and community partners stand behind the befriender and work on the back end to coordinate suitable services and programmes for the families.From four pilot towns in 2019, we have expanded ComLink island wide to 21 ComLink communities, each supported by a Social Service Office. We are further integrating social programmes under ComLink, such as KidSTART, UPLIFT Community Network and Project Dian@M3, so that families receive support from a single touchpoint.To make it easier for families to receive the support they need, we introduced scheme bundles so that lower-income families on ComCare assistance can access other assistances easily. As data is shared on the back end, families can receive assistance without submitting the same information to different agencies.We will ensure that our social services are comprehensive, convenient and coordinated, so that families can get the help they need quickly and easily.Third, we will reinforce and support the personal agency of families who wish to improve their circumstances. Many families want to secure a better future for their family and are taking active steps to uplift themselves and their children. During our Forward Singapore engagements, some have suggested that we should find ways to encourage families who take positive steps, such as securing stable employment and ensuring that their children attend preschool, but to do so in a manner that does not erode their sense of self-reliance and personal agency.When such families put in the effort, we know they are on the road to making progress in their lives. And as part of our social compact, it is good and right that we recognise such efforts. So, we are studying how to do this in a bigger way, under ComLink.Fourth, we want more social service partners across society to uplift communities across Singapore. Uplifting those in need goes beyond social services agencies. It involves businesses, community partners, neighbours and volunteers. It involves all of us. We need partners to share their resources and know-how and distribute their social capital to uplift those who have less.We want to harness the best of organisations to address the needs of communities in innovative ways. This means leveraging organisations\\' assets, expertise and networks to enhance opportunities for lower-income families. For instance, organisations can run mentorship programmes in their workplaces, widening the horizons of youths from less privileged backgrounds and inspiring them to work towards a brighter future.Businesses have an important role to play. It is timely then that many businesses are moving beyond traditional corporate service responsibility (CSR), to weaving social impact into their very core. They know that their success is tied to the success of Singapore. Recognising their responsibility to the wider community, they are reshaping their businesses. Businesses know they are a better and more attractive company when they put equal emphasis on Environment, Social and Governance (ESG). They fulfil their social responsibilities from how they look after their employees, hire inclusively, to how they harness their businesses to make a positive impact on the community.We need businesses to lead the charge and role model the ways in which they uplift communities. We will guide businesses in better measuring and expanding their social impact. We will celebrate and recognise businesses and other partners in this Year of Celebrating Social Service Partners.We recognise that philanthropists, foundations and other entities, like family offices, also want to do good. We have extended our tax deduction rate of 250% for donations until end-2026. The Government will also do more to help private capital and family offices maximise their philanthropic impact.In our efforts, we must also tap on the best minds and translate the best research into practice to make a tangible impact. I am glad that many academics, researchers and institutes of higher learning (IHLs) have taken a keen interest in and are actively working to strengthen and support our families, from evaluating programmes that seek to ensure every child gets a good start in life, to examining ways we can enhance family resilience, so that our families can bounce back after setbacks. We must tap on the wealth of knowledge and expertise at these IHLs to better and more effectively uplift our communities.For example, drawing on its know-how in early childhood education and social work, the Singapore University of Social Sciences worked with ECDA to launch a training programme to equip KidSTART practitioners with the knowledge and skills to better support the development of children from lower-income families. We will strengthen our collaboration with academics and IHLs to improve policies, social work practices and the delivery of services to meet evolving social needs in Singapore.In my speech at the President\\'s Address debate in 2018, I called for a Singapore brand of meritocracy. Today, I call on our IHLs, academics and researchers to conduct original research and build up a robust body of knowledge of social science that applies to our context, one that is made for Singapore.Mdm Deputy Speaker, no Government can sustain social mobility by its efforts alone. Everyone has a role to play in supporting those in need. As part of our refreshed social compact, we must find ways to benefit others and help others succeed and do well together. Individuals, families and our society will be better for it. This is how an inclusive and caring society is built, by the hands of its people.We will achieve much more when we work together than going in alone. To better support families, we must join hands across society: businesses, social service agencies, community partners, volunteers and the Government working hand-in-glove.Over the past few years, we have expended significant efforts to organise ourselves better to support families, coordinating our collective efforts under ComLink. I recall a family receiving five bags of rice from five different well-meaning social service agencies and corporates, which the family had no need for. Our hope is that, with ComLink, community resources can better harnessed to fulfill real needs.What this could look like is: in each ComLink community, a volunteer befriender works with families to refer them to services, such as career coaches to help them secure a job and nearby preschools and after-school programmes provided by the community to support the education of their children. Companies step in to provide mentorship and internship opportunities to the youth to nurture and grow their aspirations.I have seen a glimpse of what is possible in ComLink@Jurong West, where UOL-Pan Pacific Hotels Group provides opportunities for children from lower-income families to access their facilities and enrichment classes, through NUS students stepping forward as ComLink befrienders to journey with families.Rather than each of us going at it alone and duplicating efforts, let us synergise our various efforts into an effective national movement to better support families in need. Let us cast our nets wider beyond our own sectors and work together in common cause to uplift those in need. Let us work together to keep social mobility alive in Singapore. Mdm Deputy Speaker, in Malay, please.(In Malay): Singapore must continue to be a country where there will be opportunities for families to better their circumstances. A country where they can fulfil their aspirations to secure a brighter future for their children. And where our people believe that our brand of Singaporean meritocracy works. To achieve this, we need a strong partnership across sectors, with each sector doing its part: the Government developing policies that help our people progress; the community harnessing available resources to address its needs; and volunteers bringing their skills and talents to uplift the lives of those around them.The mark of a strong social compact is when successful individuals give back to society. We appreciate the efforts of our Malay/Muslim Organisations (MMO) who have long played important roles in uplifting the community. Many of our Malay/Muslim professionals have also stepped forward to serve and contribute to those in need. For example, Lawyers@M3 brings together lawyers, legal professionals, and individuals with legal backgrounds to conduct talks on legal matters, Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) workshops, and pro bono legal clinics for the community. In their spare time, a group of soldiers also volunteer as mentors at ITE College East through Project Pathfinder, serving as role models for the students they journey with. The Muslim Healthcare Professionals Association (MHPA) also works with M3@Towns to bring health-related programmes and workshops closer to residential areas, to better benefit the community. One of the traits that our community can be proud of is the progress that we made over the years, with the community and Government working together, by putting their minds and hands together to uplift the community. The self-help group MENDAKI has become a model that many parties abroad are keen to learn from. It was formed 40 years ago, at a time when our community leaders were concerned about the educational performance of our Malay children. They were committed to helping Malay children reach their fullest potential and attain success. Today, MENDAKI remains relevant as it uses education as a key driver to uplift the community. MENDAKI successfully mobilised the energies and passion of its many volunteers to drive programmes like the MENDAKI Tuition Scheme and KelasMateMatika, for students across all levels today. These MENDAKI volunteers understood our customs and culture and thus helped to augment the Government\\'s efforts to improve Malay/Muslim educational outcomes in tandem with other communities. Today, 99% of every Malay student cohort completes at least 10 years of education. This is a meaningful achievement, as the 10 years of education provides the foundation to enable them to further their studies at the post-secondary level and enable them to pursue lifelong learning. I am heartened by the progress made by the Malay/Muslim community, which was possible due to the awareness of the importance of education as well as the hard work and close partnership of all parties. Let us continue the efforts to enable our children to achieve their fullest potential.  Today, we must take reference from the latest findings from research and science. The research shows that the early years are crucial to a child\\'s development. Therefore, a key aspect of our strategy to sustain social mobility in Singapore is early childhood development. We must ensure that children are enrolled in preschool by around age 3. We are doubling down on our efforts to support families with young children through Project Dian@M3 and will also facilitate priority enrolment for children from lower income families into Anchor Operator preschools and MOE Kindergartens. Our Dian Ambassadors have started visiting these families fortnightly, working with families to read with their children and support the parents in being involved in the development of their young children. Over the decades, the Malay/Muslim community has made great progress on all fronts. This includes achieving stability, self-reliance and social mobility, while continuously giving back both to the community and to the nation. As we face new challenges and as our society continues to grow and evolve, we will continue to work closely with community leaders, Malay/Muslim Organisations, and our many volunteers. This will bring the community closer together to excel and uplift the lives of the most vulnerable. I am confident that our Malay/Muslim community is well placed to forge ahead towards an even brighter future as a Community of Success.(In English): Mdm Deputy Speaker, let me conclude. We must be a society where Singaporeans will always have opportunities to forge a better life for themselves, regardless of their starting position. We must draw on the strengths of individuals and families, the social capital within our communities and resources from the public, people and private sectors to realise this vision. I know we can because we are Singaporeans.Ahead of the 100th anniversary of Mr Lee Kuan Yew\\'s birthday, let me share a quote which I think is evergreen, though he said it in 1965. He said, \"Ten years from now, it will be better than now. Today, it is immensely better than it was 10 years ago. It is better, even, than last year. And it is ours, provided we have got enough sense to be together and nobody can keep an industrious people to work and fight for its future.\" [Applause.]Mdm Deputy Speaker: Order. I propose to take a break now. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at . Sitting accordingly suspended at 4.12 pm until .Sitting resumed at .[Deputy Speaker (Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo) in the Chair] DEBATE ON PRESIDENT\\'S ADDRESSDebate resumed.Mdm Deputy Speaker: Minister Chan Chun Seng.',\n",
       " \"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I welcome the Government’s commitment to improve social safety nets to help Singaporeans better cope with setbacks in life. One group of Singaporeans which I would like to appeal for more support is families with autistic children, in particular those from the lower-income families.  One in 150 children in Singapore has autism, higher than the global average of one in 160 but lower compared to countries such as the US, Japan, Denmark and Australia, which is one in 60 to 70. Experts think that our high rates is partly due to greater detection from higher awareness and testing, and if data from developed countries like the US is an indication, we may detect more cases in the future. Hence, it is important that the Government expedites the setup of a national infrastructure to provide holistic support for Singaporeans with autism, from diagnosis to end of life.Early intervention is critical. The Ministry of Health (MOH) can or may ramp up public education efforts to increase awareness among parents to diagnose their children as soon as possible if they notice the symptoms. Parents should be reminded to follow up with their children’s developmental milestone checks at polyclinics, clinics or hospitals. Upon diagnosis, these children need to be given sufficient treatment and therapy at the optimal frequency to give them the best chance to develop to their highest potential. This is an essential and the best investment we can make in them, especially during the small window period when they are young, which will yield good progress and benefits over the long term.Parents should also be provided with comprehensive advice by an appointed Government agency on how to navigate our system for the best care and protection for their children. This includes sharing with them the trust services of Special Needs Trust Company (SNTC) supported by MSF and available insurance coverage. I urge the Government to work with the insurers to improve access to insurance coverage for persons with autism. They must not be discriminated against for unrelated risk factors, which is the most common and longstanding complaint.For low-income families, we must ensure that the treatment is affordable to them and provide the appropriate subsidies so that they will be able to keep up with the therapy. Counselling and adequate support should also be provided to the family members who often suffer from caregiver fatigue and burnout as well as depression. We need more activity and care centres for children and adults with autism to engage them and allow family members to work with peace of mind and caregivers to take regular breaks.For lower-income families, the lack of capacity in these centres often mean that someone in the family, often the mother, would not be able to work because she becomes the caregiver. This is a blow to their household income, plunging them into deeper financial difficulty.The new daycare activity programme by the Autism Association (Singapore) making use of community spaces such as public libraries and schools to address the issue of the lack of capacity in daycare activity centres for those over 18 years old is a good start.Autism lies on a spectrum, so while there are those who will be able to work and live independently, there are others are not able to do so. We need to establish care arrangements for them when their ageing parents and families are unable to continue taking care of them, especially the financially disadvantaged ones.As sudden changes to their routines can be distressing for them, advance planning is important. The preparation includes introduction and exposure to facilities, environment settings, volunteers and care professionals as well as financial arrangements and legal documentation.  Next, I would like to appeal for more support and assistance for our SMEs. There are many schemes and grants available, but some business owners have trouble navigating and understanding the processes. They are confused by the red tape and even need external consultants to advise them on what they are eligible for. Unfortunately, the owners and consultants' own interests do not always align, as the consultants' earnings are based on certainty and quantity of their commissions. Accessible, timely and neutral advice from knowledgeable agency staff would make a very big difference.As the President noted in her address, Singapore will face more resource constraints – land, labour and carbon – in the near future. In addition, governments of major economies are providing support to boost their own industrial bases. There will be a greater drive for nationalistic projects. The global business environment will become more difficult for us.  I am heartened that our Government will provide more support to promising companies, including customised financial support for local companies to build sustained R&D and innovation capacity and to go global and grow into Singapore global enterprises. Will the Government consider publicising and sharing more about companies tapping capabilities in the IHLs as well as the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) and engaging on platforms such as the Global Innovation Alliance? This will help to raise awareness, inspire and encourage more Singaporeans to consider entrepreneurship.  Singapore is working hard to attain food resilience and the Government is stepping up investments in food research and development such aquaculture, urban agriculture as well as alternative proteins. This is an appropriate and important sector for our SMEs to participate in. We need to increase local demand so that the cycle of local supply and demand is sustainable.  May I also urge the Government to work with SMEs to improve their access to procurement opportunities? It is important for our domestic capability resilience to nurture and build local expertise in as many sectors as possible.Decarbonisation provides generation-defining business opportunities and our Singaporean companies are well-positioned to lead the way. We need Enterprise Singapore to provide more assistance to SMEs so that they know how to measure emissions as many MNCs have started to request their SMEs suppliers to furnish their carbon emission data. SMEs need to keep down their business costs, of which their vehicles’ Certificates of Entitlement (COEs) constitute a portion, a big portion. Presently, car dealers bid for the COEs regardless of whether there are clients buying cars from them or not. They can keep and hog the COEs for months and trade and sell these COEs to other car dealers. If only individual buyers or companies which need COEs are allowed to bid for them, it may bring down the COE prices of Category C. I hope the Government can consider this suggestion.Finally, I reiterate my appeal to MOM to review the foreign worker work permit quota since a number of SMEs, like the small or medium audit firms, face manpower constraints, especially those in the F&B sector. They are unable to hire enough Singaporean workers to meet their operational needs and are struggling to stay in business, even if they have enough demand and clients. I would like to conclude with my support of the Motion of thanks to the President.Mdm Deputy Speaker: Ms Tin Pei Ling.\",\n",
       " 'Mdm Deputy Speaker, I stand in support of the Motion of thanks. The COVID-19 pandemic was a crisis of our generation but also a test from which Singapore emerged more united and our trust in each other strengthened. But we must not take this for granted.As we reopen the Parliament, it is indeed timely to refresh our focus and renew our commitment to our people and Singapore.Looking ahead, our operating environment is increasingly complex. Pressures in and outside of Singapore continue to mount and these can threaten to tear us apart. Game-changing technologies, rising cost of living, shift in social values and heightened international contestation are some of the key forces pulling us in different directions. And none of these is abating.Therefore, even as we strive for progress and push for excellence, we must ensure that Singapore remains united. Our policies must remove barriers and minimise gaps, our Parliament must focus on building up trust, not tearing down and our society must be more inclusive and compassionate.President Halimah spoke of broadening meritocracy and making sure that it continues to work well for all Singaporeans. I agree. There is no better alternative to meritocracy but we need to temper it so that it is more compassionate and more relevant to today’s context.My take is that for those among us who can and want to excel, we ought not to limit them and should wish them well. For those who want to but cannot because of financial circumstances, then we must intervene more strongly to support and move them along. It is not just about giving equal opportunities but to direct more resources to help the abled but underprivileged.We also need to maintain our egalitarianism. One thing precious about Singapore is that despite our different jobs and roles in the economy, we still see ourselves as Singaporeans of similar standing and similar in other areas too, for example, in our taste for hawker foods. \"Towkays\" and workers can all turn up at the same coffee shop to queue for \"bak chor mee\" or \"roti prata\" and share a table to eat thereafter. There is no expectation that one should be deferential or give way to another. The expectation is that they will be treated all the same.Meritocracy can lead to differences in economic outcomes, but these should not lead to differences in social treatment. Our system must give all our people equal rights and opportunities. All of us must affirm our egalitarianism in both spirit and practice.Allow me to share some specific thoughts.First, on education and skills-based workforce. Yesterday, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong spoke of creating Singapore to become a full-fledged learning society, from cradle to grave. Indeed, we must.Disruptions brought about by technological revolutions have been a constant feature throughout history and the pace is gathering. The Great Reshuffle also means that jobs and skills needed are changing and will continue to change. For instance, according to LinkedIn\\'s \"Future of Skills\", skills needed in the technology, information and media industry in Singapore have changed by 36.8% between 2015 and 2022, just a span of seven years. And specific to this industry, seven out of the 10 top skills are considered new. These new skills include new programming languages but also softer skills such as stakeholder management and strategic partnerships.Clearly, we cannot expect to learn the universe in school, but we can acquire the basics from which we continue to build.Our education should focus on inculcating a sense of curiosity in our young, so that they will always be intrinsically motivated to seek out new knowledge and skills.Over the years, changes have been made to the system, but we could do more to foster a culture of curiosity. For example, could we focus less on standard answers but more on imagination and creative solutioning? Indeed, our education system has done away from PSLE T-score and replaced streaming with banding, these are encouraging moves.But what about students who are inventors and storytellers or who have topics of interest not found in the textbooks? How can we recognise and reward them more formally? Can there be an \"independent study\" subject that allows the student to choose a topic of interest to deep dive into and be given a grade that is just as important as an English or math subject, so that we move towards learning that is more versatile, more blue-skies thinking and hopefully, less need for tuition, which is often cited as a costly endeavour that widens the gap?As pointed out, learning does not stop after graduating from the mainstream education system. In future, as industries continue to be disrupted by new technologies, we can expect to change tracks many times in our working lives. Mature workers starting afresh in radically new industries several times, within a lifetime, will become a norm and it would no longer be something to feel embarrassed about.To support this, adult learning should then focus less on long, structured courses with expensive certificates, but shorter and more targeted ones to build practical skills that can be readily deployed at work. Would the Government expand the SkillsFuture credits to enable this? And could we recognise these credentials by recording them as part of our national digital identity, creating a personal digital resume for each Singaporean? The Public Service can perhaps take the lead in formally recognising these short courses taken by officers.Second, a mastering technology and not be mastered by technology. A key development driving the next wave of disruption is artificial intelligence (AI). Goldman Sachs estimated that AI can replace 300 million full-time jobs. This prospect sounds scary. But what is scarier is that the stiff competition to lead in the field of AI could mean a willingness to overlook ethical considerations and other consequences.For example, ChatGPT caught the world\\'s attention in recent times. We are all impressed by its almost-human capabilities. But has the company OpenAI really thought through the long-term social implications of ChatGPT before releasing it? Media reports would suggest that it had not. Consider ChaosGPT, which is the autonomous implementation of ChatGPT that is touted as \"empowering GPT with Internet and Memory to Destroy Humanity\". While ChaosGPT has yet to work out how to really destroy mankind, but by its autonomous nature, it will keep going until it achieves the goal it is given. And with each iteration of technological advancement, one can be sure that ChaosGPT will also get better. Surely, OpenAI could not have invented ChatGPT to destroy ourselves. Even if there was a tinge of hesitation back then, it is now too late to pull back, because the launch of ChatGPT triggered a frenzy amongst tech giants like Google and Baidu rushing to release their own versions of generative AI. When technology confers power, an arm\\'s race begins. Some questions arising from this are: while people are still struggling, in trying their best to keep up digitally, would we have inadvertently moved the goal post so much that we widened the gap between the digital know and know-nots? And between those who have access to powerful technology, and those who have not. What happens if enterprises increasingly feel that \"it\\'s okay\" to ignore ethics, to be irresponsible and just do whatever to make money? What happens if fakes get proliferated and it becomes too difficult to discern what is real and what is not?Given enough time, nothing is impossible with technology. But we as humans, must collectively exercise the will to draw a line in the sand and be clear about what technology must never replace or do. In this case, Governments around the world have a duty to draw that line, coordinate legislation and enforce it. We must embrace technology to better lives, but we must master it and not be mastered by it.Third, on foreign investments and talents in Singapore – value-adding beyond the money. We should continue to welcome high quality and committed foreign talents and enterprises to Singapore, to supplement our Singaporean Core.The Global Investor Programme has been one way of welcoming investments to Singapore, bringing along invaluable industrial capabilities and availing job opportunities to Singaporeans.But we want them to do more than just putting money here. We should make it an explicit requirement for them to contribute socially and to integrate more. For example, require the GIP applicants and Tech Pass holders to commit to: (a) delivering lectures to tertiary students or civil servants every year to enhance frontier industry knowledge; (b) mentoring local start-ups; and (c) adopting a community or charitable programme.By explicitly requiring them to take part in these activities, we create opportunities for meaningful interactions and thereby, breaking down pre-conceived opinions and promote better mutual understanding. Having chosen Singapore as a destination, I am sure these distinguished business leaders will be happy to support good causes here.Fourth, on meaningful ageing so that every day is worth looking forward to. Over the years, Singapore has done tremendous work to create the conditions for our seniors to age in place. Looking ahead, we must continue to pay special attention to our seniors. As family sizes shrink, we can expect more seniors living alone for longer. Hence, we must work to keep them socialised and keep them healthy, even as we continue to emphasise family values and prioritising family support. Our policies and programmes will also have to be designed with future seniors in mind.In my opinion, learning is a great way to stimulate minds and build confidence. In embracing lifelong learning, we could introduce scholarships for seniors to pursue tertiary diplomas or degrees, and celebrate these mature graduands, so that the scholarships are not just limited to youths or young people, but to our mature Singaporeans as well. Is it not exhilarating to defy age stereotypes and know that \"I still got it\"?In essence, seniors should not be \"waiting to die\". This would reflect a certain grief over losing mental and physical capacities. We must work hard to deliver a different, better future for our seniors. Ageing need not be a countdown to life. Entering the silver years can be a new beginning, where there is life, people, new dreams and new adventures worth looking forward to every day.Madam, often when we debate about income gaps and the way forward for Singapore, questions on whether economic growth should be a priority will inevitably arise. I believe that we should not be obsessed with economic competition or figures, but we must also not despise growth and progress. Because of our economic achievements, even the most vulnerable member in our society can access world class education and healthcare, supported by bursaries and the 3Ms – namely MediSave, MediShield LIFE and MediFund. And because we have a strong reserve, we have the fiscal capability to surmount the pandemic and the quiet confidence to face the unknown.Hence, we must excel in whatever we do, but for those who have moved further ahead, remember to look out for and help others who are still struggling. This is the more tempered and more compassionate meritocracy that we desire. We should aim for everyone to be one mass, not stretched thin and far apart and move ahead together. I think this is more powerful as an engine for Singapore.Finally, we as Parliamentarians, have an important duty and role to play in building a united Singapore. We are the voice of Singaporeans. During debates, we must allow diversity of voices so that issues can be considered comprehensively. But we must do so with the aim of illuminating the facts, explaining the trade-offs and bringing everyone to a common ground, not to drive wedges, and deepen social fissures that will fracture our nation.We only have one Singapore. What we have today was painstakingly built over a whole lifetime and more. But to destroy this, could be as short as within just one day. We must not take this for granted. And therefore, I hope as we reopen the Parliament, as we continue to chart the way forward for Singapore, we will continue to do so with Singapore in mind and to build a stronger nation for generations to come. [Applause.]Mdm Deputy Speaker: Dr Shahira Abdullah.',\n",
       " 'Mdm Deputy Speaker, thank you for allowing me to respond to the President\\'s Address.In February, news broke that Anglo-Chinese School (Primary), or ACS Primary, would relocate to Tengah in 2030. It garnered significant attention from the media and public, the alumni and parents. Some applauded the move saying that it would bring about a more diverse student population, which is a view I wholeheartedly agree with.You see, I am of an age in which many of my friends and colleagues are planning for the primary school admission of their children. Many of them come from very humble backgrounds, working hard to get to where they are today. They were able to do so due to our strong emphasis in meritocracy and it speaks towards the success of our education system. For those with a more comfortable financial situation, these parents will naturally seek to pass on these advantages to their children.However, the quest to do so has turned the provision of education and learning into something akin to a competitive arms race. My child is just shy of one year old. Nonetheless, I too feel the pressure when my peers talk about selecting preschools, whether to choose Mindchamps or Odyssey vs the preschool right under the block. Or what kind of enrichment classes should they send their child to, from Heguru to Kumon, speech and drama classes, art class, swimming class or coding class?I hear of and know several parents who have moved to a location near a primary school of their choice, often paying a premium to do so. Some have resorted to renting houses near these schools. All very real things that parents have done to provide what is best for their children. But what about those who are not able to afford these opportunities? When pursuing the ideals of meritocracy, not everybody starts on a level playing field. Will they get left further and further behind?This ties in with the first key priority in Mdm President\\'s Address, which is how the Government will expand opportunities throughout life for all, regardless of individual backgrounds and circumstances. Mdm President\\'s concern was on how we \"must not allow advantages and privileges to become entrenched and persist over generations\".This is something I feel most strongly about. And this is what I will focus my speech on.In theory, a meritocratic society means that a person earns their success through their talent and hard work. Aspirational but in some ways also an illusion. As illustrated, a child with a more privileged family background and financial situation may be scaffolded in ways that may allow them to achieve success more easily. Education may be a social leveller but access to education may not be equal.We must do our best to ensure that all children have equal access to quality education in Singapore. We have taken many bold steps in this, from removing PSLE T-scores to introducing full subject-based banding. We have also introduced an expanded KidSTART which seeks to provide a strong foundation for children from low-income households in Singapore by aiding their parents and caregivers in early childhood development. However, I would like to touch on the intense competition among parents to gain a Primary 1 place for their child. The Primary 1 registration system essentially aims to address many different goals and does strive to ensure diversity in the student cohort. My concern though, is that for certain more popular schools, more privileged families may have more advantage for the different phases. For example, a family may move to a location to have an edge in terms of proximity. Parents working to make ends meet may also be unlikely to be able to spare the amount of time needed to fulfil the volunteering hours needed to qualify for Phase 2B. Alumni places in prestigious schools in affluent neighbourhoods may also contribute to the risk that certain schools may become more exclusive with a more homogenous, higher socioeconomic status (SES) student population.This is why I believe ACS\\' move to Tengah is a forward-looking one. The move appears to have struck a chord among its alumni and has raised uncomfortable discussions on what we have to do as a society to achieve inclusivity and diversity. But I think it is a step in the right direction. Can I dare hope that this move also emboldens the boards of other popular primary schools, particularly those in certain affluent neighbourhoods, to do the same?Secondly, we need to promote a diverse range of pathways to success, valuing not just careers of knowledge and intelligence, but skills and care-based careers as well. These types of careers are equally important. At the height of the pandemic, we saw how the nation depended on the essential workers – our nurses, delivery drivers and cleaners – to carry on, even as the rest of the nation was safely sequestered at home.However, they are often overlooked. Our society tends to value paper qualifications. An ongoing study by Assoc Prof Irene Ng of the National University of Singapore (NUS)\\'s Social Work Department found that those with university degrees earned more than twice those of ITE qualifications and secondary or lower education. It is not enough to speak of an appreciation and respect for the nature of such work. To truly alleviate the dignity of such work or, in the alternative, to make such work viable for the highly capable among us to consider taking up, change must be reflected in the remuneration.Therefore, I am heartened that Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong and Minister Chan reiterated that call in their speeches to make sure that the wages of skilled and care workers will be increased to reflect the mastery of their skills. In doing so, it sends a strong message to Singaporeans that skilled work is important and slowly shifts the social value placed on such work, creating a more inclusive and equitable society. A recent article in The Straits Times had asked: how would you respond if you graduate daughter dated a plumber? Let us hope that with this, the answer will increasingly be \"no problem\".Even in a highly automated world, humans are still able to offer a blend of knowledge, technical and care skills that surpass any present robot we have. As someone who works in the healthcare field, it is plain to see that robots just cannot replace the need for care and empathy from another human.Lastly, achieving a broader, open and compassionate meritocracy in Singapore requires not only policy changes but also a fundamental mindset shift. We must recognise that every individual has something to offer and we must be willing to acknowledge and remunerate them for it. We must send a message to our youths as well, that their value does not lie in academic qualifications alone but in their other strengths as well and that when they have achieved success themselves, they too have a role to build the next generation. Mdm Deputy Speaker, I stand in support of the Motion.Mdm Deputy Speaker: Minister of State Gan Siow Huang.',\n",
       " 'Mdm Deputy Speaker, I thank Members Mr Desmond Choo, Minister of State Desmond Tan and Mr Raj Thomas, Mr Patrick Tay, Ms Jessica Tan, Ms Tin Pei Ling and others who expressed their support for lifelong learning, which is what underpins our national SkillsFuture movement. I also thank their many suggestions on how we can make SkillsFuture more impactful and effective for Singaporeans.Deputy Prime Minister Wong spoke a new approach to skills yesterday, one that requires a fresh commitment to making continuous learning, upskilling, reskilling, a way of life. We will work with industry partners and training providers to offer courses to meet different training needs, encourage employers to support the development of their workers and recognise the skills the workers have acquired and, of course, support individuals to take ownership of their lifelong learning journey.Mr Patrick Tay\\'s analogy of a CET toolbox is an apt one to describe the opportunities but also the challenges that adult learners face. There are three key things that are needed for the toolbox to work well. First, the toolbox must have a wide range of tools to cater to different adult learners with very different training needs. Some require skills top-up for new tasks or roles that their jobs require. For these learners, short courses, like what Ms Tin Pei Ling suggested would suffice.To cater to such learners, the institutes of higher learning (IHLs) are offering modular upgrading. SSG has also launched SkillsFuture series courses that are short courses designed to address skills needs in high growth emerging areas. Last year, 32,000 individuals attended SkillsFuture series courses. Others required more substantive skills reboot by pursuing a full qualification especially if they have left former education a long time ago or they are switching to a new sector or new job role.Next, I agree with Mr Patrick Tay that people need to open the toolbox and know how to use it. With a toolbox of diverse tools, we acknowledge that navigation can be an issue for some. SSG is enhancing the MySkillsFuture portal to improve user experience and provide personalised course recommendation based on individual\\'s careers and skills needs. We also have a team of SkillsFuture Ambassadors on the ground to provide advice to Singaporeans who want to learn more about the courses and programmes available. We will study Mr Patrick Tay\\'s suggestion to allow Singaporeans to use SkillsFuture Credit for career coaching services.Third, I agree that tools must be able to get the job done. This speaks to our efforts to ensure that the courses are relevant to the industry and are of high quality and the employers recognise the skills that their employees have acquired.SSG has reviewed the course fee funding framework to ensure that SSG\\'s highest tier of subsidies are channelled towards courses that deliver the strongest employment outcomes. These changes will be implemented progressively to allow our IHLs and training providers to adjust their offerings.Employers must also play their part to recognise the skills that their workers have acquired through training, place them in appropriate jobs and remunerate them appropriately. To support employers in doing so, SSG is working with the trade associations and chambers (TACs) and professional bodies to recognise skills attained through courses or on-the-job training in selected sectors.Moving to the subject of job security, our labour market move has posted strong growth last year. We are at full employment with long-term unemployment at 0.7%. Our resident employment is higher now than it was pre-pandemic. However, we are mindful of the global economic uncertainties and how this may affect jobs here. At the same time, many businesses, especially SMEs have told us about the acute shortage of labour.The Singapore Business Federation (SBF) has asked us to allow businesses to ease foreign worker measures. Ms Janet Ang just a while ago also said that the shortage of labour here can cause burnout of our local workforce and limit our companies\\' growth opportunities.We thank Mr Leong Mun Wai for his suggestions, many of which had been raised and debated at length in the past two years. At this year\\'s Committee of Supply (COS), MOM outlined the strategies and measures to help Singaporeans seize opportunities in the economy and be empowered to take on the good jobs. We will walk with Singaporeans every step of the way through new initiatives, such as Career Health and Careers Finder. But MOM cannot do this on our own. We seek everyone\\'s understanding that we need partnership with the industry, employers and the unions on this journey.Mdm Deputy Speaker, let me now speak on support for parents with young children. I have met many parents in my work at MOE and also as an MP. Most desire to be good parents and want the best for their children. But parents may not always know what is required as every child is unique and constantly growing up.I will touch on the support for parents by three groups: fellow parents, employers and the community. It is important to have a strong ecosystem of support for parents to make parenting a fulfilling journey. I believe children are more likely to grow up resilient and confident if parents guide and support them well.First, on the support for parents by parents. Almost all MOE schools have Parent Support Groups (PSGs) today. While the main objective of PSGs is to enable partnership between the school and parents to strengthen support for our students, they have also become a source of support for parents.Many of our PSGs are led by parent volunteers with experience in parenting and who are willing to serve as resource and peer supporters to fellow parents. Some of the parents continue to serve as PSG leaders after their children have graduated from school. I encourage parents to contribute or participate in the activities planned by the PSGs.There is much that PSGs can learn from one another too. MOE has set up PSG Support Circles, which are communities for PSGs to come together to support fellow parents in nurturing resilient and confident children. Some of the common interest topics that they have chosen to cover thus far include cyber wellness, mental well-being of children and forging stronger parent-child relationships. These parent-led initiatives seek to equip fellow parents in detecting signs of distress in children, learn where they can get help from and how parents and teachers can work together to support the development of children. An example is the \"Let Us Chat\" Programme that seeks to strengthen parent capabilities in building good relationships with their children to enhance their children\\'s mental well-being. This PSG programme has been shared with at least 30 schools. It focuses on understanding ways to build children\\'s self-confidence, self-awareness and self-regulation, encouraging an attitude of lifelong learning instead of over-emphasis on grades and understanding the underlying causes of children\\'s behaviour through productive parent-child conversations and relationships. Indeed, there is much more parents can achieve by learning together with fellow parents. Next, on support by employers. For parents who are working, having a workplace with supportive bosses and colleagues can make a lot of difference. It is understandable for parents with young children to need some time off occasionally to bring their child to the doctor, look after a child who has fallen ill, or simply to cheer their child on who is receiving a prize or performing in school. For employees with genuine needs, we have to find practical solutions for them to continue to meet their responsibilities at work and at home. Over the years, the Government has progressively enhanced leave provisions for childcare, infant care, maternity leave and paternity leave. These are definitely useful and well appreciated by parents with young children. I remember my maternity leave was eight weeks when I had my first child 20 years ago. When I had my second child, maternity leave was 12 weeks. By the time I had my third child, maternity leave was increased to 16 weeks. So, I really see in my own personal journey, progression in Government policies supporting families. Today, a working couple has altogether up to 22 weeks of leave in their baby\\'s first year. From 2024 onwards, Government-paid Paternity Leave will be doubled to four weeks and unpaid infant care leave will be increased from six days to 12 days per parent. Taken together, this means a working couple will have up to 26 weeks of leave in their child\\'s first year. That is half a year of parental leave to bond and care for their newborn.This is helpful for most working couples, but may not be enough for those who have not found viable childcare arrangements and those who have greater caregiving needs.I encourage employers to create workplaces that are supportive of employees with children. Employers that value their employees\\' well-being could benefit from stronger talent attraction and staff retention. Employers who would like to find out more of what they can do may refer to the Tripartite Standard on Work-Life Harmony. The Tripartite Standard lays out a set of recommended employment practices that recognises the varying priorities of employees at different stages of their lives and also how employers can support them in managing both work responsibilities and personal aspirations. The practices in the Tripartite Standard include providing at least two enhanced leave benefits, such as extended childcare leave and putting in place employee support schemes, such as annual family days for employees to enjoy extra time-out with their families.We also have the Tripartite Standard on flexible work arrangements (FWAs), which sets out best practices for employers to provide FWAs, be it flexi-place, flexi-time or flexi-workload. More companies are offering flexible work arrangements now than before the COVID-19 pandemic. This allows parents to better manage their work and family responsibilities concurrently. To entrench flexible work arrangements, MOM and the tripartite partners will introduce a set of Tripartite Guidelines by 2024. The Guidelines will require employers to consider requests for flexible work arrangements fairly and properly.While employers have the prerogative to accept or reject a FWA request, they must have valid reasons for their decision. At the same time, employees should be reasonable in their requests and use FWAs responsibly. Some FWAs may have resource implications for the company, which employers understandably need to consider when assessing the request. For FWAs to work for both employers and employees, adjustments may also have to be made to businesses and HR practices, possibly also to the way work is configured, to allow for the flexibilities.I would like to encourage employers to press on with efforts to make FWAs a reality for their employees where they can. In turn, I am confident that employers will reap the benefits of a more engaged and motivated workforce. This is a win-win outcome for everyone.Ultimately, successful implementation of FWAs requires trust between employer and employees as well as among colleagues at the workplace. Besides an understanding boss, a supportive workplace culture is important to enable working parents to achieve better work-life harmony.  Finally, the community can make a difference in supporting parents. This is especially helpful for vulnerable segments in our community. Community initiatives, such as mental well-being circles, mentorships, free tuition, grocery distributions and respite for caregivers, are just some of the many examples of how the community can chip in to help families in need.Many of these initiatives are led by non-government organisations (NGOs) and grassroots volunteers. We should encourage more of these ground-up initiatives and coordinate their efforts to achieve the best possible outcomes for the families being supported.The year 2022 was the Year of SG Families. We want to build a Singapore that is made for families. My wish is that Singapore will be one of the best places to raise children.Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong spoke about the refreshed social compact of collective responsibility where we need to be less about \"me\" and more about \"we\". It is about what each of us can do to support fellow Singaporeans.The Government will continue to find ways to support families. We will do our best to build a more caring and inclusive society with affordable housing, healthcare, childcare and education to cater to the different needs.To help defray the cost of raising children, we have also enhanced the Baby Bonus Cash Gift, Child Development Account (CDA) First Step and Baby Support Grant for eligible Singaporean children.But these steps alone may not be enough. As the saying goes, it takes a village to raise a child. Some families are blessed to have the help of grandparents and extended family in taking care of children at home while the parents are at work. Some families have alternative childcare support from domestic helpers, friendly neighbours and childcare centres in the neighbourhood. Not everyone is so lucky. Fellow parents, employers, colleagues and the community can play a part as well to make parenting a more joyful and fulfilling journey for all. Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Motion.Mdm Deputy Speaker: Ms Joan Pereira.',\n",
       " \"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I join my parliamentary colleagues in this Motion of thanks to the President for her address.Indeed, I agree with Mdm President that Singapore is one of the few countries in the world where trust between the Government and the people had strengthened after emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic. The events of the last three years highlight the important role Government leadership plays in unifying people and providing a clear direction forward for a nation to work towards.  Not only must leaders be competent, they must also demonstrate in the things they do and say that they have the nation's and the people's best interests at heart. Only by working together can the people and the Government overcome the challenges in their path.Leaders need to understand the big picture, balancing sometimes conflicting interests and ensuring that the pursuit of short-term goals do not compromise our long-term prospects.  The Government has implemented sound policies and measures but, sometimes, those who need help fall through the cracks for all kinds of reasons and we need to identify local community leaders and helping hands, including those in the private sector, who can close the gap in the last mile of assistance delivery. Madam, in Mandarin.(In Mandarin): Leaders need to understand the big picture and balance sometimes conflicting interests to ensure that the pursuit of short-term goals do not compromise our long-term prospects. The Government has implemented quite comprehensive policies and measures, but under certain circumstances, those who need help may not receive assistance for all kinds of reasons. We need to identify suitable community leaders, volunteers or private sector helping hands to close the gap in the last mile to ensure that they receive assistance.(In English): One example I know of was that of a family in distress. The head of this family was the eldest of a group of siblings. The family lives in my constituency.The eldest daughter was trying very hard to be independent and cope on her own while tapping on various assistance schemes. A staff at an organisation providing help was able to earn her trust and managed to persuade her to accept certain changes in the care arrangements for her siblings. Without this particular staff, in spite of the many available assistance schemes, the family would not be able to benefit from them. The ability to plug the gap in the last mile can determine the success or failure of our measures. Very often, the person to bridge the gap is a neighbour or a volunteer who is not as constrained by the rules and regulations of the system and can thus take certain steps to close the loop. We certainly need to nurture and strengthen our social and neighbourhood connectedness to enable the desired mutual help to happen.Of course, the essential ingredient here is trust. Government leaders have to earn the trust of our people so that in times of emergency and crisis, people will trust that they are doing the right thing for the good of the community and country.Leaders also have to be very mindful of how they act and what they say. The impact of even very simple gestures and words can be significant on the lives of the people they interact with.If I may share another example. President Halimah graced the opening ceremony of the Dyslexia Association of Singapore Henderson Learning Centre in March last year. She spoke with a student, Ardyani.Ardyani's education therapist, Ms Miranda, had shared with the centre manager, Mr Bala, that since then, she had noticed that Ardyani has become a little bit more cheerful and confident, participating a little more during lessons and also talking a little bit more to her classmates. Ardyani's mother also noticed that her daughter is less shy in engaging others. Ardyani herself shared that she felt very much encouraged by the President's kind words and gestures during their interaction. Leaders should realise that the impact of such small gestures in inspiring others, be it to encourage someone or to provide some form of support, can really go a long way. There are many leaders amongst us, be it in the Government, private sector, social service sector or among community leaders. I certainly hope and urge all of our leaders to continue to stay close to the ground and to our people, reaching out, touching lives and building more trust day by day. I support the Motion.Mdm Deputy Speaker: Mr Yip Hon Weng.\",\n",
       " 'Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would like to thank Mdm President for sharing her views on the Government\\'s plans and priorities for the remaining term of the Government. Today, I will focus my speech on the topic of ageing, specifically, the concept of productive longevity.We have made significant progress to support successful ageing in Singapore in the preceding half term of the Government. We raised the retirement age to help seniors stay active and engaged in society. Our CPF schemes were updated to better cater to the changing needs of the ageing population. We have strengthened our healthcare system through Healthier SG by focusing on preventive care. We are also scaling up healthcare and long-term care facilities in the community to better support our seniors.But there is still much more to be done. Being a country with one of the highest life expectancies in the world, but also one having the lowest birth rates, we face a double whammy. We must address the reality that every household in Singapore will eventually have a senior member.It is projected that by 2030, one in four Singaporeans will be aged 65 and above. This ratio is expected to increase further.This rapid expansion of our ageing population means that the productive engagement of our seniors is no longer optional. It will be an absolute necessity. We must encourage our seniors to engage in gainful activities that will not only benefit themselves, but also their families, communities and society as a whole.I will speak on three general areas – work, contribution and care for others – three areas which I believe are critical elements for productive longevity. First, Mdm Deputy Speaker, work. Steve Jobs once said, \"Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.\" Wise words, indeed. We can continue loving what we do even as we grow old. We must thereby support our seniors to work longer for those who want to, are healthy enough and still have the passion to do so.The relevant initiatives in this year\\'s Budget are a step in the right direction. It is heartening to note that our senior employability rate is healthy, compared to OECD countries. Correspondingly, we should focus on creating quality jobs for our seniors. This enables them to utilise their depth of knowledge and experience obtained over a lifetime.The health benefits associated with ongoing mental engagement are numerous. Moreover, mentoring and job-sharing allow seniors to pass on their skills to younger and less experienced employees.That said, it is important to recognise that many older workers desire part-time work with flexible options which allow them to spend time on leisure and with their families. I fully support the call for more flexible work options for seniors, as previously emphasised in my Committee of Supply speech.There are several ways that we can implement these options, such as sabbatical leave, job-sharing, micro jobs and phased retirement.These concepts are relatively new to our workforce. As such, there may be resistance and scepticism from employers. The Government should take the lead and show how they can be implemented with minimal disruption while still reaping the benefits.I urge the Government to take more proactive measures to introduce and incorporate these concepts into more places of employment.Second, Mdm Deputy Speaker, is the concept of giving. We must actively encourage our seniors to volunteer and share their skills with others. Silver years can be a time for renewal where individuals can explore new passions and interests, engage in meaningful activities and continue to contribute back to society. The numerous benefits of volunteering for seniors include better self-rated health, higher life satisfaction and prevention of cognitive decline over time.Organisations like RSVP Singapore are excellent partners in growing senior volunteerism. However, we should assess our current volunteerism framework and determine how we can increase volunteerism rates.How do we compare globally with other countries on this front? Are there specific targets that we have set ourselves in this area? Besides, it would also be helpful to consider other demographic factors, such as income level, gender, race and religion, to ensure that volunteering opportunities are inclusive and varied.Third, Mdm Deputy Speaker, we should enable care. Care for seniors and recognising caregivers\\' contributions. This includes providing informal caregivers with more support and professionalising caregiving as a career to meet the rising demand for caregiving needs. The role of a caregiver is a challenging one that requires significant physical and emotional effort.With our demographic shifts, we are also now seeing a greater number of seniors caring for other seniors. In my Yio Chu Kang estate, I have a 70-plus-year-old daughter caring for a 90-plus-year-old mother. This is becoming a regular scenario. Regrettably, we often see the bulk of caregiving responsibilities being shouldered by a single individual – typically a wife, mother or daughter.There remains a significant gender disparity in caregiving, with women assuming a disproportionate amount of the workload. Can we take steps to encourage men to participate more in caregiving? Achieving this will require us to challenge the societal norms and gendered attitudes that place greater emphasis on men building careers and less on caregiving responsibilities.It is essential to enhance caregiver training. This is to ensure that caregivers have the necessary skills to look after their loved ones competently. There are currently over 40 training providers offering more than 200 Caregivers Training Grant-approved courses. Nonetheless, it is pertinent to evaluate the effectiveness of these programmes. What is the current take-up rate and how beneficial do participants find these courses? Additionally, we need to increase awareness about the availability of these courses and ensure that the accessibility and scheduling meets the demand. How can the Government provide additional support in this area?Expanding caregiver support is critical, as Singapore\\'s population ages and more people require informal caregiving. MOH has taken steps to enhance caregiver support. Besides training, as mentioned earlier, over the years, enhancements have been made to financial support, caregiver respite services and platforms to help with care navigation. There have also been continued attempts to encourage flexible work arrangements (FWAs). It is also good that we are recognising that caregivers themselves, too, need self-care to prevent burnout. Can we explore ways to improve caregiver support, such as offering additional caregiver leave?  As the demand for caregiving services continues to grow, we should recognise caregiving as a viable career choice. Professionalising caregiving may attract more people to the profession and improve the quality of care provided. Presently, caregiving is often associated with tasks like medical escorting, personal care and housekeeping.On the contrary, caregiving extends beyond these roles. There are opportunities for specialisation and leadership, including caregiver trainers, managers, schedulers and care assessment professionals, just to name a few. To formalise these roles and provide the necessary training, we need to develop a scheme to professionalise caregiving.As part of long-term planning, we should also consider formal education to provide a solid foundation for professional caregiving and certification. For instance, many community colleges and healthcare agencies in the US offer courses to obtain home care certification. Highly skilled caregivers have more opportunities to service clients, especially those with specific needs, such as dementia or physical challenges.In conclusion, Mdm Deputy Speaker, with higher life expectancy, how will the \"good life\" look like? How can we fully embrace the opportunities that comes with living longer? I have shared in my speech that one way is to embrace productive longevity. It is to be empowered to lead our lives the way we want to – to work, contribute and care for others. To do so, we must also reframe our concept of ageing: first, it is not about when, but now. I circle back to what I said earlier in my speech – an often-quoted statistic – that by 2030, one in four Singaporeans will be aged 65 and above.But we must remember that ageing continues, as we speak. Currently, almost one in five Singaporeans are aged 65 and above. We see it all around us. I certainly see it in my estate in Yio Chu Kang. Over the past three years, I have seen how our residents have aged. It is very visible. More seniors are moving around in the neighbourhood with wheelchairs and walking aids. More requests for aged care services. More wakes to attend.Second, it is about opportunities, not about liabilities. Productive ageing requires a shift in our thinking from a paradigm centred on ageing as being problematic, to one which views seniors as resources – assets that can continue to contribute to society in various ways. It is about opportunities for growth and contribution, rather than casting the aged as a liability.Finally, we need to shift from \"them\" to \"us\". Ageing affects not just our seniors. Ultimately, it is about all of us. Growing old is inevitable. We will all grow old one day. A simple shift on using more inclusive terms, such as \"we\" and \"us\", in place of \"they\" and \"them\", helps all of us to remember that we are all ageing. Personally, I sometimes do get comments from my residents that I look young. But I remind myself that the operative word is \"look\" and that we will all grow old one day and be forced to reckon with our own mortality. We will all need to come to terms and embrace the experience of ageing.Finally, we all have different versions of what is the \"good life\". Notwithstanding, most will agree that to leverage productive longevity, we will need to embrace our silver years – to work, to contribute and to care, and by acknowledging that ageing is not about when, but now; it is about opportunities, not about liabilities; and it is not about them, but about us.Only then, can we turn the good life into a great one.Mdm Deputy Speaker: Mr Gan Thiam Poh.',\n",
       " 'Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Motion of Thanks to the President for her Address. Let me begin in Mandarin.(In Mandarin): I do not think anyone would object to the fact that more support should be given to our disadvantaged groups and lower-income earners to improve their lives and incomes. The key, though, is how we should do it more effectively and more sustainably. Just blindly subsidising people might leave them idle and run the risk of consuming the whole savings?As the saying goes: \"it is better to teach someone to fish, rather than to give him a fish.\"A fish can relieve your hunger pangs in the short term, but not for too long. If you want to have fish throughout your lifetime, you must learn how to fish. That is the best policy.(In English): \"Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.\" Hence, there is a need for the Government to continue to invest heavily in education, SkillsFuture, reskill and upskill training. The Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme, Progressive Wage Credit Scheme (PWCS) and Special Employment Credit (SEC) and so on and so forth are equally important. Whatever more to do or to be done, we should continue to leverage and enhance on our existing schemes.I agree with the President that in an increasingly troubled world, we must stay united and strengthen our bond as one united people. We are not only facing an aged population; we are also facing a declining fertility rate. Our Total Fertility Rate (TFR) hit an all-time low of 1.05 last year.Our old-age support ratio, computed as the ratio of the working-age population – meaning those 20 to 64 years old – per person aged 65 and above, has been declining, from 10.5 in 1990 to 3.8 in 2022, last year.However, the average education level of our population has increased over the same period and so has the average income. Hence, would the Ministry be able to advise if the current old-age support ratio is acceptable, in view of the rise in the average Singaporean\\'s income and the continued investment in education and lifelong learning and training for Singaporeans? We may also need to consider if we should let each generation self-finance their needs in old age, for example, using their life contributions to the nation to avoid burdening our children and grandchildren. At the same time, to survive and stay competitive, Singapore must remain open. But there is a limit to how many foreigners or new citizens any country can absorb before the sense of shared national identity is affected. We must maintain our Singaporean Core and, at the very least, prevent our TFR from declining further. I certainly hope that it is partly due to 2022 being the year of the tiger in the lunar calendar, which usually sees fewer births among the Chinese, and not another indication of a shrinking future generation.The pro-family measures announced in Budget 2023, with the Baby Support Grant extension, cash support, increased Paternity Leave and Unpaid Infant Care Leave, are, indeed, supportive of parenthood. I welcome the commitment made by the Prime Minister\\'s Office in the addendum to extend more help to parents caring for infants.We, as a nation, must continue to try to do more to boost marriage and parenthood. Firstly, the Government may need to play a bigger and more active role to bring our young men and women together. The proportion of singles in the age group below 50 years has increased and, more significantly, the increase is highest among those below age 35 – the age group which is most conducive for having children. We understand that people generally prefer to meet members of the opposite sex in so-called \"natural settings\", even though, for many, their networks and social circles are limited. Nonetheless, we should review how we can improve on facilitating social interactions for our potential couples. For example, I think it would be helpful to review and get feedback on the activities and events organised by the Social Development Network (SDN). What kind of activities and events do the young find attractive and relevant in today\\'s context? For example, do the participants get to learn or experience something meaningful, even if they do not meet someone special?If that is the case, SDN will be able to attract more participants, enlarging the pool and increasing the chances that singles will meet other interesting singles there, as SDN should also be able to offer a value-add which is to provide the assurance that all participants are screened and they are who they claim to be.The Ministry of National Development (MND) is making the effort to ramp up BTOs for all applicants, especially for first-timer families. We welcome the good news. It has many supportive policies which I commend, but I would like to make a request for future flats to be built bigger, like the older flats built in the 1980s and 1990s. A sense of greater available space is more encouraging for families to have a second or third child.From our experience from COVID-19, there is a need to review to expand the programme to build early, before the sale of the BTO flats, with shorter waiting time of 12 to 18 months.Many families with young children depend on migrant domestic workers (MDWs) and nannies to help out with caregiving. However, the standards of their service can vary widely. Is there any way for MOM to set up a training, assessment and accreditation scheme which parents can use to inform them of the capabilities of the maids or nannies they are considering to hire?There is a shortage of infant care, childcare and kindergarten teachers or centres in certain areas. For parents, it is important for their children to be enrolled in centres near their homes to minimise travelling for the kids. Will the Government look into the distribution of these centres and staff, how to attract teachers into these sectors and minimise the attrition rate?Next, I would like to move on to request for a review of measures to manage our national income gap. We have to continue our effort to minimise the social divide in our society. Values which divide high- and low-income groups should be discouraged and harmonious social integration needs to be strengthened.This also applies to the workplace. There is a need for employers to establish policies to nurture a harmonious and caring work culture in our workplaces. A good leader in the company is not only measured by tangible results. He must be able to motivate all his team members with different capabilities and abilities to work hand in hand and care for one another as a team.  We are a competitive society, but we must learn to embrace compassionate meritocracy, especially since we need to have more of the young in our workforce to support the aged.Last but not least, I would like to appeal for more assistance for the middle-income group who are burdened by inflation and rising costs and yet are not qualified for most of the assistance schemes which are targeted at lower-income groups. I would like to conclude with my support for the Motion.Mdm Deputy Speaker: Ms Foo Mee Har.',\n",
       " \"Mdm Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the Motion to thank our President for her address.I support the determination of our Government to refresh our social compact and broaden meritocracy. Our efforts to build an egalitarian society where everyone will be treated equally with dignity and respect must continue. At the same time, we must reaffirm Singapore as an open society, expand our economic space and stay connected to global growth opportunities for Singapore to stay relevant and provide a bright future for Singaporeans.It is against this backdrop that I would like to speak about family offices in their role in contributing to Singapore's development. I declare my interest as CEO of the Wealth Management Institute (WMI). WMI is the host of the Global-Asia Family Office Circle, a network platform that provides a trusted environment for the family office ecosystem to convene as a community to learn about best practices in family office governance, as well as opportunities in Singapore and Asia in areas such as innovation, sustainability, co-investments and philanthropy.The number of wealthy individuals and family offices in Singapore continues to grow which is a testament to Singapore's strength as a hub wealth and asset management.There has been much interest about the arrival of family offices in Singapore recently. From my experience they come from a diverse range of countries from around the world, including Greater China, South Asia, ASEAN, the Middle East, US and Europe.Many of them represent some of the most successful entrepreneurs and business owners across the globe, including notable investors, leaders in renewable energy, pioneers of world-changing technology platforms and leaders of Asia's largest family businesses. These families do not just bring capital but also knowledge, networks, skills and talents as well. These are assets we can channel to support new innovation and enterprise, allowing businesses based in Singapore to benefit from mutual technological innovation and talent transfers.Some of these families also bring long track record of giving generously, sometimes stretching back across multiple generations. They have built schools and hospitals, funded scientific advancements, supported conservation efforts and contributed generously to relief efforts, including disaster recovery and pandemic recovery.Madam, these family offices are coming to Singapore for a variety of reasons. Some are seeking safety and stability, whereas others are expanding to Singapore in search of attractive investment opportunities to support growth in Asia – and Southeast Asia, especially.We are also seeing greater involvement of the next generation of family principals who are increasingly focused on areas such as impact investment, venture capital and alternative Investments.Madam, family offices are typically extremely private. So, recent reports of flashy and ostentatious behaviours are restricted to a minority. Inflows of funds are subjected to MAS' stringent rules of comprehensive client due diligence, including establishing a clear and legitimate purpose of the use of family office structure, ascertaining the ultimate beneficial owners and corroborating the sources of wealth and funds.We should welcome this inflow of family offices because they can bring many positive long-term benefits, but more can be done to accelerate their integration and contribution, and most importantly, orientate them to Singapore's norms, values and ways of working.Madam, the arrival of family offices in Singapore is still a relatively new concept. We have seen strong growth in a short period of time. This means that the industry is still nascent and many family offices are still in the initial stages of development.Family offices typically go through three phases as they set up in Singapore. First, they set up the governance, then investment, and finally, philanthropy and impact.The first stage – governance – is about establishing an effective operational base and putting in place a governance framework under which the family office will operate. Good governance requires careful consideration. How should they set up their legal and trust structures? What systems should they put in place, from financial monitoring to cybersecurity? What should their board and risk management processes be? How can they attract and hire the right talent in Singapore? Who should they appoint as their advisors? How can they meet the evolving regulations in Singapore which have been introduced to raise the bar?As they establish themselves, family offices contribute towards job creation, both directly and indirectly. Even though family offices are typically small in team size, they have to meet requirements on hiring, annual business spending and local investments. The key impact of their set-up in terms of job creation will be driving the additional demand and job creation and professional services such as wealth management, asset management, fund administration, trusts, legal, tax and consulting.Since 2020, WMI has had over 1,500 enrolments for family office-related programmes, in testament to the strong appetite for upskilling in this area.Madam, with the office and governance structure in place, family offices then focus on investments. Family capital is valuable because it can be a useful complement to institutional capital – it can be more flexible, agile and catalytic, often in line with the values of the family.Investments are often the main purpose of the family office. However, before they deploy a large amount of capital or any amount of capital, family offices need to build a robust understanding of the investment landscape so that they can home in on areas of opportunity. Fundamentally, they seek good financial returns and sound business models to invest in, and this often takes time to understand and evaluate the different investment options available. Also, the market environment in recent years has been challenging.They also need to find like-minded partners for co-investments. Many family offices tell us they prefer to co-invest with other families – but only with those that they know and trust. A newly-arrived family office will need to build up these trusted networks before they can co-invest effectively.One current gap is the lack of a systematic on-boarding process to integrate newly-arrived wealthy individuals into Singapore’s enterprise and investment ecosystem so they can become active members of our venture community. There is also a need to help them become aware of the promising research and tech innovations that we have in Singapore from our startup communities and research institutes and where they can help commercialise and scale promising new ideas.Family offices tell us they struggle to navigate the fragmented and fast changing landscape. They share that they need to work hard to understand who the credible players are and what the roles of different ecosystem actors are.Newly set-up family offices need more help to connect the dots of the full spectrum of what Singapore has to offer. We need to help orientate them towards the local ecosystem and curate a systematic introduction to the different areas within the innovation community. This will help fast-track capital deployment.Madam, the third area that family offices consider is how to contribute to impact and philanthropy initiatives, usually across a wide continuum of different ways of doing good. Many family offices actually have a stated objective to give back, in line with their family values.But conducting effective philanthropy is a thoughtful process going beyond cheque-book giving. The inspiration is often deeply personal and tied to the values of the family. Based on these values, families will decide what their impact goals are and which causes to support, what assets they could contribute and how to leverage different giving structures. Giving structures take time to establish.Increasingly, wealthy families want to go beyond straightforward grant-making type philanthropy. They aspire to tap their financial resources and networks in creative ways to make impact. We must evolve our charity policies to support new forms of giving, including venture philanthropy, concessionary capital to impact investing. Madam, in my previous speech, I spoke about generations of Singaporeans having benefited from visionary philanthropists and organisations including the likes of Tan Kah Kee, P Govindasamy Pillai and Ngee Ann Kongsi, among many others. They have contributed to important social services, public healthcare and education, and cultivated a culture of giving that is central to Singapore’s social compact.Today, many among the new generation of wealth owners have a similar aspiration to contribute meaningfully to society. So, what is needed is greater effort to drive awareness and momentum to support both local and regional causes. We should also encourage sharing from family offices who are already major philanthropists, to provide aspirational examples for others.Initiatives such as the recent launch of the Impact Philanthropy Partnership, led by WMI and the Private Banking Industry Group with the support of MAS, will help galvanise more family offices in this area.Madam, in conclusion, today, as Singapore continues to be an attractive destination for global wealthy individuals, our doors will always be open for those who desire and can co-create purposeful wealth with us. To preserve our social compact, it is critical that they are orientated to integrate with Singapore’s social norms and have the right support and access to networks, so that they can ramp up their contributions in terms of investments and impact.Through this, we can make the most of this unique opportunity to shape this growth towards a more inclusive society for the benefit of all. With this, I support the Motion.Mdm Deputy Speaker: Mr Murali Pillai, would you like to adjourn the debate?\",\n",
       " \"Sir, Singapore’s growth from third world to first within a generation has been nothing short of remarkable. Through the triumphs and tribulations, our forefathers have forged a nation not just through resilience but also unity.The responsibility to bring Singapore forward now lies upon our shoulders. We face challenges and opportunities like our forefathers, though of a different nature amidst evolving ideologies and complexities. The popular saying is that it is easier to grow an organisation but always harder to keep up its successes. So, it is, all the more, that we must be alert not to succumb to complacency.For me, the prorogation and our President’s Address provided valuable opportunities for introspection as a first-term Member of Parliament (MP); and today, I summarise my reflections in three key themes.The first is the importance of an effective parliament. In an age of flux and dynamism, policy considerations are seldom linear and there may not be past blueprints and playbooks to rely on.In most solutions, society is overall better off but there is often a cost where a segment may not benefit and this is where different views expressed during a debate is important for the clarity and transparency of all. In such situations where we articulate different perspectives, I would like to echo Mdm President’s message that our conversations must be constructive, respectful and responsible, so that we draw strength from our diversity. To uphold trust in the effectiveness of parliament, we must conduct ourselves with integrity and civility, with truth and logic as the bedrock of what we say; so that at the end of the day, we galvanise our citizens towards a common direction.  Like Singapore’s progress, we cannot take the effectiveness of our Parliament for granted. We should be careful not to follow the path of some parliaments in the world, where divisive politics and appealing rhetoric cloud genuine debates, such that they are not effective in making sound decisions and they confuse the people they serve.In an effective parliament, the responsibility also lies with all of us to be courageous in tackling difficult and potentially unpopular issues, and to make tough decisions for the benefit of Singaporeans.Looking back at the first session of this parliament, I believe this House has done well and demonstrated decisive leadership. I had the opportunity to participate in many of these debates.In passing the multiple Budgets through COVID-19, we have protected lives and livelihoods, averting an economic meltdown; and even though we fared better and emerged stronger compared to many other countries, this House did not shy away from debating on how else we could have done better and how to proactively draw learnings from our experience to ready ourselves for future threats.In the repeal of section 377A, we tackled this important topic even though we could have dealt with this further down the road. Importantly, we did not push the responsibility to the Courts to decide what is good for our society. We debated this issue sensitively with maturity and empathy, and we arrived at a balanced and win-win outcome. And in increasing the GST rate, we bravely acknowledged the need for fiscal sustainability and prudence to support higher and longer-term expenditures, yet effectively transformed what is a potentially regressive tax regime into a holistic and progressive system through the innovative use of enhanced GST Vouchers and the Assurance Package, so that those who are vulnerable are protected, while those who are more well-off contribute more.In these examples and others, considerations and trade-offs were put forth openly, so we could debate these robustly and transparently. As we look forward to the second session of the 14th Parliament, it is imperative that we continue to uphold the effectiveness, leadership and public confidence of this House.Sir, this brings me to the second theme of my speech – that is of clearly recognising the costs, trade-offs and constraints in the debates we make. Failure to recognise these “costs” defies the fundamental concept of scarcity in economics and could leave room for populist politics which will mislead and polarise our society.  Singapore has enjoyed remarkable growth and development. While we continue to cheer and enable every citizen to maximise their potential and lift their ambitions, the hard truth is that it is impractical for our Government to fulfil all desires. Matching limited resources to meet ever-increasing and sometimes near-infinite expectations is an equation that cannot be solved by any government. Hence, this requires us to make choices and strike a balance for our policies to be sustainable.For example, in debating housing accessibility, we all fully agree to younger Singaporeans’ aspirations towards convenience and proximity to their parents' home. However, it is simply not possible for everyone to be availed a Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat in a mature estate as space in such areas are finite. The key question will then be how to allocate them. And in terms of affordability, how should the Government balance between buyers desiring lower prices and sellers expecting higher valuations?An even broader example concerns Singapore’s finances. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) has already stated that Singapore’s expenditures will increase and is projected to rise to 20% of GDP by 2030. The many calls for the Government to do more will mean that spending can easily increase beyond 20%. It is important for us to address transparently, how we are going to fund these increases, without kicking the can down the road.I listened carefully to the Workers’ Party’s (WP) position on this. They oppose not just the GST increase but also the overall GST system, that today contributes $17 billion to our revenues.The WP has offered some policy alternatives, such as to spend more from our Net Investment Returns Contribution or NIRC framework. However, the proposals are not viable to address funding shortfalls.I said at the GST Bill debate, that to spend more from our investment returns and to save less, is an attractive but not a responsible approach. Singapore’s reserves serve as a strategic asset and insurance to support us during crises, and provide us a long-term, recurring and growing annuity to fund our rising national expenditures.MOF has projected that NIRC contributions will be maintained at about the same percentage of GDP over the coming years; and we all know that norms in the economic and investment climate have turned to be more challenging. If we were to spend more from the NIRC now, it must mean that we leave behind less for our next generation. Should we take this path, I worry that our children will be the ones to bear the costs of a much bigger fiscal burden to fund future expenditures.The WP is entitled to a different view, and I respect that. However, they need to be honest about the full implications and costs of their proposals, for current and future generations. We should guard against short-sighted policies that go against our values and principles of how we uphold fiscal prudence. If we do not manage this carefully, trust in our fiscal stability, that we have painstakingly built over the years, can be destroyed overnight.In its manifesto and in this debate, the WP has put forward many proposals, all of which will require more spending. In the coming session of Parliament, I look forward to hearing more from them the details of how the proposals will be funded, especially without GST.In our debates, there will be some areas where we agree and some that we do not, like in the use of reserves. I am confident we will highlight our arguments and debate robustly about these issues. It will then be for Singaporeans to judge which is the more responsible and better approach to take Singapore forward.In the end, it is not a battle between political parties. This is all about us, Singaporeans. How successful we will be, depends on how we approach these conundrums and trade-offs to make balanced policy choices for our society and for our society to see them as fair.It is challenging, but I can see that our Government is dedicated to doing its best; and better relative to many other countries including the ones where I lived in, which is why I chose to return to Singapore; in fact, it is exactly because our Government sensibly acknowledges costs and trade-offs, that it is able to prioritise well and work hard so that our citizens benefit.A microcosm of this is reflected in my own constituency at Nee Soon Link, that has many new Housing and Development Board (HDB) Build-To-Order (BTO) precincts. I have worked with many agencies to initiate and improve amenities, including launching a new bus service, including building many new bus stops when none were earlier catered for. And I am thankful to my residents who had moved in earlier for exercising patience, as we appealed successfully to improve the frequency of bus services when more residents settled into the estate.It is from this perspective that I can attest to the dedication of our Government agencies towards serving our residents, demonstrating empathy and flexibility in calibrating public resources to meet needs on the ground, while ensuring value for money.Sir, an effective parliament and dedicated government are essential; but both by themselves cannot ensure Singapore’s progress. The final theme of my speech is how we all need to be hands on; for all of us, citizens to play our part.In my maiden speech in this House, I spoke about how effective governance is not just about good policies, but also about good execution. Through the various Ministries’ addenda to the President’s Address, I am heartened to learn about the strong reaffirmation and refresh of their plans to take Singapore forward.Ultimately, while the Government can steer through sound policies, it is for our businesses, community partners, families and individuals to take their respective steps towards building a better Singapore.In overcoming the crisis of a generation, we have seen first-hand how a formidable force is built from everyone playing a role, as well as from the partnership and trust between the government and its people. It is also heartening to see that within our towering metropolis and residences, the kampung spirit of old is well and alive. I encourage all of us to uphold this sense of personal and collective responsibility; as well as to continue to look beyond personal interests, so we contribute to building a caring and more resilient society where no one is left behind. The Forward Singapore exercise, aimed at renewing our social compact, encapsulates this ideal best. This social compact is an implicit agreement across Government, individuals, families, community and businesses on what kind of society we want to live in, and what each of us are willing to give – and give up – for one another. It aptly circles back to recognising trade-offs and requires all of us to answer, given constraints, what we desire to build and what we are willing to do more together with the Government for a better Singapore.Sir, we now live in a world characterised by volatility; and where our long-held notions of geopolitical peace, globalisation and trade flows, and economic stability are challenged.I started today’s speech on how the responsibility to bring Singapore forward now rest upon our shoulders. As we forge ahead in the new normal with cautious optimism, we ask not for a lighter load, but for greater strength. I am convinced we can surmount the challenges and capture the opportunities that lie ahead if we come together as one Singapore because we are, Stronger Together! Sir, I support the Motion.Mr Speaker: Mr Louis Chua. \",\n",
       " \"Mr Speaker, in her speech, President Halimah spoke about shifts in the geopolitical landscape and the implications that this will have on the Singapore economy. She described trends that we have been concerned about for a few years now – growing obstacles to global trade and economic nationalism. Both of these trends are expected to persist in the years to come and both of these trends are inflationary.Indeed, the latest Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) data showed that core consumer prices rose by 5.5% year on year in February, with food prices up more than 8%. We have not seen food prices go up so quickly since 2008.Although the MAS expects inflation to “slow more discernibly in the second half of this year” and hopefully “reach around 2.5% year on year by the end of 2023”, the projection for core consumer prices to rise by 3.5% to 4.5% over 2023 as a whole and for headline inflation to average 5.5% to 6.5% is still elevated compared to recent history and certainly out of the comfort range for many Singaporeans.Last year, wage growth for those of us who are employed full-time outpaced inflation but only barely. Real median incomes grew just 2% in 2022, almost half as fast as it used to grow in the pre-COVID-19 years.Working Singaporeans’ earnings power will be reduced again when the second GST hike kicks in in January 2024. I find it ironic that in its latest monetary policy statement, it appears the MAS took pains to highlight that the higher inflation rates we have seen at the start of the year “reflected in part the increase in GST” and that “when the impact of the GST increase is excluded, core inflation would be even lower and closer to the historical average”. Why add fuel to fire?The Government’s support measures are designed to ensure that Singaporeans “with greater means contribute their fair share of taxes”. But from an inter-generational equity perspective, you can see why so many younger Singaporeans feel anxious and uneasy about the future. Some have even given up on the aspirations to raise a family here. Even some senior citizens I have met tell me that they worry most about how the higher cost of living impacts their children and feel compelled to carry on working, even though they may not wish to do so.As workers and business owners, we will strive to be more productive and more competitive, and hope that our wages can go up higher than inflation. But I also hope that the Government can avoid introducing more pressure into the system through an untimely GST hike, especially if wage growth remains uneven or weak.Because when the cost of living – real or perceived – is too high, that hurts Singapore’s attractiveness as a liveable city, it weakens our younger one’s confidence to take risks and we become less competitive globally. Just last month, The Business Times reported that in a business sentiment survey conducted by the Singaporean-German Chamber of Industry and Commerce, almost half of German employers in Singapore polled, or 44%, said “psychological distress and lower work performance is visible among staff” due to the unpredictable housing situation.My second point is about income security for workers who may find themselves displaced if labour market conditions deteriorate.Last week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that inflation is much stickier than anticipated even a few months ago and the chances of a “hard landing” for the global economy have risen sharply. Here in Singapore, gross domestic product (GDP) already fell sequentially by 0.7% in the first quarter of the year, with goods producing industries seeing a sharper 4.1% decline. While the Government has not updated its expectations for GDP growth of 0.5% to 2.5% in 2023, the risk of a recession is only getting higher.Some of you would know that I work in the banking sector, for a bank which is the subject of an emergency takeover. The recent turbulence at our firm has taken a very deep emotional toll on my friends and colleagues. In Singapore, job security is especially vexing because there is no nationally defined social protection floor that our workers can stand on to feel secure. There is also no law mandating retrenchment benefits in Singapore, which could be critical in ensuring displaced workers and their families have sufficient liquidity to meet basic living needs. This is especially pertinent during periods of recession and labour market weakness, where a longer time is needed to secure employment.I was therefore heartened to hear President Halimah say that the Government will study how it can extend support schemes similar to the COVID‐19 Recovery Grant beyond the pandemic. We should explore how the administrative arrangements for the COVID-19 Recovery grant can be adapted for a wider redundancy insurance scheme. The Workers’ Party (WP) has consistently been pushing for a redundancy insurance scheme since 2011 and had also published a consultation paper on this back in 2016.As our economy matures and as economic cycles become shorter and more unpredictable, many of us will have no choice but to make more frequent transitions between jobs and career paths, even when we are not financially prepared to do so.By providing displaced workers with immediate income security, a redundancy insurance scheme can raise efficiency in the labour market and reduce underemployment. It will allow workers to take the time that is required to reskill and find a stronger job fit, instead of being pressured into choices that could hamper their longer-term career mobility, just so that they can pay the bills.With intensifying risks to our economy and labour markets, I hope that legislation on redundancy insurance can be put in place as soon as possible, even if it is called something else like a targeted re-employment scheme. Let us roll it out now before the next recession, when it will be needed.My third point is about a topic which is increasingly a key concern for many Singaporeans and that is housing – to which I wish to first declare my interest as an equity research analyst in a financial institution covering the real estate industry.We have had an extensive debate in this House about this topic just two months ago and I will refrain from repeating much of the points which I have raised back then. However, as I have shared in my speech on the housing motion debates, the root cause of much of our housing woes today relate to supply and the solution really is for the Government to take urgent and decisive steps to increase the availability of public housing and ensure that the housing needs of all Singaporeans are met.After all, while President Halimah spoke of running up against more binding constraints in land, labour and carbon over the coming years, when it comes to having enough space for future generations, Prime Minister Lee gave us an emphatic assurance late last year that “Our problem is not finding the space to build enough flats, nor keeping homes affordable for Singaporeans. We know how to do that”.I am thus comforted to read that Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong shared in a Budget roundtable discussion last month that the root of the problem is a supply issue. However, while I recognise Deputy Prime Minister Wong’s confidence in the Government’s ability to bring stability to the market again and perhaps this could eventually come when recession hits our shores, manifestations of the demand-supply imbalance in our housing market continue to persist in the meantime.House prices have continued to climb, where based on flash estimates for the first quarter of 2023, private residential prices rose 3.2% in the quarter while HDB resale prices rose 0.9%, with both public and private prices up for 12 consecutive quarters now.Over in the public housing rental market especially, The Straits Times reported last week that “overall, HDB rents shot up 27.7 per cent in February compared with a year earlier – a rate of increase not seen in 15 years”, with January too seeing a similarly pace of increase.Based on estimates by the real estate consultancy quoted in the article, the town of Sengkang which I represent had the unfortunate honour of seeing rents rise the most across HDB estates, at 40.4% over a one-year period, with median rents now at $3,200 a month, compared to around $2,200 a month a year earlier.During the Ministry of National Development (MND) Committee of Supply (COS) debates last month, I called on the Government to support Singaporeans who may need to rent in the open market to address their immediate housing needs, given soaring open market rentals. At that point, Minister Desmond Lee shared that the Government will “keep an open mind and keep a close eye on the rental situation and will be prepared to take necessary measures in order to support Singaporeans”.I still hope that the Government will consider intervening in the market sooner than later, rather than continue monitoring the market, in order to preserve open market rental affordability.On that note, I am heartened to note that the MND recognises that we have more singles and caregivers in our society and more young Singaporeans who aspire to live independently. In particular, I am excited to read that the MND is working on developing more inclusive housing options especially for singles, seniors and those with disabilities. Just as I have mentioned in my Adjournment Motion last year, I believe this is the right step to take for our public housing policies to be “inclusive” and to “reflect the diversity of our society”.As part of these options, I would like to once again reiterate my calls made in prior Adjournment Motions to support Singaporeans’ diverse aspirations through expanding on rental housing and to lower the BTO eligibility age for singles from 35 to 28 years old.Our younger Singaporeans aspire to have a place of their own and this is a trend which I believe the Government would have been closely monitoring as well. This is why I have called on the Government to significantly increase the stock of rental flats across flat sizes, thereby creating a viable and expanded public rental scheme, with an emphasis on ensuring that our lower- to middle-income households’ housing needs are well looked after.This is also aptly captured in a recent Mothership series on housing, which documented couples who are affected by the delay in BTO flats but are not lucky enough to secure a flat under the Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (PPHS) and are faced with an option to either stay at their parents’ homes with no private space or pay an increasingly expensive rental lease.Even if the Government still believes in home ownership as a superior model, a pathway to ensure that younger Singaporeans’ housing needs are adequately met is to lower singles’ eligibility age for HDB BTO flats from the current 35 years to 28 years of age. This is when most Singaporeans would have been in the workforce for a few years and have begun to lead more independent lives.This proposal would be a critical change, yet a continuation of the Government’s efforts over the years to expand HDB options for singles while still allowing HDB to give priority to providing for families. In fact, we believe lowering the threshold for owning HDB flats to 28 years would go a long way towards HDB’s stated aims for Singapore’s public housing to be “inclusive” and to “reflect the diversity of our society”.Yet even as we refresh our social compact on housing and reimagine a range of housing options for a more inclusive housing programme, the next chapter of our housing story still leaves one big question unanswered: what about Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS) and the end of the 99-year lease?Together with my hon friends Mr Leon Perera and Assoc Prof Jamus Lim, I asked Senior Minister of State Sim Ann for more details about VERS at the housing Motion debates in February, given that we know hardly anything about it despite it being introduced about five years ago. I am sure the Government would have been monitoring and studying this issue for a long time now and I was carefully scrutinising Mdm President’s speech and the MND addendum to the President’s Address for any mention of VERS and solutions to address the elephant in the room – the lease decay issue – but to no avail. Is this an issue that the 4G leaders are prepared to address?At the housing Motion debates, my hon friend Assoc Prof Jamus Lim highlighted the fundamental tension between housing as a retirement asset and as a home. Our current HDB and CPF policies may be a dangerous game of musical chairs: if one is able to offload one’s flat before its price collapses – as it must, eventually – then we can retire comfortably; but then, the one holding the bag is a fellow Singaporean who bought your resale because they needed the space for a growing family and could not afford to wait for a BTO. Essentially, what goes up must come down. The higher the climb, the harder the fall.And it is not just the WP that is worried about this increasingly untenable link. In a commentary published by the Straits Times earlier this month, Assoc Prof of law Eugene Tan spoke of the trap of ever-spiralling expectations in the housing market, which will be too much to bear for all stakeholders. He shared that “looking ahead, the reality of leases decay – as flats built in the 1960s and 1970s rundown their 99-year leases – will increasingly bite harder. This sobering reality will have to be adjusted to as well even as older Singaporeans hope to leave their residential property to their children”.The WP had proposed a universal sale and lease back scheme that provides a floor price for HDB resale prices where the HDB is the buyer of last resort for all lessees, where each individual lessee is empowered to exercise the scheme and not be subject to a voluntary process which is out of the hands of the individual. Senior Minister of State Sim Ann shared the same notion of having the Government coming in as the purchaser of last resort, although it remains to be seen how this can pan out in practice if VERS, as the name suggests, is voluntary and subject to voting by residents in the precinct.But critically, I struggle to see how amid all of these concerns and the eventuality of the value of HDB flats reaching zero at the end of the 99-year lease, the PAP Government can honour its promise to all Singaporeans as shared by Prime Minister Lee last month, “that your HDB flat will be both a good home for you and your family, and a valuable nest egg for your retirement”.I of course hope that what Prime Minister Lee shared can materialise. But for the sake of the current and future generations of Singaporeans, it is imperative that we lay out our plans to achieve these increasingly untenable links between affordable housing and retirement adequacy. Mr Speaker, allow me to say a few words in Mandarin.(In Mandarin): [Please refer to Vernacular Speech.] In view of the economic slowdown and weakening job market, I would like to urge the Government to roll out redundancy insurance for workers as soon as possible so as to enhance their income security. I would also like to know details of the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS) and the Government’s plans to address the problem of decaying leases of 99-year leasehold HDB flats. Currently, the provision of retrenchment benefits is not mandatory by law in Singapore. However, this is critical in ensuring that jobless workers and their families have sufficient liquidity to meet basic living needs. It is especially important when there is an economic downturn and the job market is weakening, as workers may need a longer time to find employment during these periods. Since 2011, the Workers’ Party has always advocated for the implementation of redundancy insurance and we hope that the Government will legislate this as soon as possible. We must plan for rainy days and be prepared for the next economic recession.On the issue of housing, I am glad that the Ministry of National Development (MND) is aware that there are many singles and caregivers as well as many young Singaporeans who desire to live on their own. It is even more heartening to know that MND is focusing on developing more inclusive housing options. Thus, I would like to reiterate a call made during an earlier Adjournment Motion, which is to expand rental flat options to meet the diverse housing aspirations of Singaporeans and to lower the age requirement for single citizens to apply for BTO flats from 35 to 28 years old. Even as we update our social compact on housing and offer new housing options, there is still a major unresolved issue in the next chapter of Singapore’s housing story. With regards to the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS) and the problem of decaying 99-year leases, what are we doing to address these issues? I have looked into the President’s address and MND’s addenda in detail, hoping to find out the solution to the problem of lease decay but to no avail. Is this a problem that the 4G leaders plan to address?It is difficult to understand how the PAP government will honour the promise made by the Prime Minister last month, considering the fact that the value of HDB flats will trickle down to zero when their 99-year lease ends. On the one hand, we need to ensure that flats remain affordable. On the other hand, we must enhance the value of HDB flats so that Singaporeans will have adequate reserve funds when they retire. So, the Government needs to come up with plans as soon as possible and involve Singaporeans in the discussion. (In English): In closing, I have one final reflection. This concerns President Halimah's remarks that in so many societies, political parties aggravate rifts instead of bringing people together. I hope it is clear to the House and Singaporeans from the positions that I and my fellow WP colleagues have put forth, that we speak always to advance the larger public interest. It would be foolish and self destructive for us to do otherwise. We are Singaporeans too and have just as much of a stake in the well-being of this country as the ruling party does.So, even though my colleagues and I do not enjoy the same access to information, networks and resources that some of our hon Members do, we continue to strive to make constructive contributions to the policy debates of this House.On that note, I look forward to having more robust yet respectful debates in this House – for let us not forget that the capacity to have respectful contestation of ideas and views is a key piece in building public trust in Singapore's institutions.Mr Speaker: Mr Melvin Yong.\",\n",
       " \"Mr Speaker, I rise to thank Mdm President for her address. Before I begin, I declare my interest as President of the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE).Sir, as the world continues to evolve post-pandemic, the way we consume goods and services is also changing rapidly. The digitisation of almost every aspect of our lives has led to a new trend in consumer behaviour – and that is, convenience. Today's consumers have become accustomed to the instant gratification facilitated by technological advancements. With a few clicks on their smartphones, consumers can order anything they want, from delivery of their favourite meals to buying groceries from an online market. Companies that can offer the most convenient solutions are gaining traction among consumers, and this trend is likely to continue.A report released by Meta and Bain & Company in September 2022 forecasted that e-commerce sales in Singapore will reach $19.6 billion by 2027, despite slower growth in 2022 caused by inflationary pressures and COVID-19-related supply chain disruptions. A report released by Shopee Singapore in March 2023 found that there is growing adoption of e-commerce among older users, with 70% of respondents aged 55 and above indicating that they have integrated e-commerce into their daily routine.While e-commerce and online transactions have made life easier, they also carry significant risks and dangers. As more transactions are being conducted over the Internet, the number of online frauds has also increased significantly over the years. My speech today will focus on the need to enhance our consumer protection laws for e-commerce, strengthen safeguards for digital payments, and regulate trending consumer credit schemes such as Buy Now Pay Later services.First, let me start with the need to enhance our existing consumer protection laws for e-commerce.While the general position is that existing consumer protection laws are broad enough to cover online transactions, these were enacted at a time when consumer transactions were predominantly offline via brick-and-mortar stores. Our laws do not sufficiently address the distinction between online and offline transactions and correspondingly the issues that are specific to online transactions.Sir, I have three proposals to strengthen consumer safeguards in the e-commerce space.First, we need to authenticate the sellers on online marketplaces. The duty of ensuring the legitimacy of sellers should be placed on the online marketplaces. By charging platform fees and commissions, online marketplaces are expected to ensure that the merchants listed on their platforms are genuine and legitimate. Online marketplaces should vet, verify and authenticate the credentials of sellers before allowing them to list and sell products on their platforms. Mandating seller verification, which is already being implemented in jurisdictions such as the United States and the European Union, will ensure accountability of sellers for their product listings, reduce scams and aid resolution of consumer disputes.Second, online marketplaces should ensure that there are mechanisms in place to protect consumers’ payments. One way to do this is to incorporate escrow into the transaction process. This means that when a consumer makes a purchase, the payment to the seller is temporarily held by the platform for a period and only released to the seller when the consumer confirms that the item is delivered in good condition. Mandating escrow accounts would give consumers greater peace of mind when shopping online.Third, we should extend our consumer protection laws to cover consumer-to-consumer transactions made through social media platforms. Today, our consumer protection laws do not adequately cover sales transactions made between two individuals via a social media platform such as Facebook, Instagram or TikTok. According to some analysts, the social commerce sector in Singapore is expected to reach more than US$1.25 billion by this year.To foster a safe and trusted online marketplace for consumers, CASE led an industry-wide effort in 2020 to develop Technical Reference 76, Singapore’s first national standards for e-commerce transactions. CASE also introduced the Standard Dispute Management Framework for E-marketplaces in 2021 to guide e-marketplaces resolve consumer disputes equitably and efficiently.I am happy to share that CASE will be launching a new CaseTrust accreditation scheme for e-businesses which will cover the entire range of e-commerce practices from pre-sale to post-sale and address common consumer pain points when shopping online.Sir, as e-commerce and online shopping become part and parcel of our lives, we must ensure that our laws provide the same protection for our consumers, offline and online.Next, let me move on to the Government’s push for greater use of digital payment, which has undoubtedly also facilitated and fuelled the increasing popularity of online shopping.Digital payment has risen sharply in recent years. The convenience of being able to make payments without having to carry cash or visiting a bank is a significant advantage. However, I would like to highlight three risks associated with digital payments.First, the risk of data breach. With digital transactions, there is a rise in data collection, processing, sharing and storage of personal information. Hackers can steal this information, which could lead to identity theft, financial fraud, or other forms of cyber crime. Debit card fraud and phishing attacks are now a common occurrence, which could impact not only the individual but the entire banking system.Second, the risk of system failure. Digital payments rely heavily on technology and any system failure or technical glitch could result in significant problems. Last month, DBS customers were unable to log in to the bank’s online banking platforms, including its PayLah! mobile wallet, for almost a day. DBS' digital banking services previously suffered a two-day disruption in November 2021. Such incidences can create inconvenience and, in some cases, financial losses. Third, the risk of scams. The rise of digital payments has provided an opportunity for scammers to create fake e-wallets, websites and mobile applications to perpetuate their fraudulent activities. In October 2022, the MAS reported 610 cases of banking-related phishing scams involving PayNow transactions in 2021 and the first half of 2022. Victims lost large sums of money when the scammers deceived them into sharing their digital banking credentials.Sir, while digital payments provide convenience, it is important to be mindful of the risks that come with it and further strengthen our safeguards. Cybersecurity should be a top priority, and financial institutions need to implement advanced safety measures to prevent data breaches, system failures and fraudulent activities. More needs to be done also to educate vulnerable consumers, such as our seniors and those who are not technologically savvy, to stay updated and cautious when using these services.Finally, let me highlight the risks of unregulated short-term financing services such as Buy Now, Pay Later, which is prevalent today in many e-commerce platforms, and the need to establish more stringent limits on such transactions.According to a 2021 report by Mileu, close to a fifth of Singaporeans aged 16 and above have used a Buy Now, Pay Later service. According to a report by WorldPay, Buy Now, Pay Later transactions are expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 40% between 2021 and 2025.Such short-term financing services can appear enticing with their zero-interest deals, flexible payment options and convenience of access, but they come with a set of risks that can put unsuspecting customers in financial distress, especially for younger consumers below 21 as many of them do not yet have a stable income.The first and most obvious risk is the accumulation of unforeseen fees and charges. Customers who fail to pay the required instalments on time are slapped with hidden fees and added interest, pushing up the total balance and making it harder to pay off the debt. Buy Now, Pay Later schemes also typically do not conduct credit checks, hence there is no pre-determined limit to how much a customer can borrow. This puts consumers at risk of overstretching their financial capabilities, leading to a spiral of debt.Another risk comes from the psychological impact of these schemes. With no immediate payment obligations, consumers may spend more than they would otherwise, as they feel less connected to the actual cost of purchases. This can lead to overspending and, in some cases, an addiction to online shopping.CASE has called for safeguards to be introduced including limits to be set on purchases and penalty fees, credit assessment of potential users and integration of Buy Now, Pay Later spending data with credit ratings. Some of these proposals have been included in the industry’s Code of Conduct, which came into effect in November last year. But only some. We can and must do more. I urge the Government to impose regulations to better protect vulnerable consumers, such as the young and those already in debt, from exploitation by these schemes.Sir, in conclusion, e-commerce has made significant progress in recent years, from the way businesses operate, to the way consumers find and purchase goods and services, to the way products are delivered to our doorsteps. It has opened a new world of possibilities and opportunities, but also presents new risks and dangers to consumers, both young and old. We must therefore review and update our consumer protection laws accordingly. Our laws must provide the same protection for consumers, regardless of whether we shop offline or online. Sir, notwithstanding the above, I support the Motion.Mr Speaker: Mr Muhamad Faisal Manap.\",\n",
       " 'Sir, I will deliver my speech in Malay.(In Malay): [Please refer to Vernacular Speech.] During the President’s Address on Monday last week, Madam Halimah touched on several issues related to the steps which we need to take to achieve happiness, prosperity and progress for our nation. One of the things that caught my attention was about national politics. Essentially, good politics is necessary to further advance Singapore’s progress, harmony and stability. The opposite type of politics could spark polarisation and divisions.For my speech in this debate, I aim to share my own perspective on what would be considered as good politics. The content of my speech is meant for all participants in national politics, especially members of this House, including myself, and it is meant for all of us to conduct some self-reflection or introspection. In the words of a contemporary political phrase, “ownself check ownself”, in a positive manner. When we point a finger at someone else, we should be mindful that our other fingers that are pointing back at ourselves.Sir, what constitutes good politics? Among the factors that can produce good or healthy politics are firstly, having a level playing field; second, being able to agree to disagree; and thirdly, avoiding actions that cause fear among the public, or in English, “fear-mongering” especially during elections for the purpose of gaining support. Sir, having a level playing field is fundamental to achieve a democratic society, which is something that we want to attain as inscribed in the national pledge – building a democratic society.It is publicly known that Members of Parliament who are not from the ruling party need to put in more effort at the grassroots level to meet the needs of our constituents. This is because we do not have access to the resources of the People’s Association. This is because non-ruling party Members of Parliament who were elected to represent and serve their constituents during the general elections have been set aside in the appointment of Grassroots Advisors. The reality is, for a constituency won by a non-ruling party candidate, the defeated ruling party candidate will assume the role of the Grassroots Advisor. Conversely, for a constituency won by the ruling party, the elected ruling party candidate is concurrently appointed as the Grassroots Advisor. Sir, in reality, we, as non-ruling party Members of Parliament who are not appointed Grassroots Advisors, are unable to utilise the places under the purview of the People’s Association such as the community clubs and the Residents’ Committee offices. Apart from the usage of such places, the People’s Association funds meant for the benefit of the constituents also could not be touched. The same goes for manpower resources. The manpower provided by full-time constituency managers and directors is invaluable.This practice is not aligned with the phrase in our pledge which is to build a democratic society based on justice and equality. Why do I say this?Sir, the Grassroots Advisor is a position entrusted with the power and responsibility to manage public funds, which is collected through taxpayer money, for the use and benefit of the residents of a constituency.It certainly does not align with the values of justice and equality when the ruling party candidate who lost and was rejected by voters at the elections was appointed and recognised by the Government to hold the position of Grassroots Advisor while the non-ruling party representatives elected by the voters were set aside.To illustrate the circumstances more clearly, I will give an example. To date, after almost 13 years constituting two and a half terms which I have served as the Member of Parliament in Aljunied GRC, I still hear comments from my residents during my house visits that the PAP seem to be organising more events than the Workers’ Party. However, when I ask for details of those events, it turns out that they were referring to events held at the community club as well as those organised by the Residents’ Committtee. They said so because they saw the PAP Branch Chairman, who is also the Grassroots Advisor, present at these events as the guest of honour or the event organiser. In fact, some residents also said that their children received their Edusave awards from the PAP. Undeniably, the funds utilised by the bodies under the purview of the People’s Association are for the benefit of the residents in a given constituency. However, it is also undeniable that the existing system creates the impression and assumption that events organised by the People’s Association are events organised by the PAP. Sir, I have proposed in this House previously that the position of Grassroots Advisor should be granted to individuals who are not linked to any political parties so that the People’s Association may be released from any political elements. This proposal was also part of the Workers’ Party manifesto in the previous General Election – ensuring the freedom of national institutions from party politics.I understand that some efforts have been undertaken in this matter. For example, in the Sengkang GRC, the appointed Grassroots Advisors are not members of any political party. Nevertheless, as shared in social media recently, a Sengkang branch chairman from the PAP was invited as a guest for the Edusave awards ceremony and took photos with the recipients and Grassroots Advisor.The question here is, in what capacity did this individual attend a ceremony which was jointly organised by the People’s Association and the Ministry of Education (MOE)? What is the message that was meant to be conveyed? And why was the elected Member of Parliament not invited? Or at least, have both of them invited to this event. Fundamentally and more importantly, where are the values of justice and equality? Sir, although we, the non-ruling party Members of Parliament, lack public resources, we still serve with dedication and direct our total efforts to carry out the responsibilities entrusted by our constituents. I do not mean to complain, Sir. Rather, what I want to raise is whether this is the proper practice in our efforts to build a democratic society based on justice and equality as inscribed in our national pledge? Reflect on it!I now wish to touch on the factor of “agree to disagree”. Staying respectful while navigating differences is important and fundamental in our efforts to preserve and further strengthen unity in society. Differences of opinions and views are a fact of community life. The approach that should be taken in managing and balancing such differences is the “agree to disagree” approach. Failure to do so could lead to conflict and division. Sir, during the debate on the repeal of section 377A last November, there were differences of opinion among the MPs of the Workers’ Party. Some of us supported the repeal while others did not. On this issue, the MPs of the Workers’ Party had discussed and could not find common ground for agreement on this issue, and thus moved to “agree to disagree”. As such, the decision was made to allow each Workers’ Party MP to vote on the matter as they saw fit. Although there were differences in this matter, we all agreed that we needed to embrace unity in diversity. In my perspective, what happened to the Workers’ Party was a reflection of reality, in parallel to what was happening among Singaporeans on this issue, whereby society was divided into two sides – those who were supportive and those who were not. Despite the differences in opinion and principle, these differences did not cause divisions that could have damaged our society because of the existence of tolerance, mutual respect and a willingness to agree to disagree when facing a situation with no mutual consensus. This is what is known as unity in diversity.Sir, unity in diversity is a value that we must uphold as a democratic society as we traverse and advance to a new era of living whereby differences of opinion and principles will become more pronounced. Upholding these values will enable us, as a democratic society, to overcome “cancel culture”, which is a worrying practice because it could adversely impact our unity and lead to divisions. The final matter relates to “fear mongering”. Efforts to scare voters are unhealthy political practices that could lead to polarisation and division. For example, once upon a time, fears were raised that if a political party other than the ruling party is elected and runs the town council, it will lead to bad management to the extent that garbage will pile up as high as a two-storey flat. It was also remarked that the prices of houses in constituencies held by political parties other than the ruling party will be adversely impacted and plunge. In the 2015 General Elections, there were last minute efforts during the campaigning period to spread unfounded accusations to the residents of Punggol East. It was said that the Workers’ Party had failed to explain what had happened to $22.5 million worth of funds which had been transferred from Pasir Ris-Punggol Town Council to Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council. These are among the political practices which are unhealthy and should be rejected. In summary, Sir, in a healthy democracy, the decisions of voters in electing their political representatives should be made based on their considerations on the facts that have been put forward by all parties contesting in the elections and not because of fears which had arisen from unfounded claims. The practice of fear mongering by anyone is irresponsible and goes against democratic values.The conclusion, Sir.Sir, in conclusion, if we want to avoid political divisions and polarisation, worries which had been raised by Mdm President, we must practice and strengthen the aspects which I have mentioned, which are: having a level playing field, agreeing to disagree and, at the same time, rejecting “fear mongering”. If we are able to do that, it can also enhance the level of trust held by our citizens towards the national leadership system, which is another important factor mentioned by Madam President on that occasion. Overall, it will strengthen our efforts to build a democratic society based on justice and equality as spoken each time we recite our national pledge.Sir, I wish to reiterate what I said at the beginning of my speech, that what I am sharing in this debate is not intended to point fingers at any particular individuals. Rather, it is an invitation to all members of this august Chamber, our elected leaders and to myself in particular, to engage in introspection and self-reflection with a view to improving what needs to be improved so as to achieve happiness, prosperity and progress for Singapore. May I say once again that when we point a finger at someone else, we must be mindful that our other fingers pointing back at ourselves. Nonetheless, sir, there is a saying in Malay that goes “whoever eats the chilli will be the one to feel the spiciness”. Let us self-reflect! Thank you, Sir.Mr Speaker: Ms Nadia Samdin.',\n",
       " \"Mr Speaker, Sir, we are in the Second Session of the Fourteenth Parliament of Singapore. The first Parliament of our nation was convened in 1965 and in 58 years, those who came before us built Singapore into who she is today. It is not lost on me that we are still a young nation, a little red dot with homes in the sky, willed into existence by the tenacity of our forefathers and carried by the resilience and harmony of our people today.Statistics show that as a whole, people are living wealthier, healthier, safer and more informed lives than ever before. But we are also facing new challenges that threaten our very existence from climate change to social economic inequality, the rise of nationalism as the war rages on, reshaping our global order and threatening food security. But despite the uncertainty and fragmentation, there are reasons to believe that humanity and that Singapore is capable of overcoming the challenges facing us. As a society, we are more than a sum of our parts and we can work together.In her speech, President Halimah Yacob highlighted that we will continue to support the society where we care for and help one another, and pitch in to make a difference. I would like to thank her for her voice on issues that matter and for setting the tone. Indeed, it is our collective responsibility to shape our new social compact. Beyond providing support, the Government will also reinforce individual and family efforts and bring forth contributions including through committed businesses and a passionate civic society.To ensure that Singapore thrives in another 58 years, we must create an environment where complex challenges are collectively owned and solved, and where each part of society is empowered to play to their strengths where we do not take what we have for granted. My speech today will centre around three points.First, collective action. If there is anything I have absorbed as truth in the past two and a half years or so, is that the person I am, is made possible by the sacrifice and support of my loved ones, and the work that we are able to do on the ground, is made possible by a team as well as residents who look out for each other and the many volunteers.I have witnessed so many everyday miracles that defy the natural divisive forces that threaten to tear social fabric, in particular, during COVID-19 and social distancing. When people on the frontlines when above and beyond their duties; corporates who sent regular food packs to those in need; when a resident receiving welfare put aside some of the money she had received to order confinement food for a new mom, her neighbour, saying that is what she wanted to do with the money; and an uncle who walked to the market despite his weak legs because he wanted to cook a meal for the volunteer befrienders from our amazing Chengsan-Seletar X-teams who came to check on him every week without fail.Over and above, the Government's implementation of schemes such as the temporary relief fund, COVID-19 support Grant, Job Support Scheme (JSS), and the disbursement of $236 million in financial aid in its financial year ending March 2021 – there was a sense of responsibility of what we owe each other as we operate in a society. Zooming out to a societal and global level collective action is critical in tackling issues like climate change which pose an existential threat to our island state.In the President's speech, she highlighted Singapore's commitment to decisive action to reduce carbon emissions and take resolute steps towards meeting our net-zero commitments. Individuals play a role in climate action, for example, through personal choices in consumption energy use and advocacy. But personal sacrifices can never be the sole solution. Systemic change requires large amounts of capital and mindset shifts which means states, institutions and companies have a duty to ignite this transformation.How do we encourage the different sectors with different primary objectives to work together? On this I would like to declare my interests as Legal Council and Senior Project Leader in Tri Sector Associates, a social impact consultancy working on cross-sector social innovation.In a speech last year, the Transition Finance towards Net Zero Conference, researchers highlighted that we are 55% below the emissions reduction required by 2030 and 35% below the investments required for net zero by 2050. Bridging this gap requires concerted and collective action and effective transition finance needs close partnership among the public, philanthropic, private and people sectors. While Governments own the green agenda and can take good outcomes to scale, private and philanthropic investors play a crucial role in providing capacity building and concessional capital to new innovative ideas that may be untested.At this point in history, in order to meet climate goals, we must nurture a collaborative environment that truly embraces co-creation, cultivate solutions that restores not extracts and tries new ways in order to ensure a habitable planet for generations to come.Second, caring for our seniors. A whole of nation approach is not just important for climate change but also for issues like mental health. I was heartened to hear the commitment to tackle loneliness and social isolation in Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's speech. Today, ageing research in Singapore and Japan has shown that lonely older adults not only lived at least three years less than their peers, but also spent less of their remaining life in good health. As of 2020, about 10% of Singapore residents aged 60 years and above lived alone. In their older years women are more likely to live alone than men.As a Member of Parliament to a constituency with many older residents, it was sobering when I first came in to see many empty nests or single seniors. Further in 2020, in the hearts of the pandemic, nationally, we saw the most number of elderly suicide since 1991 – among people aged 60 and above, a total of 154 took their own lives.I felt each elderly suicide that I knew of from the ground keenly. In their golden years, why did things feel hopeless? Is there anything we could have done better to offer a listening year to have been what they needed at that point in time? At each wake, I unearth that while some had strong support from family members who were devastated and questioning what they had missed, others had invisible health conditions or burdens, which felt too great to bear – especially if they were alone.Research has also shown that chronic social isolation increases the risk of mental health challenges like depression, anxiety and substance abuse as well as chronic conditions such as high blood pressure. It also raises the risk of dementia. Other advanced economies are grappling with this issue too. In 2021, Japan appointed a minister for loneliness. The UK has had a ministerial lead on loneliness since 2017, later announcing its inaugural loneliness strategy in 2018 and a loneliness engagement fund which provided grants between £15,000 and £50,000 to organisations, which could engage at-risk groups.Here in Singapore and Interagency Taskforce on Mental Health and Well-being was set up in 2021 and it was announced in 2022 that an SG Mental Well-being Network was formed and that the establishment of a permanent National Well-being Office was being considered.I am grateful that we are moving the needle and hope that we consider more support along the mental health spectrum including considering the availability of insurance that does not discriminate against mental health conditions, lessening the load on Institute of Mental Health (IMH) as an acute hospital and offering more varied inclusive options of care for the community as well as for those who care for them. A whole-of-nation approach is needed. Peer support by friends, friendly neighbours by our people, responsible businesses to adapt and hire inclusively and targeted direction of resources by the Government. We may not be able to save everyone but we must try.In Chengsan-Seletar, we are building on our efforts over the past two years to implement strategic plans for our seniors using a three-pronged approach, based on the theory of change to increase awareness of available resources and to remind our seniors they are not alone. Early detection and screening, creating social support networks and making our elderly feel valued. We are training eyes and ears on the ground through partnerships among postmen and postwomen with SingPost, hawkers and trained psychological first-aid responders, running our 100x Seniors Club to encourage them to come out of their homes and targeting to launch Calm Corners in each of our residential zones to test out evidence-based programmes by ground-up initiatives. Through all this, I hope to remind our seniors that they are not alone and that they are valued.Third, our youths would lead us into the future, by population, use approximately 25% of the residential population today, but 100% of our future. Youths today are dealing with a more challenging landscape as they come of age, confronted with the climate crisis, fierce competition both in terms of placements for local Institutions of Higher Learning and the global talent pool for work. Many also feel sandwiched.However, despite all these challenges. They are the ones who will lead Singapore into the brighter futures. We must invest enough in our youths to empower them to take us forward or face the consequences of them leaving for other pastures. Our youths are equal parts resourceful, creative and resilient and willing to put their hand up and be counted on. For example, two National University of Singapore (NUS) students, Tim and Jen, who volunteer their time on the ground by joining an NParks' working group targeting human wildlife conflict, to interview residents, conduct overnight surveys and actively participated in an Otter Relocation Exercise throughout the night. We are facing new unexpected challenges and I am grateful to youths such as them, who are willing to take ownership in finding workable solutions.But youths cannot do it alone, I have called many times for more space towards ensuring meaningful youth participation not just for quotas or at dialogues. If we want youth to show up, we must also trust them and make space at the table for youths to have a say and stake in their futures.As the co-chair of People's Action Party (PAP)'s MAB Muda, it has been my privilege to meet youths from all walks of life with a variety of interests. For International Women's day this year, two of our youth activists, Anatasha and Nadia interviewed everyday Malay/Muslim Singaporean women to give their stories, values and thoughts or voice via an interview series called Dengar Suara Kita. They ran this independently and I am very impressed by their conviction to take quiet action on this matter close to their hearts. Sir, in Malay, please.(In Malay): [Please refer to Vernacular Speech.] This Ramadan has been a meaningful one for our community. For the first time since COVID-19, we witnessed our community coming together to break their fast and perform their prayers at the mosques with family and friends. In the earlier part of my speech, I highlighted some of my concerns and suggestions relating to seniors and youths. During a mass iftar recently in Ang Mo Kio, I teared up when a grandmother gently patted my face and told me she will pray for me to continue to have the strength to perform my duties. Many of the elderly attendees like her faced mobility challenges and required assistance from a caregiver and needed to use personal mobility devices, wheelchairs or walking canes. With the average life expectancy in Singapore being above 80 years, it is important for us to look into the quality of life in our seniors’ golden years. In order to do so, we must encourage more seniors to take care of their health and incorporate healthier nutrition into their lifestyles. We should raise more awareness among them that they should not be afraid to undergo early health screening because they will be able to take steps, if necessary, to take care of themselves and their loved ones.On youths in our community, I have confidence and faith in their capabilities. It is not only student leaders or scholars who are doing us proud, but everyday youths among us who are taking the time out to be active citizens. For example, during this Ramadan, there were various ground-up efforts by informal volunteer networks of students like the IM Volunteers Network SG, faith groups and motorcycle enthusiasts, for example, Kazoku Riders, who spent time to make volunteering a part of their life. We must continue to find ways to support such groups.In addition to us moving forward in a post-COVID-19 world, we must ensure that all walks of society are involved in building the future that they want. As the Malay saying goes – climb the hill together, descend the valley together – we must continue embodying this spirit so that each generation can achieve an equitable outcome.As more people become involved in society, there will definitely be different views among them. The PAP does not shy away from different views and does not say that we have a monopoly on ideas. We hold many dialogues at various levels and welcome constructive discussions. However, good leadership and good politics should involve a willingness to raise difficult issues and explain its merits and disadvantages before making decisions in the best interests of Singapore and Singaporeans based on the facts available at that time. Sir, that is good politics and good leadership.(In English): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion. Mr Speaker: Order. I propose to take a break now. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at 3.05 pm. Sitting accordingly suspended at 2.45 pm until 3.15 pm.Sitting resumed at 3.15 pm.[Mr Speaker in the Chair]\",\n",
       " \"Mr Speaker, Sir, I seek a clarification of a response given by the hon Member Mr Leon Perera to Minister Ong Ye Kung yesterday. As may be recalled, the hon Member Mr Perera mentioned, in relation to the GST, that the Workers' Party (WP) accepted the GST at 7% and conveyed this in 2018. My interest is that I actually spoke about the WP position from 1993 when the GST Bill was being introduced all the way to date, and I checked the Hansard. So, I would like to seek clarification from the hon Member as to when and where this position of the WP was articulated.Mr Speaker: Mr Perera.\",\n",
       " 'Mr Speaker, Sir, we have just reached the end of the five-day debate on the Motion of thanks to the President. From my rough count, we heard 67 speeches in this debate. I am happy to note that all hon Members of this House who spoke are united in their support for the Motion.Just a short while ago, before the break, I left this Chamber to visit the loo. There, I bumped into an hon Member, who said to me, that he was really looking forward to seeing me deliver my wrap-up speech. Pleased with his exuberance, I asked whether he was interested to get a sneak preview of what I intended to cover later. He, however, demured. He clarified that what he meant was that once I stand up to speak, it will be a cue for his family who is seeing these proceedings \"live\", that the debate would shortly end. [Laughter.]So, just like the hon Minister Edwin Tong who spoke before me, I get the drift. Hon Members will be happy to note that I will only make three short points in my speech.First, I wish to thank the hon Members who spoke for sharing their valuable insights about the Government\\'s plans outlined by the President. This debate is significant because of the sheer breadth and depth of topics highlighted by hon Members for the Government\\'s consideration. I am not able to exhaustively set out all the topics, but will mention a few of them. The topics covered included: ensuring that economic growth benefits Singaporeans from all backgrounds, strengthening the tripartite trust, developing our skilled tradesmen, the need to reskill middle-aged workers for them to remain employable and decisively tackle workplace discriminations. All these points persuasively put across by our hon Members from the Labour Movement, such as Minister of State Desmond Tan, Mr Desmond Choo, Ms Yeo Wan Ling, Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman and Mr Patrick Tay.  Concerns about our social compact, the need to strengthen help for have nots in our society – a point that several hon Members, including Mr Seah Kian Peng, Assoc Prof Jamus Lim, Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim and Mr Leong Mun Wai, made.  Ensuring better educational outcomes and prospects for children and youths from less privileged backgrounds – this was raised by, amongst others, hon Members Mr Vikram Nair, Dr Wan Rizal, Dr Shahira Abdullah and Mr Henry Kwek. Keeping a keen eye on and addressing the impact of cost of living and inflation on our people – a topic that, again, a number of hon Members spoke on, including Mr Ang Wei Neng and Mr Louis Chua. Highlighting the potenfial threat of Artificial Intelligence on our social trust and togetherness, and at the same time, the need to capture opportunities from this technological advancement – points that were eloquently put across by hon Members Dr Tan Wu Meng and Ms Mariam Jafaar.   Ensuring that trust is a two-way relationship between our people and our Government, the need to promote active citizenry and retention of our core values as a society – points raised by hon Members Ms Tin Pei Ling, Ms He Ting Ru, Mr Leon Perera and Mr Shawn Huang. Moving away from credentialism and valuing skills and competencies instead – something that several hon Members spoke on, including Ms Janet Ang.Looking out for the needs of the differently abled – a topic that hon Members Mr Don Wee and Miss Rachel Ong touched on.  Ensuring that our families remain the building blocks of our society, promoting marriages and parenthood, and at the same time, supporting these families as they become smaller and caregiving responsibilities increase – something that hon Members including Ms Jessica Tan and Mr Gan Thiam Poh spoke on. Providing our rapidly ageing society with a befter support structure, tackling ageism and at the same time, empowering them to contribute to our community – points raised by hon Members Ms Sylvia Lim, Mr Yip Hon Weng, Mr Sakfiandi Supaat, Ms Hany Soh and Mr Edward Chia.  Protecting our aged and vulnerable citizens from scams as we continue to digitalise our economy – a topic raised by amongst others, hon Members Mr Christopher de Souza and Mr Melvin Yong.Providing more support to people with mental health issues – an important topic that was covered by hon Members Ms Ng Ling Ling and Ms Nadia Samdin.Opening up a whole range of pathways to ensure that our meritocratic society is more inclusive – a good number of hon MPs spoke about this, including Mr Xie Yao Quan. Concerns about the environmental issues that our country faces were expressed by several Members including Mr Sharael Taha and Mr Dennis Tan.Concerns about the impact of unbridled asset acquisition in Singapore by increasing numbers of wealthy individuals from overseas who set up family offices – a point made by the hon Leader of Opposition.And finally, upholding public confidence in this House and ensuring good politics, strong leadership and good governance at all levels – areas that hon Members Mr Derek Goh, Ms Joan Pereira and Mr Faisal Manap touched on.Notwithstanding the diversity of the topics covered in this debate, I noted unanimity amongst hon Members on the importance of retaining our core values that have been ingrained in our nation by our founding generation of leaders and stood us in good stead for several generations. This is the point that Mr Sitoh Yih Pin emphatically made. He said that our values are and must continue to be hard-coded in our psyche as a people.I agree. This is our secret sauce. This is what will allow us as a nation and society to continue to forge forward to secure a fair share of opportunities for our people to lead fulfilling and dignified lives.Moving on to my second point, I wish to highlight that hon Members had provided a surfeit of suggestions in this debate. These suggestions deserve examination with a view to see if the future plans of this Government that have already been laid out, can be further strengthened by their incorporafion. They include: Linking unemployment support for citizens with their agreement to undertake skills upgrading and active job searching – a suggestion raised jointly by hon Member Mr Desmond Choo. Attaintment of transformative competencies by our children in school – a suggestion of hon Member Mr Darryl David.  Financial literacy programmes for our children – a suggestion raised by hon Member Mr Gerald Giam.  Protection of whistle-blowers who report on discrimination and unfair employment practices – a suggestion by hon Member Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim.Equipping community volunteers with mental health first aid skills – a suggestion by hon Member Ms Ng Ling Ling. Redesigning of the Progressive Wage Models to provide for more wage rungs to enable workers to climb up more easily up – a suggestion by Mr Raj Joshua Thomas.To evolve our charity policies so as to support emerging forms of giving by potential grant-makers – a suggestion by Ms Foo Mee Har.Tapping on our seniors to get them to volunteer and share their skills and experience with others – an idea raised by hon Member Mr Yip Hon Weng.  Legislating the right to work from home – an idea of hon Member Mr Louis Ng. Providing for caregiving leave to take care of elderly parents – an idea of hon Member Ms Poh Li San; and  Encouraging our non-SMEs to embracing inclusive hiring and employ more persons with disabilities – an idea floated and passionately argued by the hon Member Miss Rachel Ong Several hon Members from across the aisle lamented that their suggestions have not been taken up by the Government. I appreciate that they feel strongly about their ideas and are convinced it is for the larger good of our country. I wish to point out that there are also numerous cases of suggestions made passionately by PAP backbenchers which also have not been taken up by the Government. So, they are in good company!I think we can all appreciate that, in assessing the viability of implementing ideas from hon Members, the Executive arm of our Government bears the heavy responsibility of governing. They have to strike a balance between a wide range of factors including policy intent, competing viewpoints and resourcing priorities.In addition, for some of the ideas to be implemented, there is a need for progress to be made over time – a point that was eloquently put across by hon Member Ms Denise Phua who advocated the integrated 10-year education programme from Primary 1 to Secondary 4, almost 10 years ago.Hence, I would not read too much into the Government\\'s decision not to adopt all the suggestions made by hon Members. In fact, if anything, it would be surprising if all the ideas have been accepted without exception.The Government has unequivocally stated on many occasions that it is agnostic as to who and where good ideas come from. As the hon Leader of the Opposition stated in his speech just now, over the years, the Government did implement several policies that have been brought up by the WP. But of course, the Government, being accountable to this House, has a duty to set its position clearly on suggestions made in this House and articulate its reasons should it not take up the suggestions.This is Parliamentary democracy at work. This is what our people expect.In the same vein, for the purposes of establishing common ground which the President has identified in her address to be an important aspect of our work in this House, it would be good for hon Members from Opposition parties to also entrench the policy of acknowledging, where appropriate, where they feel to be good ideas emanating from the Government. This approach entrenches the shared goal of advancing the larger public interest even as we acknowledge that the political process naturally involves a level of contestation.A great example of this happened just a few hours ago, when hon Member Mr Dennis Tan congratulated MOT and MPA for launching an electronic harbour launch recently, thereby reducing carbon dioxide emissions.Sir, I now turn my third and final point. From the debate, it is noteworthy that there is broad agreement to the Government\\'s plans as articulated by the President to secure our nation\\'s future. In my opening speech, I drew attention to the ambitious nature of these plans. They involve high levels of creativity. I spent some time highlighting the broad spectrum of plans affecting everything, from defence to the economy to the environment, as well as the fact that a long-term view has to be taken to implement these plans. I therefore congratulate the Government for presenting these plans that have secured this broad agreement in this House.This, however, is merely the start. To an extent, this may be the easier part of the process. Collectively, we need to secure the all-important buy-in of fellow Singaporeans to make the plans work for the benefit of Singapore and Singaporeans. Whilst this is not an easy task, there is every reason to be confident, in my personal view.This is where what the President stated in her address about moving forward with confidence becomes relevant. She said: \"We are now in a much stronger position – better poised to overcome our vulnerabilities and armed with crucial resources to push forward with confidence, however stormy the weather. Our collective experiences have strengthened the mutual trust between Singaporeans and their confidence in our system of Government. This virtuous circle relies on us partnering one another and working together to make the impossible, possible.\"I therefore call on all Members of this House, on both sides of the aisle, backbenchers and frontbenchers, to double down and work together to build happiness, prosperity and progress for our people. [Applause.]Resolved,\"That the following Address in reply to the Speech of the President be agreed to:\\'We, the Parliament of the Republic of Singapore, express our thanks to the President for the Speech which she delivered on behalf of the Government at the Opening of the Second Session of this Parliament.\\'.\"',\n",
       " \"I thank the hon Member Mr Murali Pillai for that question. What I had said and I will repeat that here, is that if you go back to those debates in Parliament in 2018, we opposed a hike of GST from 7% to 9%. At no point in that debate did we call for the GST to be lowered from 7% to 0%. Mr Pillai makes reference to positions that were articulated by the WP in the 1990s. I do not know whether it is fair to bring up positions that were taken in the 1990s and have a debate about that. By the same token, I could bring up positions that the People's Action Party (PAP) has taken in the 1990s and table that for discussion here, such as the Graduate Mother's Policy, such as votes for upgrading, for example. So, I think the point here is that at no point since the idea of a GST hike from 7% to 9% was first mooted and put on the table here in Parliament, which is in 2018 as I recall, at no point did anyone in the WP call for the GST to be lowered from 7% to 0%. And if there is anyone or if there is any evidence or reference that the Member can make, for anyone in the WP making that specific call, then we would be glad to discuss that. Mr Speaker: Mr Pillai. \",\n",
       " 'I thank the hon Member Mr Perera for clarifying that the acceptance of the stance of GST being at 7% is to be implied from the fact that in 2018, when it was proposed by the Government to increase the GST from 7% to 9%, the WP did not ask for a reduction of the percentage. Just on a point of elucidation, GST was not being increased for the first time in 2018. It was actually being increased progressively from 3% to 4% to 5%. And, in around 2007, it was increased from 5% to 7%. So, I take it that as far as my learned friend, or rather, the hon Member Mr Perera is concerned, this implicit decision to accept GST was made in 2018 when the Government conveyed its decision to propose an increase of GST from 7% to 9%. And if that is the case, then I think we have a happy situation because the gulf, or the gap, between the WP and the PAP is now narrowed from 9% to now 2%.Mr Speaker: Mr Perera.',\n",
       " 'I thank again Mr Perera for his answers. And maybe, Your Honour, if I could clarify, my interest in relation to raising the position of the WP from the 1990s is, with respect, not unfair because what we need is clarity on where the WP – and, for that reason, any party – stands on important issues. So, if it, indeed, had evolved, then it will be incumbent on any party to then make that position very clear, so that the public understands where the parties are on these important issues.Mr Speaker: I am honoured, Mr Murali. But this is not a Court. Mr Dennis Tan.',\n",
       " 'I thank the hon Member for his statements and, just to reiterate, when this idea of GST was mooted, we did not call for any reduction of the GST rate from 7% to 0%. So, that is, indeed, the position, and that would be borne out if you go back to those debates from 2018 until now. I would again remind the Member with respect that if we are to bring up policy positions that have been taken decades ago and table them for debate, then I think the policies of the PAP from decades ago should also be put here and tabled for debate as well. But I do not think that that would be constructive because everyone evolves their position as conditions evolve. And I think for us in the WP, and it may be the same for the PAP, whenever we have to make a decision on whether to take a position on a policy, you look at all the options that are there on the table and you decide what is in the best interest of the country, what is rational, what is fact-based, and you take a position at that point in time on that particular issue. But I thank the Member for his comments.Mr Speaker: Mr Pillai.  ',\n",
       " 'Mr Speaker, I support the Motion of Thanks to the President for her address during the Opening of the second session of the 14th Parliament.Mr Speaker, we read in the news this week that the Certificate of Entitlement (COE) premium for smaller cars crossed the $100,000 mark to reach a record high of $103,721. New records were also set in the larger car and open categories at $120,889 and $124,501 respectively. And I read that the latter is the highest price ever posted for any category of COEs.The President of the Singapore Vehicle Traders Association, Mr Neo Tiam Ting, told The Straits Times that the companies that are supplying cars for ride hailing services are a key driver behind the demand for COEs in recent years. He said that these companies which grow their fleets aggressively and pushed up COE premiums in the process are able to pass on the higher cost in the form of relatively small increases in daily rental rates while private buyers have to stomach the premium hike in one go with a bigger loan.This is not a new issue and I am aware that the Government stated in a Parliamentary Question reply to my colleague, the hon Louis Chua, last year that there is no evidence that PHC companies have caused the increase in COE prices. Be that as it may, as prices spiral out of reach of many Singaporeans who aspire or need to buy a car for different reasons, can we not do more to review how we can ensure that businesses, whether ride-hailing companies, car leasing companies or car dealers, do not push up the COE premiums at the peril of private buyers who need to buy a car for various different reasons.Such reasons can include using their vehicles for work purposes, taking care of their families with young children, taking care of elderly family members or handicapped family members. For some of these people, operating a private hire car from a ride-hailing company or using Grab or taxis may somehow not be a suitable substitute.Can we also see to it that COEs for commercial vehicles are not subject to similar pressures? The rising COEs for this Category C have contributed to rising business costs and present further challenges for our smaller businesses. And added business costs also contribute to the increase in cost of living for everyone.In the past week, when we have been talking about combating stratification and building social compact amidst rising costs of living and rising property prices, we should be wary of the possible social effects of spiralling COE prices.Mr Speaker, I welcome and support the Minister for Transport\\'s statement in the addendum to the President\\'s Address, that the Ministry of Transport (MOT) will further encourage the adoption of cleaner energy vehicles through regulation, incentives and infrastructure. Indeed, President Halimah stated in her address that we have committed to decisive action to reduce carbon emissions and are taking resolute steps towards meeting our net-zero commitments.The Minister also said that we will review financial incentives to encourage the adoption of electric cars and monitor related developments in other vehicle segments, such as motorcycles and goods vehicles. To date, the pricing of electric vehicles is still relatively unattractive, compared to internal combustible engine (ICE) vehicles. I agree that the Government should further review to see how we are better able to encourage and incentivise more people to switch to Electric Vehicles (EVs) and reducing the number of new ICE vehicles on the road.Mr Speaker, a recent CNA article dated 11 April 2023 reported that parallel importers face limits in what EVs they can put on the road as compared to the authorised dealers, as this is partly because of how road tax is calculated, which is pegged to the EV\\'s power rating. One importer reported encountering problems with the homologation and/or registration for EVs. It was also reported that EV models with dual electric motors require proper documentation from manufacturers that confirm their power rating and this makes it tougher for parallel importers to register these cars for road use as, unlike authorised dealers, they do not have direct contact with the car makers. Another importer stated that EV options are quite limited for parallel importers and they hope for, I quote, \"better support in terms of clarity on importing rules\".I hope the Government can look into the concerns of these parallel importers to clarify and review the rules and documentary requirements for EV sales and registrations, which may be more disadvantageous to parallel importers. More importantly, I hope the Government can provide more assistance to parallel importers to encourage them to focus on getting higher volumes of EV sales as opposed to ICE vehicles.Mr Speaker, still on transition to EVs, I next move to the issue of the electrification of logistics vehicles. In my Budget debate speech in February this year, I expressed my concern that it remains unclear how soon certain logistics fleets, including but not limited to light goods vehicles, will be switching to EVs entirely and I said that a number of prominent logistics companies have not yet had any plans or have not announced any plans for EV conversion or some have preliminary plans for only limited initial conversion.Indeed, I have brought up my concerns for the green transition in last-mile logistics and asking for our plans for conversion of goods and logistics vehicles variously in the Committee of Supply (COS) Debate 2022 with the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, and during the debate for the EV Charging Bill in November 2022. In the MOT COS debate last month, I also asked whether the Government will actively engage logistics companies directly on their plans to convert to EVs and to speed up the process.Senior Minister of State Amy Khor replied that, and I quote: \"on logistics companies\\' transition to cleaner vehicles, we are working with them, but it is now limited by the availability of this kind of vehicles in terms of technology\".Sir, during the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE)\\'s COS debate in 2022, I have already said that we have also seen electric light commercial vehicle models increasingly being rolled out by manufacturers, such as Renault, Opel and BYD. More recently, we read that, in the US, Schneider has delivered its first short-haul logistics EV trucks while Tesla has also delivered EV trucks to PepsiCo.Mr Speaker, while I appreciate MOT\\'s efforts to engage our logistics companies in this area thus far and, admittedly, some manufacturers may have only started to build such electric commercial vehicles not too long ago. I hope the MOT will increase its engagement with logistics companies to persuade them to have step plans for the conversions. I hope MOT will have a dedicated roadmap on the conversion of the logistics and goods vehicle fleet operating in Singapore in the next few years and will work closely together with logistics companies on such a roadmap.Mr Speaker, during the EV Charging Bill debate in November last year, I also mentioned that we have a large number of goods vehicles which are coming from Malaysia on a daily basis. I hope the Government will have a plan to handle this large group of foreign ICE vehicles coming into Singapore and travelling all over Singapore every day even if this may take even more time, given that they are foreign vehicles. Yes, we may need the goods and supplies these goods vehicles bring in every day, but it will be good to know that the Government has a plan in respect of these vehicles even if it may involve foreign government or agencies. We should not let their emissions delay our zero emission goals indefinitely.Mr Speaker, I also like to congratulate MOT and Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) for the launch of the first electric ferry, the Penguin Refresh on Monday, to carry Shell workers, contractors and visitors between Shell\\'s Pulau Bukom premises and Pasir Panjang Ferry Terminal.It is also commendable that MPA is working with Shell to allow other electric harbour craft to access their electric charges in due course. This is a first big step in the decarbonisation of the harbour craft fleet in the Port of Singapore. Under MPA\\'s maritime decarbonisation blueprint working towards 2050, all harbour craft will operate on low carbon energy solutions such as blended biofuels, for example, the B100 fuel or hybrid diesel electric propulsion by 2030 and by 2050 will operate on full electric propulsion of net zero fuels in order to achieve 15% reduction of 2021 levels by 2030 and 50% of 2021 levels by 2050.I support these plans and I hope we can achieve the targets ahead of time.In the course of my professional work over the years, I had to use harbour launches to board vessels lying in nearby anchorages over the years and I hope the familiar smell of the engine fuel of the old harbour launches will be a thing of the past. In fact, I can remember in the past, I would have to pick one of the many harbour launches lying alongside Clifford Pier, effectively like water taxis and the pierced smelling of the fumes.Mr Speaker, while it is noteworthy that Shell estimates that it can save more than 6,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year, the ferry operation is far from being the mainstay of Shell\\'s business.In my Budget debate\\'s speech on 2022, I mentioned that Shell had in November 2021 announced that it was halving its crude processing capacity at its Singapore hub and reducing fuel exports. The oil major, a major part of our oil and gas industry, is intending to transit from fossil fuels to cut emissions and meet global low carbon energy needs. I acknowledge that this is part of a wider global trend in a transition towards low carbon fuels and undoubtedly, will affect Singapore in some ways.Mr Speaker, I hope the Government will continue to update the House on the transformation of our petrochemical sector on a green transition process in this sector, whether Singapore will continue to attract and retain parts of the petrochemical industry in Singapore. They are relevant for the green economy. I hope the Government will provide updates on our efforts in attracting more businesses in areas like biofuel refining or sustainable aviation fuel production or storage for such fuels as well as updates on carbon capture and sequestration at petrochemical plants.And finally, I hope the Government will continue to update the House on the just transition in manpower for our workers working in Shell and other companies in the petrochemical sector, what we are doing to retain and retrain workers in this sector as the sector transforms within Singapore. Mr Speaker, I support the Motion of thanks to the President.Mr Speaker: Mr Pritam Singh.',\n",
       " 'Mr Speaker, the Government\\'s direction as encapsulated by the President\\'s Address continues in the same vein from the last term of Parliament. A significant part of the information contained in the addenda to the President\\'s Address has been made known previously even before Parliament was prorogued. The WP Members of Parliament (MPs) have therefore raised issues that remain at the top of the public mind, such as HDB matters, the cost of living issues that affect seniors and the young and matters of fairness and inclusivity.For my part, I will cover three broad points.First, I will speak about foreigners in Singapore and restate my call to the Government to ensure that our foreign talent policies translate to tangible benefits for Singaporeans.Secondly, I will revisit my call for proficiency in English as a requirement for new Permanent Residents (PRs) and new citizens.Third, I will address the Deputy Prime Minister\\'s remarks on the WP as an opposition that seeks to chip away at the people\\'s trust in Government. I will also address the Deputy Prime Minister\\'s questions to the WP concerning the Goods and Services Tax and list several policy proposals made by the WP, which have been adopted by the Government.First, foreigners in Singapore. WP MPs know from our engagement with the public that a unique Singapore identity – proud and distinctive – has formed but continues to evolve. Insofar as a new social compact is concerned, Singaporeans seek a fairer, more inclusive and more caring society. The Government recognises this and my colleagues have signposted areas where these objectives can be operationalised.In his addendum, the Minister in-charge of the Strategy Group under the Prime Minister\\'s Office, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence has committed to carefully manage foreign worker and immigration flows to ensure that these translate into tangible benefits for Singaporeans and separately, to help newcomers integrate better into society.With respect to tangible benefits for Singaporeans, the WP has made that specific point repeatedly and we continue to see it as an important requirement to ensure society remains welcoming of foreigners. The WP has also made calls for a report card on the Industry Transformation Maps and job outcomes for Singaporeans. The publication of outcome-based indicators of Government policies would be useful tools in ensuring continued public support or at least understanding of the Government\\'s foreign talent policies. Providing evidence of how foreign talent policies help Singaporeans in concrete ways will help prevent xenophobia, something we must always guard against.To this end, it is useful for me to restate the point the WP made on the Parliamentary debate on free trade agreements and the India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) in September 2021, a point that Minister Ong Ye Kung brought up yesterday. As that debate proved, getting the People\\'s Action Party (PAP) Government to reveal information on the number of intra-corporate transferees from India that worked in Singapore upon the introduction of CECA was like squeezing blood out of a stone.Parliamentary questions had been filed by the WP on the issue from 2016 but forthright answers were not forthcoming. In the meantime, pressures and tensions on the ground built up as a small number of Singaporeans became emotionally charged about CECA, using it as an adjective and in very uncharitable and downright racist ways. The WP sought information, answers to which could have shed light and reduced heat before things reached a boiling point. Unlike as suggested by Minister Ong yesterday, sometimes filing a parliamentary question does not guarantee receiving an adequate and substantive answer from the PAP Government from which alternatives can germinate.Moving forward another potential tinder box that the Government should look at closely is the growth of family offices, inflows of foreign wealth and how Singaporeans are taking to these developments. There are already murmurings of discontent that are led by emotional perspectives, created by facts such as the mass buying spree of properties in single developments by foreigners. If the Government does not step in early and fill the information vacuum on how outcomes for Singapore and Singaporeans are enhanced, this subject may turn ugly too and it would be important for the Government to be on top of this.In future, the PAP must not see calls for information as a Trojan horse for ulterior motives or a red herring. When there are requests for detailed figures, the PAP must not turn defensive in response to the Parliamentary Opposition of the day playing its role checking the Government of the day.In moving this Motion, MP Mr Murali Pillai stated that we must recognise that the nature of the electorate is changing and today, a new generation is emerging – standing taller and brighter than the ones before. He also said, and I quote, \"People\\'s psyche will change and as they do, the Government must change to a degree and at a speed unprecedented.\" Likewise, the interventions of the Opposition in this House, the questions it asks and the proposals it advances must reflect this new psyche.Going forward, the 4G PAP Leadership cannot be dismissive or breezily use national security or sensitivity as reasons for withholding information without good reason. In fact, I foresee that a greater openness to releasing information will be fundamental to the refreshed social compact that the 4G Leadership seeks to forge with Singaporeans through the Forward Singapore exercise. On the point of the Prime Minister\\'s Office\\'s Strategy Group\\'s addendum covering better integration of newcomers into society, I had proposed an English requirement for PRs and citizenship applications in last month\\'s Committee of Supply debate. A few weeks later, in a demographically representative poll of 500 Singapore-born citizens aged between 18 and 69, a CNA MediaCorp survey reported on 3 April this year, this month by CNA found that almost 80% were in favour of an English test for new PRs and citizens.Prior to the release of the survey result, in some limited quarters, the proposal for an English requirement was incorrectly understood as a divisive one with the implicit point being that mother tongue languages would somehow be compromised or that an English requirement was actually a test for \"Singaporeaness\". But these criticisms missed the key point of the proposal, which was focused on integration. I am gratified that the demographically representative survey respondents did not miss the point.The wide support for an English requirement, as shown by the survey, can perhaps be traced to the historical use of English in Singapore, as established by the Pioneer Generation of PAP leaders. In the 2012 publication, Singapore\\'s Bilingual Journey, the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew said, and I quote, \"When Singapore celebrated its 21st National Day on the 9th of August 1986, it also celebrated a different sort of milestone. It was the first-time emcees of the event used English to lead the audience, where before they had to use three languages – Mandarin, Malay and Tamil. The crowds, likewise, responded in English. Where before the different races in Singapore were like different tanks of fish in an aquarium together before your eyes but segregated from one another, now they have a common language linking them together. They still retained their mother tongues whether Chinese, Malay or Tamil? But a common knowledge of English enabled them to share together the joys of the occasion. I was a proud man that day.\"On the occasion of the 100th year of his birth, this year, those words of the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew are timely. The late Prime Minister was clear. English would be a functional language with which to access the knowledge of the world and a tool for survival. The mother tongue is the cultural language used to transmit the culture\\'s traditional values. More than three decades since his words in 1986, Singaporeans understand that immigration is necessary to top up our population but they also instinctively appreciate the importance of a lingua franca for better integration with newcomers and the signal it sends of Singapore as a multi-racial and multicultural nation not just in form, but in substance. So, no one should be surprised at advocacy for our lingua franca, namely English, to bind Singaporeans together. At the same time, however, we must never sever our cultural roots. All of us must remain proud and celebrate our individual cultures, including our mother tongues.One legitimate concern, however, is the possible difficulty of an English requirement for foreign spouses who apply for PR or citizenship. Sir, WP – in its 2020 manifesto – called for the fast-track naturalisation of foreign spouses on the Long-Term Visit Pass Plus (LVTP+), subject to certain conditions, such as having at least one Singaporean child. I would suggest that an English requirement for foreign spouses can be one of the criteria for fast-tracking these applicants. My proposal calls for, all other things being equal, that additional points or consideration be given for PR and citizenship to foreign spouses who have a working proficiency in English. As the Government has openly stated, our immigration policy and immigration intake is calibrated to preserve the racial balance and by extension, an English requirement would not favour one racial group over another just because applicants in one racial group already use English and the other does not. Sir, a fast-track for foreign spouses would give families in Singapore with one Singaporean spouse much peace of mind. In effect, for foreign spouses, the English requirement would serve as a plus one criteria or bonus criteria. It would nudge and better align immigration policy with our bilingualism policy, which is a fundamental aspect of the Singapore system. For the record, this WP proposal does not contradict any of the eight principles of Singapore\\'s bilingualism policy established by the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew.Mr Speaker, the Singaporean identity continues to mature. For a young nation, this is a positive force. One that instinctively drives us towards inclusivity. It is wholly consistent with the values professed by the Government\\'s agenda that seeks, and I quote, \"a deepening of Singaporeans\\' sense of shared identity and mutual responsibility towards one another\".I hope the Government can explore the best ways to reinforce the importance of English as a common language in our daily life, as it makes a big difference to the lived experience of many Singaporeans. The signalling effect on the centrality of our multiracial and multicultural society is immense. Sir, let me move on to my third point. I did not expect the Deputy Prime Minister to use his speech on the President\\'s Address to attack and accuse the WP of advancing opportunistic or populist ideas to chip away, bit by bit, the trust in Government. The PAP shifted its position yesterday in the course of the debate. when Minister Ong Ye Kung conceded that the WP have brought up many good ideas. But both Ministers were consistent in calling for the Opposition to present an alternative agenda and even an alternative Budget. I will deal with this point in the course of my speech.To address Deputy Prime Minister Wong, if all we were doing was putting forward populist, unrealistic policies, we would not see the Government actively considering some variation of the WP manifesto ideas on anti-discrimination legislation, minimum wage and redundancy insurance. If chipping away at trust in the Government was our real agenda, we would not see the Minister for National Development (MND) acknowledging the WP point highlighting the inherent inequity of the Housing and Development Board (HDB) taxpayer subsidies as currently applied between mature and non-mature Build-to-Order (BTO) flats.It is a most unfair charge levelled at the WP which, in reality, chips away at the integrity of our Parliamentary democracy as an important platform for the exposition and contestation of ideas. In fact, we welcome the PAP taking up WP points because the real beneficiaries are not the WP or the PAP – but the people of Singapore. Mr Speaker, please allow me to list just a few of our policy proposals to demolish this idea that the WP has not put forward serious alternatives. Number one, verifying educational qualifications of Employment Pass (EP) holders. In our 2020 General Election manifesto, we called for the introduction of Employment Pass credentials assessment. We said that all Employment Pass and S Pass job applicants with university degrees and diplomas should be subject to mandatory educational credentials assessments, with cost to be borne by the applicant. On 1 March this year, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) announced that companies in Singapore would need to verify the educational qualifications of Employment Pass applicants from 1 September 2023.Number two, broadcast Parliamentary Sittings live. In our 2020 and 2015 General Election manifestos, we called for the live, unedited broadcasts of Parliamentary Sittings. From 4 January 2021, Singaporeans were able to view livestreamed sessions of Parliament.Number three, national hydrogen strategy. Aljunied Group Representation Constituency (GRC) Member of Parliament (MP) Gerald Giam called for a national renewable hydrogen strategy in Parliament in January 2022 during the Motion on a low carbon society and again during Budget 2020. On 25 October the same year, the Energy Market Authority (EMA) announced that Singapore was launching a national hydrogen strategy to accelerate the transition to net zero emissions and to strengthen energy security.Number four, equalised maternity leave of 16 weeks for single unwed mothers. In our 2011 and 2015 General Election manifestos, we called for equitable support for single parents. In our 2011 manifesto, we stated that while having children outside of marriage should continue to be discouraged in our society, children born to single parents should not be denied the benefits that children of married parents receive. The children are innocent parties and should not start life being disadvantaged. We said that single parents should receive the same parenthood benefit packages as married parents.In our 2015 manifesto, we reiterate our call to grant single and wet mothers the full 16 weeks of paid maternity leave. In addition, we argue that single mothers should be made eligible for both the Working Mother\\'s Child Relief (WCMR) as well as the Foreign Domestic Worker Levy (FDWL) relief. Excluding single mothers from these schemes unnecessarily penalises vulnerable children and single mothers. We added that the Government should extend the same help to single fathers. On 9 November 2016, the Government announced that from January 2017, unmarried mothers would have 16 weeks of paid maternity leave, equal to their married counterparts and fathers would have two weeks of paid paternity leave.Number five, BTO priority and forfeiture for non-selection. In our 2015 General Election manifesto, we called for the \"three-tries BTO\". We proposed that first-timer BTO applicants on the fiancé-fiancée scheme be given priority up to their third try in selecting a flat so as to minimise the waiting time for couples to buy a flat and plan for starting a family. We called for the priority to be forfeited if the first timer BTO applicants were invited to select a flat in any one of their previous tries but did not book a flat.On 2 March this year, the Government announced that first-time BTO applicants who give up their chance to select a flat would lose their priority status. From the August 2023 BTO exercise, first timers who fail to choose a flat once will be deemed second timers for a year in the computer ballot. Second timers who accumulate one non-selection count, down from the current two counts, will have to wait one year before they can apply for flat again.Number six, impose a charge for the use of plastic bags. In our 2020 General Election manifesto on curbing the use of plastics, we called for the introduction of a single-use plastic charge, phased in over five years to encourage a reduction in plastic waste while looking for alternatives. This is what we said: the value of the charge would need to be sufficiently high to change behaviours but remains sensitive to the needs of lower socioeconomic groups and persons with disabilities. We called for a nationwide public education campaign to raise awareness of the effects of single-use plastics and other more sustainable alternatives. On 2 March this year, the Government announced a plastic charge at most Singapore supermarkets from 3 July 2023, with two-thirds of all supermarkets imposing a charge of at least five cents for each carrier bag.Number seven, one family paired to one General Practitioner (GP). In our 2015 General Election manifesto seven years ago, the WP called for the family doctor pairing scheme. We argue that pairing families with GPs would encourage patients to remain with one family doctor who would be more familiar with their background and medical history. This would facilitate earlier detection of illnesses, provide more accurate diagnosis, reduce duplication of treatment and improve coordination with other care providers. We proposed all resident families be paired with a GP near their home and that Singaporeans could be given the option to change their assigned GP. In October 2022, this House debated the Healthier SG White Paper, which among other things put forward the Government\\'s proposal for one family physician and one health plan for everyone. Under the plan, each resident chooses the family doctor or clinic. Flexibility will be provided for residents to change their enrolled doctor if they need to do so.Number eight, flexible work arrangements. In our 2015 General Election manifesto seven years ago again, the WP called for the fair regulation of mandatory flexi-work arrangements, where companies should be obliged to cater for a work-life friendly environment for workers. We suggested that employees who work for a company with more than 20 employees for more than six months should be allowed to make requests for flexible working arrangements. Employers could refuse the request on reasonable business grounds but must discuss the options available with the employee. The discussion must be duly documented and employees may appeal the refusal if there is a dispute on the grounds for refusing a request. We also called for tax breaks and enhanced work-life grants to be made widely available to help companies accommodate the flexi-work arrangements relevant to their respective industries. In the course of this debate no less, Minister of State Gan Siow Huang has reiterated that to entrench flexible work arrangements, MOM and the Tripartite Partners will introduce a set of tripartite guidelines by 2024. The guidelines would require employers to consider requests for flexible work arrangements fairly and properly. Sir, this is a non-exhaustive listing of the WP\\'s alternative proposals. There are of course proposals that were long advanced by the WP MPs, for example, on criminal legal aid which was strenuously rejected by the PAP. For example, on criminal legal aid, the PAP\\'s long-standing position was that it could not accept the taxpayer simultaneously funding both the prosecution and criminal defence. But they shifted positions and criminal legal aid finally became a reality in the last session of Parliament. When the WP raised the matter of anti-discrimination laws and redundancy insurance, the PAP similarly offered many reasons why it could not be done then or were unmoved and not persuaded, only to shift its position later and take up the suggestion. One specific point which the Deputy Prime Minister reopened in this debate was the GST and the WP\\'s approach to it. This is rather strange because the debate over the last few years has been about the GST hike and not the GST per se.Even so, as the Deputy Prime Minister spoke on Monday, I wondered why the Deputy Prime Minister would want to raise the GST question at this debate because those questions ought to have come during the Budget debate. Had the question on the WP position on the GST per se been asked then, the answer would have been obvious. The WP policy positions cannot be immutable and have to evolve with the political realities of the time. We may not have supported the GST when it was first introduced decades ago but we recognise it as part of the system. But accepting the GST as it stands does not mean accepting every GST hike put forward by the Government. The WP went into the last general elections opposing the hike in the GST. We did not ask for the removal of the GST completely since the GST has been an endemic feature about tax system for many years now. At least from the time I entered this House, the WP\\'s position concerned the necessity of GST hikes because the GST hurts the poor and middle class the hardest.Mr Speaker, Singaporeans know that no GST offset package lasts forever. Singaporeans are also acutely aware that a 1% increase in GST this year does not mean that the prices of goods and services will only rise by 1%. As we all know, for the men and women on the street the rise can be compounded many times, especially for basic things. Even with the Government\\'s newly enhanced permanent GSTV scheme in 2022 by MOF\\'s own reckoning, for low-income households who do not have elderly members, the GSTV scheme will offset about half of their total GST expenses. I am aware that in February this year, the GSTV cash component of the GSTV scheme was increased by up to $350. However, I have not been able to find an MOF statement that sets out in parallel how much this increase will offset the total GST expenses for a low-income family without elderly members.Sir, the WP\\'s view is that if there are options to stave off this 1% or 2% rise in GST to fend off concomitant price rises in basic things like food at the coffee shop or hawker centre for the men and women on the street, as a responsible Opposition that has the welfare of Singaporeans at heart, the WP has to ask – why not consider them? And debate them? That is what we must be expected to do in this House rather than just accept whatever the PAP says.The Deputy Prime Minister does not want the WP to relitigate the alternative ideas we raised to make up the GST hike by saying that the sums do not add up. I believe when he says this, he means the sums do not add up if you want to remove the GST completely.But the Deputy Prime Minister would be acutely aware that this House was never debating the total removal of the GST in the last session of the Parliament, nor have we been doing so as long as the Deputy Prime Minister has been in this House.This is a distraction and the PAP should be upfront about it since we have been clearly talking about the GST hike from 7% to 9%, and what alternatives there are for it. I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether the Government still intends to proceed with the GST hike from 8% to 9% next year or whether it would consider a pause in view of persisting inflationary and cost of living pressures; and secondly, to accommodate changes to our corporate tax receipts that will inevitably crystalise further in the wake of BEPS 2.0. This is especially since the Government has announced at this year\\'s Budget that it would implement a domestic top-up tax that will raise multinational enterprise groups\\' effective tax rate in Singapore to 15% in 2025 – less than two years from now.Should the corporate tax revenues look respectable and sustainable for the short to medium term without any real compromise in our attractiveness to foreign investors, it may not be necessary to introduce another hike to the GST from 8% to 9% for 2024, if corporate tax revenue, which contribute 25% of our tax revenues today, goes up further.Sir, the WP\\'s interventions, including our proposals of alternatives to the GST hike, seek better outcomes for Singaporeans. If our agenda was rank opportunism or populism, as suggested by the Deputy Prime Minister, the people will reject our brand of politics. But many Singaporeans do not want the cause of the Opposition in Singapore to fail and instinctively recognise the importance of a rational, responsible and respectable political Opposition in this House. For that reason, the public expectations of the outcomes in General Elections are not necessarily in synchrony with Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong\\'s point that every election from now will be about who forms the government.What the Deputy Prime Minister is true in a theoretical sense. The elections are about who forms the government. But as the PAP itself likes to tout, Singapore is unique. The political reality in the Singaporean context – a combination of the first-past-the-post system, the size and footprint of Opposition parties, certain grassroots organisations\\' manned by PAP apparatchiks and an Electoral Boundaries Review Committee that comes under the Prime Minister\\'s Office, amongst other factors – all these reveal that the real prospect for a change of government during General Elections today, conceals the advantage of the PAP\\'s incumbency far more than the Deputy Prime Minister cares to let Singaporeans in on.The Deputy Prime Minister has asked us to be honest about our plans, policies and intentions. On the heady dreams of displacing the PAP and forming the government, the reality is the WP is a small party and we have a long way to go. Our medium-term objective is to ensure that one third of the seats in this House are not in the PAP\\'s hands. I said this in 2018 in a speech to WP\\'s members, which is publicly available under the \"Key Speeches\" section of the Office of the Leader of the Opposition website, and this was reported by the mainstream media.Why the significance of this figure of one-third and why is it important?The Constitution – the highest law of our land – which all other laws must take reference from, can only be changed if two-thirds of the MPs in this House agree. Should any political party with more than two thirds of the seats in this House decide to change the Constitution arbitrarily, there is nothing that can be done to stop them. Today, the PAP does not just have a two-third majority, it has a supermajority of more than 75% of the seats. If we exclude Nominated MPs who cannot vote on constitutional changes, the total denominator is 93 elected MPs and two Non-constituency MPs. That brings the PAP\\'s supermajority at close to 90% today.We are not playing \"masak masak\" when we make changes to the Constitution. These are serious matters that involve the lives of Singaporeans to a very acute degree. In order to pass a constitutional amendment with a two-third majority, the PAP needs 63 votes in this House. The PAP has 83 MPs today. The PAP can even change the entire Constitution at one go, with 20 MPs to spare.Let me give an illustration of how and why these numbers are important.On 21 March this year, just last month – in fact, exactly one month ago – the Parliament passed amendments to the Constitution. Some of the changes included amendments to Article 9, that sought to ensure that laws relating to the misuse of drugs that authorise the arrest and detention of any person for treatment and rehabilitation, remain valid under the Constitution. A separate change involved the introduction of a legal mechanism to reduce the balance of the Contingencies Fund so as to maintain discipline in how the Government manages its finances.Unbeknownst to many members of the public and voters, there were only 67 MPs in the House present when that constitutional amendment was passed on 21 March last month. These 67 MPs included seven WP MPs.If all the WP MPs had not been present in the House at the time of the vote, the Constitution could not have been amended as sought by the PAP as only 60 PAP MPs were present. I want to emphasise that the WP\\'s intention is not to block all the changes to the Constitution proposed by a PAP Government. Far from it. If constitutional amendments are in the interest of our people. we will support them. But if we assessed that the proposed changes to the Constitution are detrimental to Singapore and Singaporeans, we will speak against them and vote against them.Voting against Constitutional amendments is not something that PAP MPs will be able to do if their party whip is not lifted. They can talk all they like in this House and go to the ends of the earth claiming to make a principled stand, but they cannot vote other than how the PAP leadership dictates.Sir, the WP seeks an evolution of Singapore\\'s politics towards a permanent presence of elected Opposition MPs so as to ensure sufficient balance in our political system against an extraordinarily dominant PAP. We do not seek a revolution that includes a change of government at this stage of Singapore\\'s political development. Based on my reading, this view is consistent with the general public\\'s sentiment.But the PAP should not rest on its laurels because this can change and it is because of that question that has been asked before – what if a rogue government sprang from the bosom of the PAP?The PAP knows that as long as the WP is not in government, it will never have the full breadth of considerations and access to detail the PAP is privy to – Cabinet briefings and papers, access to hundreds of classified public surveys and, of course, the intellectual and operational engine of the Civil Service. So, the Deputy Prime Minister demands that we come up with a serious alternative agenda and an alternative budget at this stage, knowing that there is a more than likely chance we will inevitably fall short on details, owing to obvious information asymmetries. And come election time, the PAP can tell the public that no serious alternatives have been presented. But where we have alternative ideas, we have advanced them. We will continue to do so, in spite of the political realities. We have been open with Singaporeans and nailed our flag to the mast in the course of campaigning for the people\\'s votes to put us in Parliament. Our manifestos have not been an amalgamation of broad statements of purpose and glossy pictures, but specific proposals with a view to better the lives of Singaporeans. If these proposals that I have highlighted earlier were not serious, why did the PAP take them on board and devote fiscal resources to fund them and policy resources to implement them?At its core, Mr Speaker, respectfully, what the Deputy Prime Minister has to appreciate is that the public expectations of the WP in Parliament as elected MPs differ from the PAP\\'s expectations from the WP – and rightly so. For many Singaporeans, the key operative consideration in making their vote count goes far beyond and transcends just a change of government. There are real political questions the voters have to consider, which they are acutely aware of.Firstly, Singaporeans want an Opposition to check the PAP because in their heart of hearts, we all know that \"ownself check ownself\" is not realistic. The inherent nature of power makes this unrealistic. Secondly, it is in our collective self-interest that no one party can amend the Constitution – the highest law of our land – at will. So, it is wise to have at least one third of this House in a party or parties other than the PAP.Thirdly, in the same vein as the Prime Minister alluded to in his speech in this debate, Singapore\\'s future is not a given. It follows that no one can ignore the possibility of a rogue government springing from the bosom of the PAP. Our people should have real political options if or when that happens.These are the reasons why there should be a strong Opposition presence in this House even before we talk of a change of government, alternative agendas and alternative budgets. In fact, PAP MP Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim said in the course of this debate, \"Iron sharpens iron. The rigours of debates and contestation of ideas on issues that are important to Singaporeans can help all of us formulate new ways forward for Singapore.\" He could not have put it better.At some point, in the name of inclusivity and a united Singapore in the face of grave external challenges, I hope the PAP can rise above political partisanship and acknowledge the political contribution of the WP towards the betterment of Singapore and Singaporeans.In conclusion, Mr Speaker, just as the President has set out the direction the Government is taking, let me set out the approach of the WP for this second session of Parliament of the Government\\'s term. The WP\\'s approach involves an acceptance that the political reality in Singapore is the overwhelming dominance of the PAP today. Part of that PAP\\'s supremacy comes from the performance of the PAP in delivering what citizens want, especially in the early decades of Singapore\\'s self rule, then Independence. Part of that dominance has also come from hardball political tactics that also hosted policies with collateral purposes that suppressed the growth of an Opposition such as politicising ostensibly community-focused organisations such as the People\\'s Association, which does the bidding of even unelected advisors.What is the appropriate response to such dominance? Some believe, perhaps naively, that it is best to work within the system, to change things from within the establishment.Is that a realistic possibility? Perhaps it is. If you make it to one of a handful of top positions. But even the late President Ong Teng Cheong, who was very close to the top of PAP politics as deputy prime minister and seemingly right at the top of our political hierarchy as President, could not get the information he wanted. How much less realistic then for those lower down the establishment\\'s pecking order to achieve substantive goals for change?The alternative in responding to PAP\\'s dominance is to appeal directly to the people – by contesting in elections and leaving it to the voters and having faith in their judgement. This is the path the WP, its MPs, members and volunteers have chosen. So, the direction the WP must take while in Parliament is to worthy of the votes that have put us in Parliament. Just as the Government is essentially continuing its last term and also the previous session of Parliament, so are we. We will continue to raise alternative proposals within the limits of our resources and the information we have or is made available.We will be glad to see the PAP implement policies we have suggested, whether they say that those ideas were already in their pipeline or whether they merely adopt them without attribution. But most critically, no matter the challenge or obstacle, the Opposition must be focused and continue to endeavour, work for and defend the interests of Singaporeans and Singapore, as equal and fellow Singaporeans, together in the same boat, rowing in the same direction, be it in or out of this House. [Applause.]Mr Speaker: Minister Tan See Leng.',\n",
       " \"Mr Speaker, thank you. I would like to seek a point of clarification to Mr Pritam Singh's speech earlier on. In his speech, he said that asking the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) to release statistics is like drawing blood from a stone.I want to highlight the point that on his question on the number of intra-corporate transferees, on 6 July 2021, in the Ministerial Statement, I had already provided the numbers. There were 4,200 intra-corporate transferees working in Singapore the year before – that is, 2020 – a number that has remained consistently small. And, of course, the rest of it is available in the Hansard. It is also published in The Straits Times as well. I think the point to highlight to everyone, every Member of the House and particularly in response to your statement is that many of the questions that were asked – both by the WP as well as by the PSP – were not just on the numbers pertaining to intra- corporate transferees. But the Member has also put the questions together on the breakdown of whether the jobs went to Singapore Citizens who were born in Singapore or who were naturalised Singaporeans, amongst other types of confidential information that was not readily released.Notwithstanding that, in the interest of addressing the issue in Parliament, to the best extent that is possible, our MOM officials came up to put the statistics up required by MPs. I hope that we can have this social compact – and let us make no mistakes about it that the vitriol and the raw emotions at that particular point in time, I hope was really something that we should all try to avoid. And I hope that they were not due to other factors outside of what the questions were intended to be. And I hope that they were not due to deliberate efforts to frustrate our social compact. To the Member's point about the confidential information that could have been released earlier, I believe that it cannot be the reason for the ugly xenophobia, the racial undertones surrounding CECA. I think that is the point that I would like to clarify.Mr Speaker: Mr Singh. \",\n",
       " 'Thank you, Mr Speaker. Before I go into the nub of the matter as raised by the hon Minister for Manpower, in terms of the xenophobic elements which the Minister raised, we are at ad idem. We do not want our compact to be disrupted and overturned because of these reasons. So, to that extent, we are on the same page. But let me just share with the Minister that when I referred to the intra-corporate transferees, Minister would recall in the debate that Minister refers to, that the Parliamentary Questions were asked well before the answers that he gave in Parliament in July. Mr Leon Perera had – if my memory serves me correctly and I stand corrected, Mr Speaker, I am going based on memory alone – asked the question on the number of intra-corporate transferees in 2016. And the answer in Parliament from the Minister for Manpower was, \"we don\\'t reveal these numbers.\" And the point we were making – and the point I made in my speech again today – was if those numbers were released, because the numbers were low – they could have punctured all that xenophobia quite early. And the point I am making was I could not understand why it was difficult to provide the information in 2016. But then when things are descending into an abyss, the numbers start coming out.I made this point earlier. I made this point in the course of that debate and this was then Minister Ong Ye Kung\\'s reply. I made the same point and there is no real difference in the point that I am making now. And this is what he said in my response to releasing information earlier: \"I take to heart what the Leader of the Opposition has said that, with information, we can quell such falsehoods much earlier. We work in a bureaucracy. Some data is classified secret, confidential and so on. So, we are not at liberty to always disclose them. But what you say is true. Some information, it is better for it to come out early and then we can move on, especially as you said when it concerns issues like racism or xenophobia, it is much better to credit early.\"Sir, I hope that response addresses the point put to me by the Minister for Manpower. I am suggesting that in certain issues of great significance, the Government is better off providing more information rather than less. Mr Speaker: Minister Tan See Leng.',\n",
       " 'Mr Speaker, I actually did not intend to bring up this point in the course of my speech today. But because Minister Ong mentioned yesterday in the context of presenting alternative budgets, alternative agendas, he said, \"just file a question, you\\'ll get a written answer\". I think that caused me to pause. Because the answer that was given in 2016 – and again, I stand corrected if my memory fails me – was not that the reason we are not releasing the ICT data was because there could be commercial sensitivities and so forth. In fact, there was no reason given at all, if I am not wrong. It was \"We don\\'t release this figure, period\".So, again, I think the question really comes back down to thinking carefully about whether that information truly is going to be problematic and what is in our interests, given Singapore\\'s situation, given how some of these agreements can be problematic. And I have to add, again, I am going back six years. So, I remember the question of CECA did not just drop from the sky in 2015, 2016, 2017, around that period. Factually, the Government website, also had to come out and clarify some of these issues. So, in that context, I am not blaming MOM or pointing the finger at MOM, but making a larger meta point about how important it can be for information to be released and to take a different attitude towards it.Mr Speaker: Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.',\n",
       " \"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Let me just deal with the last point made by the hon Deputy Prime Minister. I do not think there is any difficulty for me or my colleagues to agree to that.And I think that coming back to the Prime Minister's speech, which I think a lot more Singaporeans should listen to, we know the future is not exactly smooth. There are a lot of unpredictable factors that we have to contend with and, in the course of debate in this House, we will be going back and forth at each other's proposals and ideas.But insofar as populism and opportunism are concerned, I am quite certain that the Deputy Prime Minister means that it ought to work both ways. It cannot be a case of pointing fingers at the Opposition and accusing them of that when certain actions of ruling party politicians on the ground are no better.But having said that, I accept the Deputy Prime Minister's concerns of our democracy and, certainly, the WP, and I hope the Opposition in general, will be mindful going forward and work towards the betterment of Singapore and Singaporeans. Mr Speaker: Mr Leong Mun Wai.\",\n",
       " 'Thank you, Mr Speaker. Just for the record, I need to state this for the record because the WP never made a request for information on people born in Singapore. So, I just want to be very careful about that, because that gets us into very dangerous territory. ',\n",
       " \"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank you to the Minister for his speech and for referring to the point I made about an English requirement.Sir, I have two clarifications. The first is this. I did not say that an English requirement would be a single point of consideration for PRs and new citizenship applications. I think the Minister, in his characterisation, framed it as a sort of litmus test. In fact, I made it clear in my speech today that it was a nudge to align our immigration policy and our bilingual policy.And for individuals like foreign spouses who would have some difficulty, especially if English is not a common language that they use; or with respect to Minister's family member who is very old now, for which a test may have been problematic a long time ago – the test is not in that context a veto factor. The existing criteria would apply and it would be a consideration when an immigration decision is considered – that actually this person already has a common lingua franca that many Singaporeans actually share. So, I think the point was a little more nuanced than what the Minister enunciated.I think the second point is international students who are today foreigners; if they want to enter our primary school system, they already have to take a Cambridge English qualification test. So, it is not as if this is really a left-field suggestion or something which is too off the mark.And to that end, I refer to the survey in my speech. I think the Minister would have seen it. The Minister referred to various criteria that we broadly know with respect to immigration. But that survey found the ability to communicate in English ranks number one. In fact, the number one position was shared with economic contributions to Singapore.And in that context, I think it is a good time to include what MP Murali Pillai spoke about the psyche of the nation and how people's views change through generations and how important this is becoming as a consideration for some Singaporeans.But I do not want to lean too much into one survey alone. I am sure the Ministry may have a more global perspective of opinion. I am just suggesting that this is something which I felt was important for the Government to consider.\",\n",
       " 'First and foremost, given the low number of intra-corporate transferees and, as the Leader of the Opposition has persistently said that these are matters of national interest, it appears that in every single debate that we have, every single issue has now been put up as national interest. I am glad he acknowledges and he shares my point about having this common social compact. But I hope that in terms of perhaps prioritising some of these questions and having a more precise and surgical differentiated way of asking these questions could be one way of making it a lot easier.Mr Speaker: Minister Ong Ye Kung.',\n",
       " 'Mr Speaker, and to all Members of this House, I have consistently been providing the data. Perhaps the Member may not understand my overarching English, maybe the proficiency of my English. Today, in Singapore, we are at full employment. Our long-term unemployment rate is at 0.6% to 0.7%. In fact, in my reports, as I have shared, for the year ending 2022, the number of resident employment, that means, locals – Singapore Citizens, PRs – resident employment has gone to even before pre-COVID-19 days, before 2019. In all of my interventions, in all of my speeches, I have consistently shared that for the foreign talent that have come in, it has resulted in an increase in the number of jobs created and employment opportunities for Singaporeans. This is precisely my point earlier on to Mr Pritam Singh. When you want to go and dive into the data between whether that Singapore Citizen is born here or born elsewhere and then become naturalised, or how many generations, I think those kinds — no, no, I am not conflating it, Leader of the Opposition. I am not conflating. I am just saying, using it as an example to say that this is the type of data we do not release. So, I hope you do not conflate the entire discussions together. I rest my case. Mr Speaker: Mr Singh.',\n",
       " 'Thank you, thank you.Mr Speaker: Mr Leong Mun Wai.',\n",
       " 'Point of order, Speaker. Mr Speaker: Minister Tan.',\n",
       " \"I was providing a point of clarification to Mr Pritam Singh's speech. So, I hope that we can keep it as that. Mr Speaker: Mr Leong Mun Wai.\",\n",
       " 'Perhaps if he would like a separate debate, he can file another Parliamentary Question on the issue of the jobs statistics.',\n",
       " 'I was not intending to speak but the Leader of the Opposition mentioned my name a few times. What the Leader of the Opposition said in his speech, I think it was a similar point that he made in the July 2021 debate, which was that if only MOM released the number early, you could have quelled all the xenophobia. I took that point. And my answer in July 2021, I think it is the same answer today. We take to heart the feedback that the Member gave. If we have released, perhaps, it would have quelled all the xenophobia and all the raw emotions. But as Minister Tan See Leng said, that data was graded confidential or maybe even secret, I am not sure. But it was not ready for release, because when you release intra-corporate transferees of a particular country, others may compare, it can have other ramifications. So, it is not something that Ministry officials will readily say, \"Let us release it for Parliament\". But the situation became like that. CECA became a big issue with a lot of raw emotions, got debated here. In the end, these Ministers had a serious discussion and said \"Let us release it\". And so, we take your point but it is not that straightforward a matter but nevertheless.I think what Minister Tan See Leng is also trying to say is that after all this, let us not blame this whole debate and raw emotions around CECA on MOM because they never released intra-corporate transferee data. It is not because of that. No. If we are honest with ourselves, it is not because of that. It could have quelled it. But I think many other factors took place resulting in those raw emotions, which is most unfortunate.Mr Speaker: Mr Pritam Singh.',\n",
       " \"Sir, on the larger point that the Leader of the Opposition Mr Singh had highlighted, I am glad that he agrees with me that we do need both serious Government and serious Opposition in our maturing democracy. I made the point in my speech. He has a different view on the way I have characterised some of the proposals made by the Opposition. That is his view and I accept that. I think there we may well have to agree to disagree.But I made this broader point about how our democracy will evolve because I do worry when I look at how democracies elsewhere have evolved. Look at the great democracies of the world. Democracies far bigger, far more developed than us and look at where they are now – how their societies have become divided and polarised, how their systems have become stuck in gridlock. It is not as though their people are unloyal to their countries – not at all.But how is it that these countries have become so dysfunctional where politics is concerned? And what makes us so sure that Singapore is immune and we somehow can avoid such a fate happening in Singapore down the road? So, I think there are lessons for us. And the lessons are, if you look at many of these countries, populism has taken root and populism has damaged greatly their societies; divided and polarised their people.What is populism? Populism is politics that suppresses the truth, shades the truth, gets into post-truth, distorts the facts for political advantage. Populism is politics that pretends there are simple answers to complex issues, because there are not. And if such populism were ever to take root in Singapore, well, in the short term, parties that push out such populist policies may gain some advantage, but in the longer term it will cause great damage to Singapore and Singaporeans.So, from the Government's point of view, our stand is very clear. We reject all forms of populism. We make sure and we uphold honesty and integrity in policymaking. If the Government were ever to fall short of these standards, we expect the Opposition to call us out and say so. Please do. You have to do it. We expect you to do it.Conversely, if the Opposition were to propose ideas and policies that we feel are populist, we, likewise, will highlight them and highlight our concerns. Rightfully so. So, I hope that is our common understanding of how we can take Singapore's politics and democracy forward. Mr Pritam Singh said that Singaporeans believe in the cause of the Opposition and does not want the cause of the Opposition to falter and fade away. I believe there is a role for the Opposition to play in our politics, in our democracy and it is a very important role to campaign for your ideas and your proposals to hold the elected Government to account and to offer serious alternatives to the Government. Mr Singh says it takes time and you are not ready to form the next Government. You take one step at a time, one-third. But in politics, things can happen very quickly.So, I am glad Mr Singh is mindful that there is an important role for the Opposition to play and I think he should start thinking about how he and the WP can, indeed, perhaps, not sitting on that side of the aisle, but on this side of the aisle in future, down the road. What sort of agenda you would offer Singaporeans and what you would do if you were to form the Government?If there is one thing that I hope all of us can take away from this debate and, given that there is, in fact, I would say, some common understanding of this, from what I hear from Mr Singh's speech, one outcome that we might be able to say to Singaporeans, it is this: that together in this House, both sides of the House, we stand for a democracy that is maturing, a serious Government and a serious Opposition. We say yes to all that, but we say no to populism and political opportunism ever taking root in this House and in Singapore. [Applause.]Mr Speaker: Mr Singh. \",\n",
       " \"Speaker, I would like to thank, first of all, the 4G leaders led by the Deputy Prime Minister, to have initiated this very frank discussion as to how our democracy is maturing and also what should be the way, how should be the way we work in Parliament. Unfortunately, I had been observing the proceedings at home for the last few days because of my family's medical problems; and I also thank Speaker for being so indulgent in allowing me to have my absence. First of all, I would like to say that the PSP is also very in agreement and supportive that in a maturing democracy, we need both a responsive Government and also an Opposition that can put up alternative policies. However, I think what we have discussed so far in the debate is that there are two areas that we hope the Government would realise. One is, from the point of view of the PSP in the course of all my debates with the Government, is, one, data is really not enough. Two, which is quite obvious over the last few years from my experience in this Parliament, is the attitude of the Government towards the Opposition. And that point stands out very strongly, especially recently when the Deputy Prime Minister made the point that Opposition parties have not put up serious alternative agenda or policies. So, I would like to —Mr Speaker: Mr Leong, just to clarify, you are asking some clarifications?\",\n",
       " 'Yes, yes. So, on the issue of data, can I ask the Manpower Minister, Dr Tan See Leng, that I was the one who initiated the job debate in 2021, and the purpose of initiating that debate is to really determine whether Singaporeans overall have been affected by the foreign talent policy or not. But until today, would the Minister agree that we do not have enough data to conclude with certainty that Singaporeans have not been displaced from the job market?In 2021, we raised this point that the Minister has claimed — I raise this point again that the Minister had raised the data that in the 15 years from 2005 to 2020, 380,000 PME jobs had been created for locals, which also include the Permanent Residents (PRs). But then we took the data and we looked at it, and then we asked, but this includes all the PRs in the definition of locals, right? So, during the same 15-year period, we have 650,000 new —Mr Speaker: Mr Leong, if I may ask, what is the clarification you are specifically asking for?',\n",
       " 'Yes, so, the Minister he has not provided enough data to prove conclusively that Singaporeans have not been displaced from the market. Can I ask that first question first?Mr Speaker: Minister Tan See Leng.',\n",
       " 'Speaker, however, PSP disagrees. PSP thinks that —Mr Speaker: Mr Leong, this is not meant to be a debate on that particular issue. Your clarifications, please. You have other clarifications?',\n",
       " 'In that case, can we sort of agree to disagree here, that the Minister thinks that it is because the data is so sensitive, we cannot get into the bottom —',\n",
       " 'Speaker, I do not understand what is the meaning of that.Mr Speaker: Minister Tan See Leng, Mr Leong does not understand you.',\n",
       " 'Meaning I cannot ask a question? ',\n",
       " 'But, Speaker, just now I raised a clarification, right? So, the Minister had answered me. So, now, I ask for another clarification, that is okay, right?Mr Speaker: Yes. Please do. ',\n",
       " 'In that case, can I clarify that we agree to disagree? You said that we cannot get into the breakdown of those numbers because you do not want to differentiate Singaporeans, naturalised Singaporeans, locals, PRs, all that. And, as a result, we cannot get to the bottom of whether Singaporeans have been displaced or not. Mr Speaker: Mr Leong, if I may, I think Minister Tan responded by explaining as to the employment situation in Singapore, as to how employment is being created. So, I think that was his response to your query about the displacement and so on. So, if you have further clarifications, please proceed. ',\n",
       " 'Yes, Speaker, but I would like to make the point also that the unemployment data and overall employment figures sometimes can hide some of the other relevant information about what are the changes in the job market. Mr Speaker: And your clarification would be?',\n",
       " 'So, never mind, I will rest the case. Thanks. Mr Speaker: Ms Mariam Jaafar. ',\n",
       " 'Mr Speaker, I stand in the support of the Motion. I declare that I am the Managing Director and Partner of a management consulting firm that does work in the areas of digital, artificial intelligence and skills development.At the start of this Parliament term, I delivered my maiden speech titled \"The Nation that Learns the Fastest\". I spoke then about what I felt was needed for Singapore to thrive in a rapidly changing world: the importance of lifelong learning, the need for companies to take responsibility for their employees\\' learning, the need for companies to give more Singaporeans a chance and to look beyond paper qualifications, the need for stronger anti-discrimination protection, the need for each of us as leaders to go beyond telling people to be better, faster, work harder to providing emotional support, networks and social capital, and the need for companies to be better corporate citizens and proactively address critical social issues in order to earn the social licence to operate.So, it is with the greatest humility that I express my appreciation to the Government for the significant moves that have been made in the past two and a half years on each of these and the significant moves that will be made in the next two and a half years, some of which have been announced in the past weeks and days, and some that are yet to come but foreshadowed in the Forward SG conversations. I do not claim to be the first to bring forth any of these ideas. There is no such thing as a monopoly of ideas, but if my analysis and the voices of my residents and other Singaporeans that I have surfaced have had even a small impact on their thinking, I think the past two and a half years would have been well spent.On the announcements, there are a few areas where I would offer a slightly more nuanced view. Take, for example, the idea of supporting workers to take time off to train. The reality is, many companies, especially SMEs, find it challenging to give \"time off\" to train, and this is exacerbated by the experience that some SME owners have shared with me – that their employees do not seem to bring something useful back to the business after going for training, so, it is almost like sending them on a holiday. This is not good for employees either – the forgetting curve I referred to in my maiden speech tells us that they will quickly forget what they have learnt.Sir, it is really as Minister Chan Chun Sing has said before – business transformation and workforce transformation must go hand in hand. Decoupling training time and working time is less optimal than designing training to be integrated with their jobs while those jobs and the companies they belong to are being transformed. We have to push both, not separately, but together. An even more joined-up approach among the economic, workforce development and skills development agencies, would be incredibly useful.But, generally, the policy questions being considered and positions being taken address a lot of the preoccupations on my mind two and a half years ago. So, this could be a rather short speech, if the environment around us had not changed. But in that same two and a half years, some things have changed, or accelerated, significantly and suddenly. Prime Minister Lee and other Members have talked about the different storms and opportunities that preoccupy us today. I wish to speak today on one of these things that has become a preoccupation on my mind and that of many business leaders, that is, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence or AI, precipitated by the explosion of interest in generative AI.Generative AI has been developing quietly for some time, gaining attention in recent years with the launch of technologies, like DALL.E, Image Generation, Mind Journey, Stable Diffusion. But it got a massive shot in the arm with the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, which became the fastest growing app in history, reaching 1.6 billion visits in March. Suddenly, in the words of Andrei Karpathy, one of the founders of OpenAi, \"English is the hottest new programming language\" and anyone could access ChatGPT to generate the most likely output to any query and take advantage of its key distinguishing feature – the ability to generate new realistic content – text, image or video.In effect, generative AI has democratised AI – and when democratisation happens, revolution is usually swift to follow. Much as the launch of the first Web Browser MOSAIC in 1993 democratised the Internet and triggered the Internet revolution, ChatGPT and other generative AI technologies are triggering the AI revolution and will transform all industries and societies.The possibilities opened up by generative AI are well documented. The hon Member Dr Tan Wu Meng, and others have referenced some of these in their speeches this week. Generative AI enables greater productivity and the turbocharging of innovation to solve unsolved problems – in business, but also in education, in healthcare and in other areas that are going to help a lot of people. Insilico Medicine uses Generative AI to identify a novel drug candidate for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in just 21 days, compared to years in traditional drug discovery.But there are also a lot of risks and worries about generative AI and rightly so. Anyone who has used Chat GPT will know that the model can generate nonsense output. There are also real issues of output that is not factual or bias, due to bias in real world data. Businesses engaging in AI are grappling with the risk of data leaks, copyright infringement and uncontrollable shadow AI in their organisations. Companies and societies worry about socioeconomic displacement, the potential of job losses at an unprecedented scale, including of \"knowledge workers\" – marketers, lawyers, accountants, architects, developers, engineers, analysts, and, yes, even management consultants.No less worrying is the risk of ever more sophisticated phishing, deepfakes and fraud at the hands of bad people – cybercrime has never been easier! – the potential impact on security and defense, and the very institution of democracy itself. Then, there is the fact that a few companies control a large share of the technology, tech that is now moving from open source to proprietary ownership by companies with a for profit motive, leading to an AI arms race among companies and countries, for bigger and better algorithms, data, computing power and talent.And what about the environment? If you thought Bitcoin\\'s energy consumption was bad, well, an Open AI study showed that the energy cost of training an AI algorithm is increasing at an exponential rate, which if it is continues, by 2027, in just four years, the largest model\\'s cost will surpass the GDP of the US. Then, we have the speculative doomsday scenarios, where machines attain human level intelligence or artificial general intelligence (AGI), and take over the world, destroying humanity in the process. Speculative or not, so great is the worry, that the Future Life Institute put out a call for a six-month pause, or moratorium, on training AI models more powerful than Open AI\\'s GPT-4 model, and some very smart people have signed this proposal. In reality, we are further away from AGI than the recent hype may suggest. As Yann Le Cun of META put it, we humans are very language oriented. \"We think when something is fluent, it\\'s also intelligent, but it\\'s not true\". And I think that resonates with many of us.   I will not go into the merits of the moratorium proposal – others much deeper in this field than me have opined on this, but as a believer in progress through knowledge, the idea seems unfruitful and impractical.   For me, the real question is not, whether machines can attain human intelligence, or even when that might happen, but rather: how do we, as a country, best prepare for the eventual future and have a voice in influencing how it all develops to protect and advance our interests. The time has come for governments to recognise that we are at a precipice and that they must act to determine the position they want to hold with respect to AI, the impact on their people and the required adaptations and the policies they must make going forward to ensure the effective and ethical development and deployment of AI and Generative AI.  Singapore launched our National AI Strategy in 2019, which reflects our commitment to being a leader in developing and deploying scalable, impactful AI solutions, in key sectors of high value and relevance to our citizens and businesses along with five National AI Projects and five ecosystem enablers.AI Singapore has partnered with businesses to nurture the development and adoption of AI models in key sectors like healthcare, transportation and finance. It also runs the AI Apprenticeship programme. In this year\\'s Committee of Supply (COS), Minister Josephine Teo, shared that AI Singapore will double the number of AI Apprentices trained over the next five years from 200 to 400. All this is good progress. But if we are standing at the precipice of an AI revolution, do we need to revisit the ambition, scope and pace of our national AI strategy and our AI policies, to avoid being left behind in the arms race, and to create more value for the world and for ourselves? Today, I want to focus on two potential areas to double down on: one, building an AI and generative AI-ready people; and two, leading the way in promoting better and safer AI and generative AI development and deployment. First, building an AI and generative AI-ready people. This AI revolution will have a massive impact on people and jobs. Four things we need to do.First, anticipate. Anticipate how jobs will change in a generative AI world. Instead of creating content or code or preparing or processing documents, people will be supervising first drafts by AI while focusing more on strategic thinking, building customer relationships and developing more complex campaigns using AI tools. Some jobs will be eliminated. This is not new – we are used by now to technology disruption. But what is going to be different is the scale and speed at which this will happen. So, reskilling and reemployment, at scale, at speed, alongside managing the impact on people\\'s professional identity and self-esteem, is going to be a serious challenge. And we will need to face up to the possibility, the probability that some will be left behind and this will require a new tilt towards redistribution.During this year\\'s Budget debate, I raised that the time may have come to consider retrenchment support and Deputy Prime Minister Wong suggested in his speech that targeted re-employment support is being considered. It is timely today, but think about what might be needed 10 years from now. We need to anticipate this and time the shifts appropriately.   In making these shifts, I hope we will remember that AI itself could be part of the solution, removing some traditional trade-offs. For example, AI can help in personalised reskilling at scale. We could also look at using AI in social services to provide tailored social and reemployment support at scale – rather than compromising someone that tolerated for the sake of ease of implementation. While all this will require public trust in AI and public officer\\'s proper adoption of AI.  Second, develop. Develop talent for the range of AI roles required – data scientists, but also designers, engineers, ethicists and so on. Remember it is possible that AI will create as many jobs as it displaces. AI talent will be needed in business, academia and public service. And sorry, but we are not talking 400 people here. So, we will need training programmes at scale, at speed, to build a workforce that will be AI competitive 10 years from now.Third, attract. Attract the global talent with the new skillsets for the new jobs that AI will create. I think we do not have to explain that. And finally, engage. Engage Singaporeans to not fear this AI revolution, but to embrace it and this is a massive change management effort. I once received an email from a resident. He observed the challenges and stress that people have adapting to technology, and asked, why does Singapore have to move so fast to adopt the latest technology? Why are we so obsessed with becoming a Smart Nation? Why can we not make the choice to stick to low technology or non technology approaches on some things to make life easier for our people? We need to make people understand it is not a matter of choice. The AI revolution will not wait for us. But we need to assure people that humans are not going anywhere – humans are needed to deploy AI effectively and ethically. We need to inspire people – it is not all about avoiding displacement – there are all these very exciting opportunities that a general purpose technology like generative AI allows the young and not so young, to find application in all facets of the economy, of life, that can create value for a lot of people and help a lot of people and that should be empowering.  And we need to monitor the pulse of our people and make interventions along the way.  Second, leading the way in promoting better and safer AI development and deployment. As Minister Ong said, responsible stewardship is a hallmark of our policy-making. AI governance and ethics is already a key pillar of the National AI strategy. Earlier in the day, Senior Minister of State Janil had talked about AI Verify and some of the tools that we have already developed by Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC).  But the many ethical and legal concerns that people have about AI point to the fact that research in AI governance and ethics has lagged other aspects like compute power. There are big questions yet unsolved on issues like liability in the event of harm or bias, like data protection, privacy protection. How to prevent ChatGPT from becoming a tool for spreading misinformation and bias? As we move towards to AGI, how to ensure that AI systems behave in ways that are aligned to human values will be critical to advancing the progress of AI. So, regulation of AI is gathering momentum globally. More than 60 plus countries and territories are considering some 800 measures. Prominent among these is the EU AI Act, the first broad regulatory framework on AI, unveiled in 2021. The Act sets out different rules and bans certain practices and imposes stiff penalties, up to 6% of a company\\'s global revenues, for those in breach and the scope is global. But the rapid advances in generative AI show how difficult it is for regulations to keep up, with EU lawmakers struggling to reach consensus as to how to deal with them in the Act.   In Singapore, the Model Governance Framework lays out principles, but not penalties. It seeks to build public trust and understanding and to balance innovation and protection. There is no AI specific regulation, but deployment of AI requires consideration of other existing regulations.I think this approach is pragmatic, but some have wondered if it is too top down and does not do enough to ensure that responsibility cascades down the organisation. And others have asked if more regulatory power is needed given our status as a global financial and technological hub.  So, how could Singapore be of value to the world in this regard? One, invest in AI governance and ethics research; two, ensure ethical guiderails and legal protections keep up with the rapid advancements in generative AI; three, support businesses in setting up responsible AI programmes; and four, serve as a global reference point to contribute to the development of global standards. Global standards are needed but difficult in a world where the global governance order is collapsing and on an issue that is so ideologically charged. But therein lies the opportunity for Singapore.As a colleague commented: \"Singapore\\'s middle ground between the East and West is uniquely interesting. The US or Western logic of absolute freedom of expression is hitting the limit of fake news at scale with generative AI. The Chinese over control is hitting the limit of tech progress\". He continued \"I find policy making in Singapore much more nuanced when approaching those questions. Less dogmatic. So for me, it brings legitimacy.\" His comments raise an interesting question as to the role Singapore could play in leading a global effort. Whether we strengthen ethical guidelines or put more teeth with regulations and legal protections is something to be evaluated against the trade-offs between innovation and protection.But there can be more regrets in increasing understanding. How can we increase understanding and align others to work together to manage our common concerns? Forums with technology providers, civil society and governments help. Could the approach taken in dealing with online falsehoods and Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Regulations (POFMA) be something to consider – rigorous public hearings and a national debate to study the risks and issues and recommend strategies to deal with them? And hopefully, this time, we can all agree that it is for the common good and avoid its politicisation.   Mr Speaker, the progress in AI is exciting and worrying at the same time. I agree with Dr Tan Wu Meng, that in a world of AI disruption, togetherness and trust is more important than ever before. But that alone is not enough. We need our AI strategies, policies and people to keep pace with the breathless development; so let us buckle up! [Applause.] Mr Speaker: Mr Sitoh Yih Pin.',\n",
       " 'Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Motion. At the address for the Opening of the second session of the 14th Parliament last week, Mdm President spoke on the geopolitical and economic challenges we face on the horizon and the need to refresh our social compact. She also set out the Government\\'s agenda for the next half term of the 14th Parliament. In doing so, she reaffirmed the core values of Singaporeans: fairness, inclusivity, mutual support, equality and a sense of belonging for all regardless of background so that every Singaporean is afforded the opportunity to achieve his or her full potential.  These core values may appear intuitive to most Singaporeans in the context of the present day. It is almost like an unwritten code that forms part of the psyche of being a Singaporean.And yet, we sometimes forget that these core values underpinning our social compact is not an inherent trait nor did it happen by chance. It is the result of hard work, deliberate effort and, dare I say, a lot of gumption and guts by our founding leaders in their efforts to build and forge social cohesion and unity among a diverse group of disparate migrant communities who have come to Singapore in search of a better future.Sir, in preparing to speak today, I chanced upon a speech that then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew gave on 11 December 1965 at Serangoon Gardens Circus.It was just after Independence – four months, in fact. Then-Prime Minister Lee was brutally frank and honest about the immense challenges that Singapore was facing post-Independence, but he also made it crystal clear the direction and values upon which Singapore was to be built upon moving forward.  A part of his speech I thought summarised our social compact very well. He said, \"Anyway, the end result was that we were kicked out of Malaysia after two years. And I say that we make it succeed – from here. First, this belongs to all Singaporeans, regardless of race, language, religion. Second, when there is progress, we ensure that the progress is spread equally, regardless of race, language or religion. There will be the same schools for all, the same hospitals for all, the same low-cost housing for all – regardless of whether you are brown, black, yellow, green or any other spectrum of the rainbow. Provided you are loyal, you belong, you intend to make this place tick. I say you are a partner with me in this enterprise. And slowly, over the years, something is going to happen.\"Sir, that something did happen.In 1976, I started studying at Serangoon Gardens Secondary School as a 13-year-old, a stone\\'s throw from the same Serangoon Gardens Circus the speech was made a mere 11 years earlier. I was the middle child of three boys to a pair of Chinese language teachers living in the promised low-cost housing, attending the same school with my Malay, Indian and other Chinese schoolmates from varying socioeconomic backgrounds. Looking back, Sir, it is an absolute privilege to have lived through the earlier years where we worked towards this social compact together as a nation.  Sir, to put things in perspective, embarking on this multiracial and multicultural path with an inclusive social compact was a unique one at the time. As Mr Lee Kuan Yew also shared in his speech, the other path, which was arguably an easier and more popular route by other countries of the time, was communalism, where one appeals to one\\'s race, one\\'s language, one\\'s religion, oftentimes that of the majority.But we were determined, together with our successive leaders, to hold on and continue to build upon the core values of a multiracial, multicultural society that leverages diversity as a strength towards creating a shared sense of belonging and identity. In so doing, we have also allowed different communities to be free to preserve and promote their cultural heritage and to practice customs and beliefs while always being mindful of the rights and sensibilities of others.  Sir, we were never a homogenous people speaking a common tongue or practicing a common religion and I believe we never had any aspirations to be one. We were diverse but united in our belief that we are here to build a nation that every single one of us, regardless of race, language or religion, had a stake in.  Being unique took many years of hard work and consistency in nation-building and I will be the first to say that while we have come a long way, we are far from the finished article. In fact, this is likely to be a continuing work in progress for as long as we believe that this is the social compact we want for Singapore.There are some who point to instances which suggest the polarisation of Singapore\\'s society along socioeconomic status, race and nationality. There have also been vocal discussions on many social issues involving these topics. These topics that relate closely to our social compact.  I had also raised these issues at the Committee of Supply Debates for MCCY in the last two years. Sir, I think, however, that such discourse can be useful if discussed in a constructive and respectful manner. It can also prompt a deeper reflection about our values and what it means to be Singaporean.  From another perspective, if we were instead a nation of one race, one language and one religion, then such discussions would surely end in a tragic outcome, as shown elsewhere around the world.    Being able to constructively discuss such sensitive matters freely speaks volumes on how far we have come since Independence. We exhibit concern over these matters because they are vitally important to us. We take collective action because it goes to the very core values of the social compact that we have so painstakingly built over the years.  It is therefore with much anticipation that I look forward to our Government\\'s efforts and agenda in refreshing our social compact.Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to add that I listened to the speeches by the hon Members of the WP, Mr Leon Perera and Mr Faisal Manap. They made some comments about the People\\'s Association (PA) that I disagree with completely. Mr Leon Perera and Mr Faisal Manap are quite wrong. The People\\'s Association (PA) and its members are here to serve fellow Singaporeans and not to advance the interest of any political party. In fact, there are very strict rules on PA\\'s activities, its roles and its objectives.Mr Leon Perera and Mr Faisal Manap\\'s statements do not do justice to the contributions of many thousands of grassroots leaders, staff and volunteers in our PA community. These people come forward to serve the community and fellow residents and build a better Singapore.Mr Faisal Manap had also made comments about wanting to have the resources of a PA network and to be able to do things like give out Edusave awards.He only asked to be involved in some small selected part of the work of the grassroots advisor. He is not going to do the equally important work of explaining difficult Government policies. He is not going to go out into the community and explain the need for GST to be increased or for public transport fares to be adjusted or for any number of popular but vital and important policies where as community leaders, we have to convince residents that the long-term interests of Singapore are best served by taking these steps.He has asked to only do the nice things – hand out awards, take photographs, congratulate families. Yes, these are nice things. Events to celebrate. As a grassroots advisor, I am glad to be able to be with the families and share their joy and pride. But these are the results of Government programmes and Government policies.If Mr Faisal Manap is going to be honest about this issue, he needs to admit that he cannot fulfil the role of grassroots advisor on behalf of the Government when he disagrees with so many of the Government\\'s policies and with how the Government raises money to fund its progress.Mr Speaker, Sir, PA does important work for the good of Singapore and Singaporeans. It also handles the difficult work of engaging the public on the hard truths involved in making our society harmonious, peaceful and sustainable. I thank the hardworking staff and volunteers for all that they do for all of us. [Applause.]Mr Speaker: Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat.',\n",
       " 'Mr Speaker, Sir, over the past few days, we have heard diverse views on how we can take Singapore forward in a more uncertain and contested world.The Prime Minister spoke about the grave geopolitical and economic outlook and how we must stay united, be go-getting and uphold our good standing in the world. Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence laid out five key shifts to create a stronger social compact to take Singapore forward. Members have offered perspectives and suggestions across a range of issues and concerns.I will not attempt to sum up, which will not do justice to the range and quality of ideas that have been raised in this House but allow me to commend Members on two counts – first, for identifying difficult issues early, putting forward ideas and solutions to address them and highlighting the trade-offs. Second, that even in proposing changes, many Members abide by certain fundamentals precious to Singapore, such as fairness, multiracialism and our approach of tripartism. This is what Forward Singapore is about – building on strong foundations and at the same time, having the courage to do things differently from before if needed. It is befitting that this Debate is taking place in the year that we commemorate the 100th birth anniversary of Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Some thirty years ago, I was at a meeting where Mr Lee asked a successful American venture capitalist why he had asked Mr Lee to meet with him. The American replied that Mr Lee was the \"ultimate entrepreneur\". While he, the venture capitalist, helped build successful companies, Mr Lee built a new nation – two remarkable lifelong learners learning from each other.Indeed, the newly independent Singapore was akin to a startup – figuring out our economic strategy, attracting companies to invest, building up our workers\\' capabilities while ensuring national cohesion and security. Mr Lee did not do it alone. He had a team of capable comrades like Dr Goh Keng Swee, Mr Rajaratnam, Encik Othman Wok and many more. Together, they laid a strong foundation for Singapore to take off. The best way for us to remember Mr Lee and our founding fathers is to learn from and build on this. Indeed, this is what Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence and the 4G team are doing – to refresh our social compact and bring Singapore forward. Like Mr Lee and the founding fathers, the 4G team must win the trust of Singaporeans by setting out a clear plan to secure a better future for all. Our plans must address Singaporeans\\' aspirations and concerns, given today\\'s context of an ageing population, greater economic disruption, a worrisome international environment and differences in starting points. This is why the Forward Singapore agenda sets out the shifts we need to make to refresh our social compact. This unity and clear sense of purpose is crucial if we are to continue to secure our place in the world. As President said in her address, we must \"take the world as it is, and not what we wish it to be\". Over the years, our policies and hard work have earned Singapore and Singaporeans a good reputation. The next lap will see new challenges as geopolitics become more unsettling, technology and innovation disrupt jobs more rapidly and our constraints of land, labour and carbon become tighter, but I am optimistic that we can once again turn challenges into opportunities and secure a bright future for Singapore and Singaporeans. Within our short history, we have managed to survive and thrive through even more difficult circumstances. A key lesson is that to continue to succeed, we must stay relevant and useful to the world while deepening our social cohesion and national unity. As we look forward towards the future, allow me to touch on three things we need to get right, in addition to the many that many of you have suggested. First, we must grow a vibrant and innovative economy. Second, we must develop every Singaporean to their fullest potential and empower each one to thrive and succeed.Third, we must remain open as an economy, as a society and as a people. Let me start with growing the economy.Some may ask whether we should move beyond economic growth to focus on other pressing domestic issues such as caring for our seniors and uplifting those with disadvantages. After all, we are almost at full employment and the constant call to upgrade and reskill can be tiresome. This is a false choice.Throughout our history, growth has never been for growth\\'s sake. Growth is critical for giving us the means to build a better Singapore and better lives for Singaporeans. Growth allows our people to access good jobs, fulfil their aspirations and raise their families. It generates the resources for our nation to fund needs and priorities, such as supporting families, caring for our seniors and uplifting those with disadvantages. Thinking longer term, growth coupled with prudence has enabled us to build a buffer to weather many storms.Our national reserves were created through the surpluses generated by strong economic growth. Our founding fathers and successive governments were disciplined about saving for a rainy day.Within my career, I have experienced many of such rainy days – the Asian Financial Crisis, the dot.com bubble, the Global Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, which plunged us into one of the worst recessions. We supported our workers and companies through these crises and retained their capabilities. This enabled Singapore to bounce back quickly.  During the COVID-19 crisis, we rolled out five Budgets in one year and eventually drew down around $40 billion from past reserves to save lives and livelihoods. Most remarkably, we did not borrow a single cent, which would have burdened future generations. I am grateful, as a citizen, that we could do this. Without strong growth and the discipline of setting aside resources to provide a buffer against the unexpected, Singapore and Singaporeans would have been worse off.So, let us resolve to not just think about the next election, but to think long-term, about the future of Singapore and Singaporeans. We must do our best to build up the capability and resources for future generations of Singaporeans, just as the previous generations had done for us.This is why we should think carefully when the WP says that they reject the GST hike because one alternative that they have been constantly offering is to increase the proportion used from returns on investments. This will slow down the rate of accumulating reserves, leaving future generations with less resources.Sustaining growth and creating good jobs for our people will become harder in the years ahead. Besides getting our fiscal and monetary policies right, we must address structural changes that are sweeping across the world. Let me mention just three. First, scientific and technological innovation will reshape every sector of the economy even more rapidly than before. Industry 4.0 is reshaping jobs and skills. Today, robots can enable factories to operate round-the-clock. In fact, I myself have seen several dark factories, where it is not even lighted up, because the robots were all doing the job and they did not need lights. And an AI can spot disease on x-rays as accurately as a human radiologist. Ms Mariam Jaafar spoke about the impact of AI earlier.New sectors like the digital economy and renewables, biotech and a whole range of others are advancing rapidly. There is now a more dynamic corporate landscape of startups and smaller companies, pushing the frontiers with greater agility. Many traditional firms and workers will find this competition unsettling. Competition not just from other countries or from foreigners, but from greater automation and AI. Yet these advances also offer the best hope for addressing global challenges like climate change and ageing populations, from extending healthy longevity, to new low-carbon technology that can bring us closer towards a net-zero world. We must learn to harness the best of science, technology and innovation, while supporting our workers and companies to ride these advances and blunting the sharp edges that they bring. Second, as countries realise the critical importance of technology, technological supply chains will increasingly bifurcate and fragment into competing blocs. The shift towards national security considerations and industrial policy will reverse the past three decades of globalisation and free trade. These will reduce efficiency and innovation. What does this mean for Singapore? Singapore\\'s small open economy, which has benefited from an open, multi-lateral framework, can be badly affected. We must stay nimble and adapt quickly. Third, ageing populations, especially in the developed world, will be a challenge for many governments. Ageing can significantly affect personal consumption, retirement adequacy, healthcare consumption and economic dynamism. In many countries, the social compact is being strained as societies confront this crisis. Singapore is facing similar challenges, and we will have to make difficult policy moves like raising taxes to support growing social needs. More fundamentally, we need to grapple with the difficult but critical issue of talent and immigration, which I will speak more about later. These three structural changes will transform the global economy. To succeed, we must press on with efforts to transform our economy, with the Government, businesses and workers working closely together. We had made a good start seven years ago. The Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) mobilise companies and workers in every sector to prepare for the future. We are now into our second iteration. ITM 2.0 includes two additional pillars – resilience and sustainability. Resilience to address shocks in the supply chains and sustainability to address carbon constraints.There is also a sharper focus on the future of jobs and skills, to better deploy technology, and prepare for an ageing workforce. I visited two companies which leveraged technology to redesign higher-value and better jobs for their older workers. One automated their entire processes. The founder explained to me that he trained a staff in his 60s to supervise the new automated system. I should tell Mr Leong Mun Wai that the founder was a foreigner who has been working here for many years and the older worker was a Singaporean whom he cared about and said, \"I\\'d better redesign the process\" to keep him employed. This staff was very qualified to do this because he had gone through the difficult manual work before and if there was any breakdown in the system, he would happen to be the best person to be able to do that. He was thoughtful enough and caring enough to redesign the whole job and train him to do it.Another company adopted the use of exoskeletons to enable their staff to lift objects safely. The broader point is that job redesign can be empowering and inclusive, a point that Miss Rachel Ong mentioned yesterday about helping persons with disabilities. Besides enabling older workers who wish to continue working to do so in a fulfilling and safe manner, it can enable differently-abled people to take on good jobs and fulfil their potential. With science and technology determining the next bound of growth and competitiveness, we must deepen Singapore\\'s investments in R&D, and tighten the linkage between our R&D and industry transformation efforts. In a more contested world, we should position Singapore as a Global Asia node of technology, innovation and enterprise. This way, we can attract, create and capture value in Singapore, which will benefit not just ourselves, but the region and the world. Over the years, we have invested in and grown our research, innovation and enterprise (RIE) capabilities. We have strengthened our research capabilities in our universities. The National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) are now ranked among the best in the world. Besides anchoring multi-national enterprises, we have also developed a lively startup ecosystem, connecting venture capital and private equity with innovative startups and companies. Our efforts have yielded good outcomes. Singapore is ranked among the top ten most innovative economies in the world.In an age of contestation, we must build bridges, not walls. Positioning Singapore as a Global Asia node is of strategic importance. We seek to be a trusted partner with strong regulatory frameworks and rules, and connected to different parts of the world. We can be the place that facilitates collaboration between like-minded partners and countries.We must continue to welcome the best researchers and scientists and entrepreneurs from around the world. As several Nobel laureates who were in Singapore for the Global Young Scientists Summit earlier this year told their audience, \"Science is Global. By building bridges, we can stay relevant and useful to the world\". So, I was glad to hear Mr Pritam Singh say earlier on that the WP is not xenophobic. I have spoken about growing our economy. Let me now move on to the next point. Ultimately, economic growth is about creating tangible benefits for all. To do this, we must develop every Singaporean fully and enable each to maximise his or her potential and seize opportunities.The World Bank ranks Singapore as the best place in the world for a child to realise his or her potential. It reflects our investments and shifts particularly in education, to support different pathways, skills and inclinations. And we plan to further widen the notion of meritocracy, as Minister Chan Chun Sing said earlier.Through our education system, we prepare our young people to navigate shifts and seize opportunities with confidence. One aspect is nurturing \"Asia-capable\" students who can operate and build connections in the region, which is a vast and growing market. Bilingualism and the experience of growing up in a multiracial society bring advantages.We nurture competencies like global awareness, cross-cultural literacy, communication and collaboration skills. And we provide opportunities for overseas exposure throughout the schooling journey, from internships to immersion programmes. These enable us to shape an outward orientation and acceptance of diversity from young. We also prepare our young people to harness and complement technology, by building skills that machines and AI cannot yet deliver well. For example, creativity, empathy and building connections are areas where human endeavour remains superior, at least for now. This is why we focus on building socio-emotional competencies, and enable our students to put scientific principles into practice through the Applied Learning Programme. Coupled with scholarships and study awards that span industries and sectors, our young people receive a continuum of support to build relevant competencies, pursue their passions and join the workforce with confidence. But developing our people must go beyond the schooling years. Success in a more disruptive world requires continuous reskilling throughout life. We must, as Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence said, strive to be a \"Learning Society – from cradle to grave\". We will strengthen our SkillsFuture movement to ensure Singaporeans are resilient and well-equipped to face the future. This goes hand-in-hand with jobs transformation and business transformations that we mentioned earlier. It also complements ongoing efforts at the industry level to develop Singaporeans, including ongoing efforts by the Singapore Business Federation. And there is scope to partner companies to develop Singaporeans for regional and global leadership roles.What does success look like when we put the efforts to develop our economy and our people together? Let me cite two concrete examples.  In our universities and research institutes, we have top academics and scientists working alongside Singaporeans who studied in the best universities in the world. This builds a strong ecosystem that attracts collaboration with the best researchers and universities. Our students benefit because they get to learn from top professors, interact with peers from all over the world, and strengthen their cross-cultural skills. Overseas, we are seeing enterprising Singaporeans and Singapore companies chasing opportunities and building new partnerships. When I visited Ho Chi Minh City last year, I met a startup formed by a young Singaporean and his Vietnamese friend. They had studied together in Singapore, and the both of them gamely ventured forth, the Singaporean staying in Singapore to run the business operations, and the Vietnamese in Vietnam, running the IT operations. These two examples illustrate the final point I would like to raise, that is, for Singapore to continue thriving, Government-led efforts to deepen collaboration, be it in free trade, investments, or research, is not enough. To reap the full benefit of these collaborations, Singapore and Singaporeans must remain not just open and connected, but relevant and useful. Remaining open in this era of contestation enables Singapore to capture new value and flows, and strengthen our capabilities. An open mindset and eagerness to venture beyond our shores enables Singaporeans to capture opportunities in the region and beyond. We must continually think about how Singapore and Singaporeans can be relevant and useful, and what special role we can play. Our value proposition is building connections across cultures and economies, and we must strengthen this.Openness is not new to Singapore. It is, in fact, core to our identity and values. Our plural, multiracial society reflects this open-mindedness. We chose to organise ourselves to ensure opportunities for all, regardless of race, language or religion. Just a few minutes earlier, we heard from Mr Sitoh Yih Pin a very moving account of his personal experience as a young student. It is an extraordinary principle, as the eminent historian Prof Wang Gungwu pointed out. Singapore, Prof Wang said, is the only nation that he knows of where the majority accepted that they had to treat everyone as equal and that a plural society was the foundation of her nationhood. This open-mindedness, coupled with our stable environment and strong governance, no doubt has resonance in today\\'s more fractured and fractious world.I am happy to see many of our people, especially our youths, venturing abroad. Our Global Innovation Alliance (GIA) – a network of 17 innovation hotspots around the world – has enabled our entrepreneurs to incubate their ideas and find partners overseas. Many local companies are also internationalising and finding success overseas. Our companies tap on their diverse workforce to navigate foreign markets. This spirit of adventure and entrepreneurship in our people is commendable. The value of being a Singaporean will rise if we remain dynamic, outward-looking and effective in building connections with people around the world. We must continue to encourage Singaporeans to venture out and to integrate the foreigners who are studying and working here, so that we can draw energy and capabilities from diverse sources.Let me repeat that. The value of being a Singaporean will rise, if we remain dynamic, outward-looking and effective in building connections with people around the world. We must continue to encourage Singaporeans to venture out and to integrate the foreigners who are studying and working here, so that we can draw energy and capabilities from diverse sources.At the same time, we must recognise that when the old encounters the new, this could spark off both opportunities and friction. While we pursue opportunities, we must also address frictions.Growing up in Singapore with fellow Singaporeans, we have developed a certain set of norms and behaviours. New citizens, Permanent Residents and work pass holders will likewise bring different sets of norms and behaviours. It may be uncomfortable experiencing these differences when we encounter newcomers. We may also be concerned about wealth inequality, more severe competition for jobs, or even unfair workplace practices. These are issues that the Government is addressing, by adjusting our policies, strengthening our frameworks and developing Singaporeans fully.Our commitment to openness remains unchanged, but we, too, can refine our approach to openness to ensure that it is fit for the times. Mr S Rajaratnam, in the early days of nationhood, said that \"being a Singaporean is not a matter of ancestry, it is a conviction and choice\".Conviction and values remain fundamental when we consider newcomers who seek to be a part of Singapore. If there are those who share in our convictions and values, let us encourage them to contribute and invite them to grow Singapore together. Many already are, and we will further nurture the philanthropy ecosystem. At the same time, having developed a set of norms and behaviours that is precious to us, we should set out these expectations and exhort newcomers seeking to sink roots in Singapore to adapt to these norms and behaviours. On the part of Singaporeans born and raised here, we must have the patience and empathy to help newcomers settle in and integrate better. This is how we can remain open yet cohesive as a society; open-minded yet proud of our Singapore identity; and successful as a nation and a people. Mr Speaker, Sir, let me say a few words in Mandarin.  (In Mandarin): [Please refer to Vernacular Speech.] Since our nation\\'s independence, openness and diversity have been critical to Singapore\\'s success. Today, Singapore\\'s ability to stand firm in a volatile world depends on how open-minded we are. To create a bigger stage for Singapore, first, we need to fully develop local talents. At the same time, we must continue to attract the best companies and the best talents.Foreign talents and the local labour workforce complement each other. When we attract high quality companies to set up shop here, we can create more jobs for Singaporeans. But foreigners could also compete with local workers. When local workers could not secure job offers or lose out on promotions, they might feel unfairly treated. On the other hand, when some foreign workers and their family members do not fully assimilate into our society, or do not adapt to our social norms, this could result in conflicts with Singaporeans.I understand that Singaporeans are worried and concerned about these issues. The Government has fine-tuned its policies. We have stipulated specific requirements to address the quality of foreign talents and to prevent concentration in certain sectors. The Government is also doing more to develop and train Singaporeans to enhance their competitiveness.At the same time, I would like to encourage foreign talents and new immigrants. As long as you are determined to make Singapore your home, put in effort to assimilate and contribute to our Singapore society and build a sense of belonging, you will be one of us.Only then, can the Singapore society remain cohesive and our people united, with everyone working together for the prosperity and progress of our nation. An open and diverse Singapore society allows us to connect with the rest of the world. This is unique to Singapore. Only when our society remains open and diverse, can Singapore continue to embody our values and shine internationally.(In English): Let me conclude in English. Mr Speaker, Sir, as we debated the Motion of thanks these past few days, I am struck by the President\\'s reminder to this House of our responsibility to steward Singapore for the next generations, just as previous generations have done for us. I started this speech with a story of a venture capitalist calling Mr Lee Kuan Yew the \"ultimate entrepreneur\", for building a nation out of a colonial outpost. Since our Independence, we have navigated major changes well and innovated in many areas.In the coming years, securing our future will require us to continue transforming our economy and creating new opportunities for our people. We must continue to have this spirit of pushing our frontiers, to harness technology and innovation to improve the lives of Singaporeans. We must take care of the most vulnerable segments of our society, while ensuring that our broad middle continue to see improvements in their lives. Most importantly, we must continue to build on the foundation of our national pledge – \"regardless of race, language or religion\" – to stay united in this contested world while deepening connections with people around the world. This way, Singapore and Singaporeans will stay relevant and useful to the world, and stay united and successful. Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion. [Applause.]Mr Speaker: Order. I propose to take a break now. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at . Sitting accordingly suspended at 2.55 pm until .Sitting resumed at .[Mr Speaker in the Chair] DEBATE ON PRESIDENT\\'S ADDRESSDebate resumed.Mr Speaker: Minister Edwin Tong.',\n",
       " 'Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have had several requests over the break to cut down on the speech. I am also mindful of colleagues who are celebrating Hari Raya and I want to wish them in advance Selamat Hari Raya. [Applause.]Sir, over the course of this week\\'s debate, we have talked about the many challenges that we see ahead of us, the shifts that we need to make in an increasingly difficult and changing environment – to face a harsher, more uncertain economic climate; to guard against growing inequality. Members have spoken about how we can strengthen our policies and our socio-economic infrastructure, in areas like education, employment and housing.  Sir, we have heard good many ideas and have had a lively, robust cut and thrust debate and I believe all these steps that we have heard in this House, they are all important, in and of themselves, as key success factors for Singapore. But equally critical and urgent is for us to be able to achieve all of this together, working in unity. All of us, a people of different backgrounds and persuasions, a diversity of cultures, faiths and languages coming together to build consensus, create space and forge a compact that can see us thrive and which can also help us withstand the growing external threats on the horizon. One shining example of how unity and cohesion has served us well was in how we tackled COVID-19 together, as a nation. Prime Minister spoke about this, on Wednesday.  Our nation\\'s collective sacrifices and efforts, with a high trust quotient for Government and institutions, saw us through COVID-19 and we came out stronger and more united after COVID than we were before. In a 2022 survey by the Pew Research Centre on how advanced economies were affected by COVID-19, Singapore was found to be less divided, and more united, after coming out of COVID-19. In fact, Singapore was ranked highest by quite a distance. This has in turn led to other positive outcomes, with our unity being a key driver behind the confidence we have in our healthcare system, as well as in our economic outlook and recovery.  Working together, caring for one another, having trust in our institutions – these qualities have seen us through the crisis of a generation. Compared to many other countries, some of which were deeply divided to begin with – they came out even more fractured after the experience. It is therefore vital for us that we continue to grow the reservoir of social capital that we have worked so hard on, over the years, to accumulate.  As various Members have noted in this House, we have long recognised the need for our country to be special, to forge a unique path as a multi-racial and multi-religious society, to be one that celebrates our ethnic diversity as strength, while having a shared sense of belonging and identity. Few societies around the world have succeeded in ensuring its citizens live harmoniously together, let alone one with as much diversity as Singapore. I have no doubt that even as we have done well, and we have; our unity, our ability to stand together, will continuously be tested.We were an unlikely nation to begin with, and perhaps, we still are. We must never lose sight of our roots. In 1965, we were forced out on our own. At that time, we had a diverse population with a Chinese majority. We were surrounded by much larger Muslim majority countries around us. And as Mr Sitoh Yih Pin so emotionally and eloquently shared earlier, those were the founding circumstances of our country.And almost counter intuitively, our founding leaders chose the path of most resistance. We chose to go against the grain and embraced multiculturalism and diverse ethnicities, to recognise and to uplift everyone to make our country a Singapore for all – not just for Chinese, Indians or Malays – and having a space for all religions. It was this bold step, born out of extremely difficult circumstances which became the original seed that has allowed our unique multicultural society to grow, to become more cohesive over the years and to flourish.We will continue to draw strength from that unity. It makes us stronger and it certainly gives us a basis to move forward, and we are stronger than the sum of our parts for that unity.I would add that we did not just proclaim that we want to be a multicultural, multiracial society. We worked hard at it, we worked hard to make this happen, through our policies and through our institutions.Our founding leaders, for instance, set out in our Constitution, the most basic document that we have in Singapore, for the government of the day to always have regard for the interests of our racial and religious minorities. We set up the Presidential Council on Minority Rights (PCMR). In almost no other place in the world is there an institution like the PCMR whose role is to scrutinise legislation after they are passed in this House to ensure that they are not disadvantageous to any particular racial or religious community.We have laws like the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act, which set out clear parameters to deter hate speech and other derogative comments on religious communities. And we do so because we want to ensure that every minority, whether in race or religion, will have the space and freedom to practise their religion and culture as much as possible.Our electoral system guarantees minority representation in Parliament. And by doing so, no political party can prevail by narrowly appealing to only one racial or religious segment of society.Our Ethnic Integration Policy allows us to have a balanced ethnic mix in our public housing so that we do not have racial enclaves like we see in many other countries. This is a policy that has ensured that for all of us, in our lived experience, day-to-day, where we go, where we live, where we do our super-marketing, we will come across a diverse range of different ethnicities at our doorstep in our daily lives. It helps us foster a strong relationship between our people and it shapes who we are and how we approach ethnicity, diversity in Singapore.Yet, even while we have made our diversity a pillar of strength, the uniqueness of Singapore, we must recognise that if we are not careful, it can very quickly become a point of vulnerability.  When a society is as diverse as we are, harmony is not the natural order of things. And it is something that we must constantly work on, to jealously guard it and to be always fearful that it is taken away from us. Around the world today, we see societies becoming more pluralistic; and as they do so, they also become more fractured. The most recent edition of the Edelman Trust Barometer shows that trust continues to decrease in many countries around the world. Not just trust in government, but in all institutions – businesses, the media and even in non-governmental organisations (NGOs). As various Members in this House have said, it is exceptional that Singapore has so far bucked that trend. This global trend of falling trust levels leads to deeper apprehension and suspicion. The shared common space is reduced and divisive ideologies take hold.   These are not just foreign concepts or phenomena; these are developments that affect us in Singapore here as well. The increasing inter-connectedness of the virtual world means that many concerns that were once distant and foreign to us, now have the same immediacy and resonance as much as local ones. As Mr Seah Kian Peng has pointed out, it opens the door to foreign influences seeking to create divisions in our society, to target and to accentuate existing fault lines, or perhaps even create new ones by churning out increasing amounts of emotional, emotive, provocative media, with little or no basis in truth and we must assume that these foreign influences exist here, right here, on our shores.So, we cannot be complacent and take our cherished unity for granted and we cannot for a moment assume that we will be immune to this.This is why our Forward Singapore exercise is so important. One pillar of this exercise is the \"Unite\" pillar, where we bring Singaporeans together to explore what keeps us going as one people.This is, of course, not a new agenda – national unity has been one of our foremost priorities for many years. But aspirations change, challenges are different, they have shifted and the context in which we tackle these issues must also change. And so, we must be alive to all these changes, be cognisant of them and work out what would be the new approach in this new compact to tackle these issues. For instance, how do we create deeper personal, social bonds – particularly in a world that is so digitally connected? How do we nurture what is common between us, while at the same time celebrating our individual diversity? How do we stay united in the face of global headwinds? I have attended several ForwardSG dialogues, met a range of people from different backgrounds, exchanged many views – some of which I will share here. And I must say that overall, I am very encouraged by what I have heard. I have come away with a significantly renewed sense of optimism, that Singaporeans care deeply about that unity, they appreciate how fragile it is and they want to come forward and proactively play a part to contribute to ensure that we do not lose that unity.  One key takeaway is that this unity is not an abstract concept – unity, cohesion, harmony – sometimes, if you do not pay attention, you might think it is just an abstract concept, but it is not. And we achieve it not by ideas alone, but more importantly by having it embedded in our daily lives: part and parcel of what we do, where we go, who we see and the people we socialise and work with.It is realised through these shared experiences, the various social and communal interactions that we may have and the spaces that we have to do so.  I have been Minister at the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) for almost three years now. I started almost three years ago when we were in the thick of COVID-19 – we could not come together, safe distancing measures meant that we had to keep people apart when our very mission was to bring people together. But over the last half a year to a year or so, I have been fortunate to be, in my capacity, at the intersection of so many different touch points of our community, where people from a broad cross section of society come together to pursue their passions.  Whether it is in sports or arts, heritage, culture, language, the youths, the grassroots network, or the various Chinese clans and associations that I meet on a regular basis. All of them come together at the different intersection points and all these sectors of our community represent tremendous opportunities for us to build our social capital and enhance our sense of cohesion and unity. These are the platforms on which people can engage with one another, day to day, and through such interactions, begin to foster deeper relations and build trust and rapport. We cannot force unity and cohesion. But we can institutionally create the environment for people to come together to inter-mix across different fault lines, across different segments of our society. So, let me share some thoughts on what MCCY has done and has in mind, to ensure that we continue to foster this deep sense of unity.First, Mr Murali Pillai, when he spoke, talked about sports as a tremendous opportunity for us to level the playing field. Dr Tan Wu Meng spoke about togetherness and, indeed, all of these are different ways of expressing that we need to have avenues for us to have social mixing between different segments of our society.Key to fostering stronger unity is to have both occasion and opportunity for people from different backgrounds to see and enjoy spending time with one another, through the passions that they pursue so that we are not stratified and constantly in our own social circles only and in our own echo chambers. Stratification is very unhealthy and it can lead to entrenched inter-generational stratification as well if we are not careful. So, we need to break down these barriers, not just along racial or religious lines but also between other fault lines in our society – like local and foreigner, the different income groups, between the young and old, as well as inter-generational conflict. On this note, I am very grateful for the good work that has been done by all many ground-up organisations. I have visited many of them, as I am sure many of my colleagues here have – whether it is the social service agencies or voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs), clan associations, self-help groups and so on. Through their own initiative and effort, people are brought together in a variety of ways. For example, within churches, mosques and temples, and other places of worship. These places of worship might serve a specific religious community, but they are completely agnostic when it comes to running programmes with a broader social reach and impact.Many of our religious institutions work together, to benefit their neighbourhoods and in so doing, provide opportunities for their congregation to inter-mix and to get to know each other. For instance, the Al Mawaddah mosque, Sengkang Methodist Church and Arulmigu Velmurugan Gnanamuneeswarar – and I hope I got that right. ',\n",
       " 'No. [Laughter.]',\n",
       " \"No. My apologies. And I will have to work on that on my pronunciation.They work together constantly – and while I may get the names wrong – they all come from different faiths, but they come together to serve underprivileged residents in the vicinity, the neighbourhood in which they operate. Different faiths bound by a common social purpose.I was recently at the Masjid Kampung Siglap for buka puasa, again, as I am sure many of my colleagues here were. What was special about that occasion? The mosque had invited groups from the surrounding temples and churches, and lay people in the estate to come and join them. And when I chatted with them, I found out that many of them had never seen the inside of a mosque, let alone experience buka puasa. It was a special occasion to be able to share that experience together.Young children who were seeing this for the first time, I am sure, would have been left with a better understanding of the Muslim faith and of the meaning of Muslim practices. And so, the next time they step into a mosque or the next time they engage with a friend who is from the Muslim faith, who is fasting, it no longer feels strange or unknown to them.This how we foster understanding and build unity, bit by bit, at a very micro-level but coming together, stronger than the sum of our parts, as I said.And we want to go beyond just religious tolerance, to a better understanding and appreciation; and grow as a country to embrace differences in our multicultural and multi-religious society. That is after all our aspiration.   To this end, MCCY has also recently refreshed our Racial and Religious Harmony Circles. At the local level, Harmony Circles provide the structures that foster friendships and build mutual respect in local networks. These circles have served us well over the years to bring different stakeholders in our neighbourhoods coming together. But to reach more and newer sections and, perhaps, younger segments of our community, MCCY will further support their efforts to digitise and expand their programme offerings so that we bring more people in to participate and get to know each other. Starting from this year, we will also be dedicating July as our Racial and Religious Harmony Month – not just a day but a month, to highlight the efforts of our Harmony Circles and our community partners and organise more activities to celebrate and to promote racial and religious harmony, so that the significance of the day and of the occasion and the learning points go beyond just spending a day celebrating one another's special occasions – coming in a different attire, perhaps, or costume, celebrating by exchanging goodies and gifts associated with festivities of other races. Going beyond that, to connect with one another through these traditions and share understanding of these traditions, to deepen an understanding and inculcate the value of openness and appreciation.Another step that we are exploring is a joint initiative we will have with the Ministry of Education (MOE). Students, as you know, are allocated to their schools based on their academic merit. But there is no reason why this same configuration should also hold for co-curricular activities (CCAs). So, the Strategic Partnership Co-Curricular Activity (SP-CCA) initiative allows secondary students to join in various CCAs outside of their own schools, increasing the variety of the CCAs that students will have access to.But this initiative has other social benefits. It allows students from different schools, different backgrounds to take part in their chosen CCAs, and helps them to come together outside of school to form friendships. Our students may attend different schools based on the academic curriculum offered, but these non-academic interactions need not be confined by the same terms. So, outside of the subjects they study, they are more enriched when they engage with the wider social network, mix with and form friendships across different schools.Second, as we build a better home for ourselves, staying united as a country also means being inclusive – having a space for all of us.In this debate, we have heard a lot about meritocracy and how we will uplift our workers, our families, our children to ensure equal opportunities for all and how, for certain groups, we will have to actively intervene and shape the environment so that there can be better opportunities for all.At MCCY, there are also several ideas we are pursuing. My colleague, Senior Parliamentary Secretary Eric Chua, spoke on Wednesday about enhancing the landscape for persons with disabilities to alleviate the impediments that they face so they can come along together with us. And beyond that, how we should open up opportunities for persons who are differently abled and differently-interested to fulfil their passions and their potential.For persons with disabilities, one area we would like to spend a bit more time on is in sport. To spur greater sport participation among persons with disabilities, we have updated the Disability Sport Master Plan (DSMP) for this reason. Indeed, as I am sure many Members who have had experience in this sector will attest to, sport can be a transformative tool, especially for persons with disabilities. It allows them to acquire vital social and communication skills, develop confidence about themselves and feel no inferiority complex. Through sport, persons with disabilities are also able to reduce the social stigma associated with their disability and are empowered to realise their potential.Launched in 2016, the DSMP has contributed to increased sport participation rates among persons with disability, rising from 28% in 2015 to 50% in 2019. Our target is 70% by 2030.We will develop pathways for aspiring para-athletes so that there are equal opportunities for talented Singaporeans, with ability or disability, to compete at the highest levels. This includes growing the pool of coaches and better coaching individuals with disabilities by developing their own professional and technical expertise in disability sports.We have also introduced a range of programmes, including learn-to-play programmes and the annual Play Inclusive campaign.The Play Inclusive campaign is where students from both the Special Education and mainstream schools come together. They train together and they compete together in unified sport competitions, for example, in goalball. By playing together on the same team, they bond with each other because they understand each other far better.Our students who participate in these programmes say that these programmes help to normalise what can otherwise be sometimes an awkward situation. It reduces the curious stares and the moments of being overly polite when someone does not quite appreciate the circumstances that they are in. It also allows them to interact in a positive context and challenge assumptions about what they can or cannot do.An inclusive society is also one where diverse skills and talents can be better appreciated and valued and those with these talents have opportunities to develop and to advance.We have done much to open pathways in the arts. The School of the Arts (SOTA), for example, has made it possible to have high quality specialised arts education from the age of 13 and the University of the Arts now allows us to culminate with a degree in the arts in Singapore.We have invested in this to provide a comprehensive arts education so that for those who see this as their strength and as their passion, there will be rich opportunities.We will continue to invest in building up our creative industry to grow a flourishing and globally connected creative economy for the arts through new business models, development pathways and internationalisation opportunities.We are unlocking these new opportunities with the next iteration of Our SG Arts Plan and Our SG Heritage Plan so that we do not just stop at providing added qualifications but also create an entire cultural ecosystem and value chain for those interested to embark on a career and fulfil their aspirations and their potential. I think this is central to our notion of unity.We have also stepped up our support for those who excel in sports by providing pathways through the High Performance Sports system and enabling our TeamSG athletes to perform at their very best.A key part of this ecosystem and this plan is the Sport Excellence Scholarship (spexScholarship) which is offered to our athletes with the potential to excel at major games or world-level events.Take Shanti Pereira, for instance, our national sprinter. Many of you, I am sure, would have been very proud to have seen her break her records, making great strides recently, quite literally.Shanti returned last November to the spexScholarship. She spent some time away from the spexScholarship, but after a while, having discussed with her coach and the National Sports Association (NSA), decided to come back full-time and was supported by the spexScholarship, which grants her an allowance and benefits, and allows her to access support to sport science and sport medicine. She now trains full-time and competes overseas, all supported by the spexScholarship. Her decision, as you know, has paid off well, with her recent performances.We expanded the support so that athletes with the potential can focus full-time on their sporting pursuits and do us proud in Singapore.Beyond supporting our top athletes, we will also enhance the accessibility of our programmes and facilities so that even more can participate in sports, perhaps not just for fitness but also socially, as a platform for bonding and mixing, as Mr Murali Pillai has suggested.Recently, at Budget 2023, I had announced that we will put in an additional $100 of credits in the ActiveSG accounts of children aged four to 12 so that they can start accessing these programmes, not just for fitness but from a social mixing perspective from an early age.Sir, in this House, over the last few days, various Members have highlighted that Singapore's concept of meritocracy could be too narrow. It needs to be refreshed to look beyond academic domains of schools and grades, where diverse skills and talents in non-academic domains such as the sports and arts are also recognised and everyone is given an opportunity to pursue their passion, hone their talents and do their best in their chosen field.We agree with that. That is why at MCCY, our work is focused on opening these different pathways in arts and sports, for instance, for us to celebrate and include those of different merits.Sir, on inclusion, Mr Pritam Singh earlier spoke about the English proficiency test. Let me share my thoughts in this House on the test.Sir, I know many people have different views on this and I respect them. I think there is range for a variety of different views on what weight you might place on this. But my own view is that the knowledge of English at a working level, while helpful, should not be a defining or, indeed, a limiting factor, which might happen if you introduce it as a single-point test.After all, a significant proportion of Singaporeans throughout our history has not been able to speak English well, many of our parents and grandparents amongst them.My own grandmother would not pass this test. She is 96 years old today. She probably still would not pass this test today. But she continues to be a source of joy and value to the family in different ways, many of them intangible. If we had years ago applied this test, then someone like her may not have made it into Singapore. So, we have to think about that as well, as a consideration. That is why I urge this House, as we talk about this and think about this issue, let us not close our hearts to this, but to be open.Mr Pritam Singh said the key is in integration. I think that is the point that I have been emphasising. How do we integrate them? Is a single-point English test the best way of doing this? Or perhaps we look more broadly at the process of integration, which I believe is a long-term process.After all, our Constitution sets out the criteria. You have got to be in Singapore for a period of time as a resident. Integration requires sustained efforts from all parties. It is a holistic approach.Sir, our immigration framework was tightened significantly in 2009 so that a broader range of factors can be considered to assess not just the applicant's ability to contribute but also his or her ability to integrate well into our society and, perhaps also importantly, their commitment to want to sink their roots here.This includes factors such as the length of stay, which I have mentioned, family ties to Singapore and whether the applicant has studied in a national school or done National Service, for example. I believe these are equally, if not perhaps, in some cases, more effective as a marker of integration.We currently do not have a single-point English test or proficiency requirement for naturalisation, unlike some other countries.If you look at Japan, South Korea or the UK, I think they have a language test requirement. It is likely to be because they have a single, more common, more unified operating language.But that is unlike Singapore, which has four different official languages. Indeed, as Mr Pritam Singh would appreciate, the Constitution itself currently provides that one of the markers for naturalisation is working knowledge of any of the four official languages.So, I would not say that English proficiency is not important – I think there is value in that – but let us not make it a single qualifying test or single-point assessment for citizenship.Sir, let me now turn to our youths. The Forward Singapore exercise is about charting our way forward. Youths are an important part of this journey. To forge a viable compact, we must understand as well as support their dreams and aspirations in a completely different paradigm from when we were growing up. We must also give them a stake in Singapore's future and have a voice.Our young people today must come to terms with a myriad of complex world issues – challenges and constraints such as climate change, economic uncertainty, slowing social mobility and they will be growing up in the context of the ageing population that Minister Ong has spoken about. For all of these, there are no easy or quick solutions.Yet, as my colleague Minister of State Alvin Tan and many other Members of this House have articulated, our youths are undaunted. They are not deterred. They have expressed a keen desire, on the contrary, to be a key part of the solution.In my own engagements with the youth, I have found them to be very much seized with the issues of today. They know that the solutions that they can contribute will make an impact on their lives tomorrow.After the President's Address last week, I came across an article in TODAY online. Several youths were interviewed on how they wanted to be involved in nation-building. Some of them made comments and there were reactions which piqued my interest. So, I arranged to meet with a few of them and several other youths to learn and hear for myself first-hand what they were most concerned about, how they saw their role as future leaders and what more we could do to partner with them, to engage them, so that they can be part of that solution.One point which came up was the desire for a more in-depth discourse. They hoped for more details as to how their feedback and suggestions on policies, which were being considered by the Government, might result in some trade-offs that perhaps they had not thought about.We agreed that instead of taking an adversarial approach to policy suggestions, we could perhaps engage on these trade-offs and share views on opportunity costs, develop a deeper understanding of these considerations that would be helpful to making policy suggestions.These were all very constructive suggestions. With this in mind, we will introduce youth panels later this year. Youth panels will be for youths to develop policy recommendations together with the Government, with some differences.They will be youth-led and will be resourced by agencies like the National Youth Council (NYC) and perhaps the appropriate agency, depending on the domain. They will work on a topic or a policy which resonates with the youths of today – something that is topical, that has traction, interest and a fair number of young people support a discussion on the topic. We will share our policy considerations and trade-offs, exchange data points and most importantly, think with them on these questions. Against this backdrop, we will create space for our young people to take the lead in the deliberations and formulate suggestions.Through these panels, we want to engage our youths in meaningful and constructive discourse where they can also listen not just to us in the Government or the agencies, but also to the experience of other people in their position, appreciating that opinions may differ from their own and weighing competing priorities, looking at both the short term as well as having a longer lens perspective of these trade-offs. Together, they will develop policy considerations and present them to the Government.In turn, these recommendations will be taken seriously. We will make a conscious effort to close the loop with them, whatever the outcomes might be. Those which merit further discussion, we will consider for them to be presented here, in Parliament.MCCY can consider sponsoring a White or Green Paper on the proposal so that they can be considered in this House and we can then all have a robust debate on them. Those involved in giving views or preparing the recommendations can see the impact of the work that they do.We are formulating this carefully and more details on these youth panels will be provided when ready. Over the next few months, we will consult with youths on the panels and on the key policy issues that they wish to see under the youth panels. We look forward to the active participation of our youths to shape the future of our country.Sir, I am confident that our youths will welcome this opportunity. I have always been encouraged by the heart that they have in bringing Singapore forward through my interactions with them.Sir, let me now conclude. Earlier this month, President Halimah and I met our Youth Corps leaders at the commencement ceremony of the leaders' programme. One of them, Lim Jia Yi, led a project called We+65. Started in 2022, this project reaches out to the less mobile seniors in Sembawang, with activities that helped to improve their mobility as well as their cognitive functions. And it was borne of her realisation that perhaps the seniors were less connected and had less resources available to them.This was done as part of a volunteering programme with the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) and Blossom Seeds Limited, a charity operating in that area. If you speak to Jia Yi, her sense of responsibility of her commitment to community will shine through clearly. She is passionate about reaching out across generations to befriend seniors, even as she herself is currently a full-time medical student. Busy as she is, she volunteers her time in many other charitable projects and events as well. And while she is young, her leadership was apparent – to bring and convene her fellow youths together to rally them to support her cause.Sir, Jia Yi is remarkable, but she is also not an outlier. She is one of the many Singaporeans who continue to step forward, without being asked, to contribute their time and their treasure. And we will continue to work with people like Jia Yi, striving to be those granules of sand which connect us to the bigger blocks of our society, our institutions and collectively make us stronger across generations, racial and religious groups and across the diversity of our population. When I meet people like Jia Yi, I am reminded that, in fact, we are already different from so many others in the world, with what we have – diversity and harmony that has resulted from a system that structurally fosters equality, social mixing and integration. This is what the wisdom of an earlier generation of leaders have given to us and has allowed us to build on a strong foundation to chase our dreams and fulfil our ambitions. So, let us not throw out what has worked well for us over the years. Sometimes, you must look back, to look forward. And these are the elements, the fundamental building blocks that has made it work for Singapore. To continually work at fostering harmony between diverse communities of different races and faiths, creating opportunities for people of all abilities, talents and interests to excel, powered by a culture of inclusion, care and volunteerism.Sir, the Semangat yang Baru: Forging a New Singapore Spirit exhibition opened yesterday and I went to visit it. I encourage Members here in this House to visit it. It is at the National Museum and it is free for Singaporeans and PRs. It was an evocative and inspiring exhibition; also, thought-provoking. I left it, feeling a deep sense of pride.If there is one lesson that I learnt from this exhibition, it is that as a nation, we do not have much. We never had. We do not have natural resources and we do not have the blessings of a natural hinterland that we can take advantage of or indeed, space – which comes at a significant premium for us.But what we have is our people. We have always had that. We have always done much better, punched above our weight, gone further with our people. And if can continue to stand as one united people, as we declare in our national pledge, then I have no doubt that we will overcome these challenges, with confidence. And we will see a vibrant, thriving Singapore for generations to come. Mr Speaker, I support the Motion. [Applause.]Mr Speaker: Mr Pritam Singh.\",\n",
       " 'I thank Mr Singh for that clarification. And perhaps, with your clarification it now appears that we are not that far apart, because you did use the phrase \"English test\" when you first raised it. I think it was during COS. And so, when I heard your speech then and earlier today, a test is a test you either pass or you fail. And there must be consequences if you do not pass. So, it was in that context that I said let us not use it as a single point consideration. But I am glad we have clarified that, and you are now saying that is one of several factors that we look at.On the survey, I understand, and as I said, it is not an unimportant consideration and I accept that. I think we all want to ensure that we can communicate with the people we see in Singapore, at least to a basic degree. And I can see where that is coming from. I can accept the sentiments conveyed in that survey. It is one survey, yes, but it does reflect sentiments in our society and I think we must take heed of it.But the point about international students, I think, comes from a different perspective. They are taking a qualifying test for a different reason. Because there is an academic element to their entry into the schools in Singapore. So, I do not think one should conflate the two different tests. There are meant for different purposes.Mr Speaker: Mr Murali Pillai.']"

    "\n",
    "About: Minimal keyword extraction technique that leverages BERT embeddings to find key phrases and words in a document. \n",
    "- Based on the principle that the contextual embeddings generated by models like BERT can capture semantic meanings of words and phrases in a way that traditional keyword extraction methods, which often rely on statistical measures, cannot\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Input document embedded using a pre-trained BERT model. You can pick any BERT model your want from 🤗transformers (sidenote: may want to experiment on different versions of BERT; RoBERTa, ELECTRA, AlBERT, DeBERTa, DistilBERT etc. - Turns chunk of text into fixed-sized vector representing semantic aspect of the document\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Keywords and expressions (n-grams) are extracted from the same document using Bag Of Words techniques (such as a TfidfVectorizer or CountVectorizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Each keyword is then embedded into a fixed-size vector with the same model used to embed the document\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now that the keywords and the document are represented in the same space, KeyBERT computes a cosine similarity between the keyword embeddings and the document embedding. Then, the most similar keywords (with the highest cosine similarity score) are extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Includes 2 methods to introduce <b>diversity</b> \n",
    "\n",
    "1 — Max Sum Similarity (MSS)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Setting the top_n argument to a value, say 20. \n",
    "- 2 x top_n keywords are extracted from the document. \n",
    "- Pairwise similarities are computed between these keywords.\n",
    "- Method extracts the most relevant keywords that are the least similar to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2 - Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) ---- explained further later\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitation:\n",
    "- Execution time - large documents and real-time results\n",
    "- Use smaller models like DistilBERT, mixed precision, convert to ONNX format\n",

    "Why it need to be enhanced? \n",
    "https://towardsdatascience.com/enhancing-keybert-keyword-extraction-results-with-keyphrasevectorizers-3796fa93f4db\n",
    "  \n",
    "REPO: https://github.com/TimSchopf/KeyphraseVectorizers\n",
    "1. Users need to predefine a word n-gram range to specify the length of extracted keyphrases - Users usually dont know optimal n-gram range; need to experiement; grammatical sentence structures are not considered at all - “day keeps” or “keeps the doctor” - not relevant\n",
    "2. KeyBERT then extracts simple word n-grams of the defined length from documents and uses them as candidate keyphrases for embedding creation and similarity calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "How to enhance \n",
    "- KeyphraseVectorizers package extracts keyphrases with part-of-speech patterns from a collection of text documents and converts them into a document-keyphrase matrix.\n",
    "- Matematical matrix describes frequency of keyphrases occuring in collection of documents\n",
    "\n",
    "How KeyphaseVectorizer package work?\n",
    "1. Document texts are annotated with spaCy part-of-speech tags\n",
    "2. Keyphrases are extracted from the document texts whose part-of-speech tags match a predefined regex pattern\n",
    "3. Vectorizers(Default, the vectorizers extract keyphrases with zero or more adjectives, followed by one or more nouns using the English spaCy part-of-speech tags) calculate document-keyphrase matrices                                                         \n",

    "1) Extract the top n representative documents per topic\n",
    "2) Randomly sample a number of candidate documents per cluster which is controlled by the nr_samples parameter\n",
    "3) Top n representative documents are extracted by calculating the c-TF-IDF representation for the candidate via <b>cosine similarity </b> closest to the topic c-TF-IDF representation\n",
    "4) The top n words per topic are extracted based on their c-TF-IDF representation, which is controlled by the nr_repr_docs parameter \n",
    "5) Extract the embeddings for words and representative documents and create topic embeddings by averaging the representative documents\n",
    "6) Most similar words to each topic are extracted by calculating the cosine similarity between word and topic embeddings\n",

    "### MaximalMarginalRelevance (MMR)\n",
    "\n",
    "About - MMR considers the similarity of keywords/keyphrases with the document, along with the similarity of already selected keywords and keyphrases. This results in a selection of keywords that maximize their within diversity with respect to the document\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "https://medium.com/tech-that-works/maximal-marginal-relevance-to-rerank-results-in-unsupervised-keyphrase-extraction-22d95015c7c5\n",
    "- Tries to reduce redundancy and increase diversity in the result and is used in text summarization\n",
    "- MMR selects the phrase in the final keyphrases list according to a combined criterion of query relevance and novelty of information\n",
    "- Considers the similarity of keyphrase with the document, along with the similarity of already selected phrases\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Advantage:</b>\n",
    "1. Balance Between Relevance and Diversity: MMR effectively balances relevance with diversity, ensuring that the selected items are not just relevant but also varied. This is particularly useful in search engines and summarization tasks where presenting diverse perspectives or aspects is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Disadvatnage:</b>\n",
    "1. Computational cost\n",
    "2. Potential Loss of Highly Relevant Items: In its effort to maintain diversity, MMR might exclude some highly relevant items in favor of less relevant but more diverse ones. This trade-off might not always be desirable, depending on the context.\n",
    "3. Subjectivity in Diversity: What constitutes \"diversity\" can be subjective and context-dependent. Defining and quantifying diversity appropriately for a given application can be challenging."

      "BEFORE SUMMARIZATION: Thank you, Mr Chairman.I speak as Chairman of our Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change (IMCCC). The IMCCC works very closely with the various ministries, and the ministries, in turn, work very closely with the sectors that they are responsible for, and in particular, we work very closely with Minister Grace Fu and the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE).Today I will give a broad overview and each of the Ministries will elaborate, in detail, on the plans that they have specifically.Reducing global greenhouse gas emissions is urgent. The Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change's Sixth Assessment Report warns that after 2030, it will become increasingly difficult to limit global warming to 2°C and we will face heightened and more complex climate risks.At COP26 in Glasgow, countries pledged to act. But recent conditions have made it more difficult to stay the course. Russia's invasion of Ukraine, exactly a year ago, disrupted energy and food supplies, causing energy and food prices to increase in many countries.Despite these external challenges, Singapore decisively stepped up our efforts against climate change last year. In Budget 2022, we announced Singapore's intention to raise our climate ambition. In October, after several months of public consultation, we formally revised our climate targets. We will reduce our emissions to around 60 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2030, after peaking our emissions earlier. We also committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.Ms Poh Li San asked about the considerations for raising our ambition – after all, we also are affected by external events and Singapore, as a small, alternative energy disadvantaged city-state, faces natural limitations on our climate action measures.Mr Chairman, first, climate change is an existential threat for us here in Singapore. As a low-lying island, we are vulnerable to rising sea levels. Being densely built-up, we are prone to trapping heat in our urban environment. Climate change poses risks to our biodiversity, food and water security, and public health.To mitigate climate change effects on Singapore, we must engage other countries to reduce their emissions worldwide. We must do our best and do our part, so that we can shape international norms to bring us closer to our collective goals.Finally, putting our climate ambition into action positions Singapore as a choice location for businesses and investors interested in participating in the regional green economy. This puts us in good stead to capture new economic opportunities in the climate transition.Ms Poh Li San, Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Mr Louis Ng asked how we will meet our climate targets. The Government, through IMCCC, strikes a balance between ambition and practicality of action. And it will take a whole-of-nation effort. The Green Plan sets out how the Government, businesses and the community can work together towards a greener future.The public sector will set the example by aiming to achieve net-zero emissions around 2045, five years ahead of our national target of 2050. This year, we will enhance our public procurement strategy and start making regular progress reports on public sector sustainability initiatives. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) and MSE will provide further details to this House.We will also continue to forge international collaborations on climate action. Prof Koh Lian Pin asked about the significance of COP27 and COP28. Let me share two positive examples of how Singapore contributed and made a difference.At both COP26 and COP27, Minister Grace Fu co-facilitated negotiations on Article 6. The Article 6 rulebook enables cross-border cooperation through carbon markets, for countries to jointly fulfil their national climate targets, making it more efficient and easier for countries to reduce their climate emissions and on a global level.The inaugural Singapore Pavilion at COP27 showcased our homegrown companies, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), youths and academics, including Prof Koh, to the international community. For instance, Sembcorp Industries launched its carbon management platform, GoNetZero. And one of GoNetZero's partnerships, with OCBC Bank, encourages clean energy adoption and decarbonisation, starting with Singaporean companies and scaling up to the region. Overall, COP27 advanced workstreams to support the implementation of the Paris Agreement. And we will press on at COP28.Mr Chairman, government action is necessary but not sufficient to achieve a low-carbon future. Businesses need to act as well, and we will partner them in their sustainability journeys. The industry sector contributes over 60% of our overall carbon emissions. So, to reach net zero by 2050, we must decarbonise at every level – the economy, each sector and individual firms – so that our businesses are ready to thrive in the green economy.Our carbon tax shapes economy-wide behaviour. The Government has specified carbon tax levels up to 2027 and a range of $50 to $80 per tonne of CO2 by 2030. All of us must now factor in the cost of emitting carbon. And now that the carbon tax levels are known, companies can also plan with greater predictability.This will make greener modes of production, investment and living more desirable. The carbon tax collected will continue to support businesses and households. We will invest in green technologies and infrastructure, extend energy efficiency grants to businesses, and cushion our lower- and middle-income households from the impact of the carbon tax on electricity prices with U-Save rebates.The Government will enable the energy transition by securing greener sources of energy. Our National Hydrogen Strategy lays out the roadmap for the use of hydrogen which, with technological advancements, could potentially supply up to half of our power needs by 2050. In the meantime, we continue to see how we can import green electrons.Mr Louis Ng asked about support for industry. Aside from economy-wide moves, such as carbon tax and decarbonising our grid, we will also help sectors reorient towards greener production and develop competitive advantages in growth sectors.As a financial hub, Singapore has a head start in green financing services. Our industry sectoral roadmaps consolidate common challenges, allowing scale-up of promising initiatives and guide companies in positioning themselves to capture opportunities. The Ministry of Transport (MOT) and Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) will update this House on the sustainability plans for the transport and tourism sectors respectively.Every business, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), must be financially and environmentally sustainable in order to thrive in the long run, by decarbonising their value chains and accelerating their green transition. MTI will report on how we are helping SMEs to level up in areas, such as sustainability reporting and carbon accounting.Small companies can drive sustainability efforts across their supply chains. One example is DTC World, a local SME specialising in corporate gifts. It champions sustainable procurement and promotes sustainable consumption and it has received multiple corporate sustainability awards. So, SMEs also can do their part.Finally, Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked how the Government ensures that opportunities and good jobs for Singaporeans will be there amid the green transition. Many Singaporeans are passionate about sustainability – not many more than Mr Louis Ng. We will support you in challenging your passion towards making an impact.For Singaporeans who may not yet have internalised climate change, understanding the implications of climate change on the environment and our society is the first step. The Ministry of Education (MOE) will elaborate on how we will nurture our young to become eco-stewards and live sustainably, with a focus on food sustainability in 2023.We will also support Singaporeans to acquire green skills and improve their access to green job opportunities. MTI will describe how we will do so with industry players and training partners.Mr Chairman, Sir, global climate action is urgent. All countries, including Singapore, must honour our shared responsibility for our planet earth. The IMCCC takes a whole-of-nation view to make sure our efforts are comprehensive and coordinated. Businesses, communities and individuals have a key part to play.The climate transition will be challenging, but it will be a rewarding journey, with opportunities for us to innovate and reimagine a greener and more sustainable future. So, let us work together, towards a better and greener Singapore.The Chairman: Ms Mariam Jaafar. Mr Chairman, over the last 58 years, we made the journey from mudflats to Metropolis. Now, coming out of a global pandemic, we are poised to embark on the next stage of our city's transformation. Building on the ideas, hopes, aspirations and dreams of Singaporeans, conveyed to us through extensive engagements, as well as based on Government planning, future Singapore will be one that is inclusive, sustainable, resilient and endearing.Planning for the future requires us to think long term. In mid-2021, MND and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) launched the Long-Term Plan Review, which mapped out our land use strategies to guide Singapore's development for the next 50 years and beyond.This included an extensive engagement with Singaporeans to hear their thoughts on these strategies, as Senior Minister of State Sim Ann mentioned in the COS 2022. Mr Cheng Hsing Yao, Miss Cheryl Chan and Ms Nadia Samdin have asked for an update on this.Since then, URA had engaged over 15,000 people from all walks of life. Through this process, we found that we sometimes have different needs and aspirations, and therefore, must make trade-offs. It is part and parcel of land use planning, given that Singapore has limited land. Our collective aspirations and potential strategies to achieve them, were featured in URA's Space for our Dreams exhibition in 2022, which was visited by close to 50,000 people, with 150,000 views on URA's website. Let me share some of the key takeaways from the public engagement and how we are translating them into long-term strategies for our future city. First, it is evident that Singaporeans take pride in our identity and heritage. While we cannot conserve each and every older building, we nevertheless want to feel that sense of familiarity and connection as we walk through our streets.Today, we already carefully consider how to safeguard our heritage as a key part of urban planning. In the last 30 years, over 7,200 heritage buildings and structures have been conserved. Beyond individual buildings, we also enhance familiar neighbourhoods and shape new places to make them memorable.We will reinforce this through Identity Corridors, where we will use urban and streetscape design to enhance the character of historic trunk roads, such as the Historic East corridor that cuts across Joo Chiat and Geylang Serai.Second, it is clear that we love nature and greenery. But, at the same time, there is both need and demand for development. Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin asked how we would balance the two.We take a science-based approach to identify ecologically important sites and prioritise them for conservation. For example, through National Parks Board (NParks)'s Ecological Profiling Exercise, we have gained a better understanding of Singapore's ecological connectivity and have identified key ecological corridors on our land and in our waters.However, given our physical constraints, we need to balance demands across a wide variety of needs, including housing, community amenities and workplaces. There may be some greenfield sites that we need to safeguard as options for development. But Singaporeans can be assured that any decision to proceed will only be made after we have carefully studied the trade-offs and alternatives in close coordination with the relevant agencies. Where necessary, we will also undertake environmental studies and formulate mitigation measures.The Government will also engage and involve stakeholders. In response to Prof Koh Lian Pin, for proposed developments that require an Environmental Impact Assessment, we seek views from academics, stakeholder groups and the public on the findings where applicable. The reports are also made publicly available online, unless there are reasons to maintain confidentiality, such as security considerations. In these cases, we will consider whether the full report can be made public and the disclosure modality, such as, for example, making it available for hard copy viewing. And we do recognise that some may face difficulties accessing hardcopy reports. Where possible, we will provide accommodations, such as by extending the duration of the public feedback period. All feedback is carefully considered and incorporated into the final report and our plans where relevant.Third, some participants shared concerns on how Singapore will adapt to the increasingly complex and ambiguous global environment, something which Mr Cheng Hsing Yao also spoke about. To cater for the uncertainties of the future, we continuously monitor trends, such as an ageing population, to evolving geopolitical tensions, and shifts in the global economic outlook. This enables us to consider a range of possibilities and plan ahead to enhance our resilience.Ms Carrie Tan suggested we review the allocation of land to various uses, such as residential and commercial, to factor in evolving trends, such as changes to live-work patterns.Indeed, this is something we currently do and will continue to do. For example, in developing plans for areas, such as the Greater Southern Waterfront, we intentionally keep our plans flexible and pace out their development. This is so that we can adjust the mix of uses to respond to changing trends and needs.The Long-Term Plan Review, as the name indicates, sets out our goals in the long-term, that is, to say, a 50-year timeframe or so. However, in order to get there, we will have to start giving effect to these strategies and plans over the next 10 to 15 years. This exercise is known as the Masterplan Review and it will provide detailed land use and development plans covering sites all over Singapore, from major transformation areas, such as the Greater Southern Waterfront and Paya Lebar Airbase, to residential towns, neighbourhoods and our heartlands.The Masterplan presents an opportunity to plan ways to improve our living environment together. As highlighted by Ms Nadia Samdin, we will provide various avenues to engage Singaporeans of all ages and from all walks of life, to share their views on our national and local plans. This will be done over the next two to three years. In response to Mr Cheng Hsing Yao and Miss Cheryl Chan, URA is currently working on the key ideas, but allow me share some of the strategies that the Masterplan will be built upon.First, the Masterplan will be centred on liveable towns. As we plan for a new generation of towns, such as the ones that Paya Lebar Airbase will make way for and rejuvenate our older ones, we will pay close attention to making them more liveable for everyone.Ms Poh Li San asked about plans to spread out amenities to better serve residential estates across Singapore. It remains our priority to make every housing estate a desirable place to live in. We will continue to ensure that our estates are planned with a range of housing options, served by a wide variety of amenities that meet our residents' needs and preferences and are highly accessible.Second, the Masterplan will work within our land and resource constraints, a necessity for a small city like Singapore. One way is to recycle our brownfield sites. There are also ongoing efforts to increase and optimise our underground space, as highlighted by Miss Cheryl Chan. Where possible, we place infrastructure, such as transport, utilities and storage spaces underground to free up aboveground space for housing, recreational spaces and other people-centric uses.We will also repurpose existing buildings, as Prof Koh Lian Pin highlighted.Today, we have incentives to encourage adaptive reuse. State properties are put to various uses, from residential to lifestyle. During COVID-19, many were activated as quarantine facilities. There are also incentives for owners who renovate their conserved buildings to meet modern uses while enhancing the building character, such as additional floor area and tax concessions. However, there will still be situations where redevelopment is needed.In such cases, we have incentives to minimise emissions, such as BCA's Green Mark certification scheme that recognises redevelopment projects that conserve existing structures and reuse or recycle demolished materials.Several Members also suggested repurposing under-utilised spaces for new uses. Assoc Prof Jamus Lim asked if the lowest floor of multi-storey car parks can be repurposed for bicycle parking, echoing a similar call made earlier by Mr Edward Chia in November 2022.For some public housing developments, bicycle parking is provided at the void deck for our residents' convenience. To optimise space at void decks, HDB also plans to install 40,000 dual bicycle racks, which can each hold two bicycles in 23 existing HDB towns by 2025.Multi-storey carparks with under-utilised space are currently used for various activities. One example is urban farming. We do not generally co-locate bicycle parking in car parks as this could pose safety issues to cyclists, especially where cars and bicycles have to use the same lanes. However, if a request is made by any precinct for this, HDB will consider on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration other competing uses for the carparks and whether the safety concerns and any other relevant considerations can be adequately addressed.Ms Jessica Tan, Ms Carrie Tan, Miss Cheryl Chan and Mr Liang Eng Hwa suggested partnering the community to co-create shared spaces, such as permaculture plots or pilots.Today, there are opportunities for Singaporeans to co-create community projects, leveraging URA's and HDB's Lively Places Programme. Many projects are in under-utilised spaces, including a void deck garden in Bishan.NParks' initiatives' such as Friends of the Parks and the Community in Bloom movement also encourage the local community to play a part in designing, developing and managing green spaces, while HDB and SFA's urban farms at 14 multi-storey car park rooftops contribute to food security.For permaculture farms to meaningfully enhance food security, they should be done on a commercial scale. Given the sizeable amount of land required, it is more practical to encourage community gardeners to adopt permaculture principles. Nevertheless, Town Councils have the autonomy to determine how common property can be utilised, subject to our laws and HDB's consent. We are happy to consider proposals that enhance food security and sustainability, where appropriate.As Prof Koh Lian Pin highlighted, there are diverse and competing needs for our sea space as well. We carefully plan our sea space to meet Singapore's needs.Today, most sea space within our port limits are used by the maritime and port industry. We also set aside space for other uses, including marine biodiversity conservation, aquaculture, utilities and recreation. For instance, we have safeguarded Marine Nature Areas and Marine Parks at our Southern Islands in URA's Parks and Waterbodies Plan. To optimise our sea space, we will continue working with relevant stakeholders to explore co-locating synergistic uses, such as siting of solar panels together with fish farms along the East Johor Straits. These ideas, plans and strategies will eventually culminate in URA's presentation of their next draft Masterplan, which will be open for public feedback. I strongly encourage all Singaporeans to participate and share your views.Next, let me zoom in one level deeper and speak about our plans to rejuvenate HDB estates, which are a big part of our residents' day-to-day lived experiences. As our nation gets older, so do our towns. But this does not mean that they cannot continue to be vibrant and liveable. In response to Ms Poh Li San, HDB crowdsources ideas from residents to renew and rejuvenate existing HDB towns and estates under the Remaking Our Heartland programme. This spans from upgrading our town and Neighbourhood Centres to opening new community spaces and parks.Ms Joan Pereira and Mr Ang Wei Neng asked about plans to maintain and upgrade older flats. I would like to assure Singaporeans that we are committed to giving due priority to rejuvenating our estates, for the safety and comfort of our residents. All flats above 30 years would have already undergone the Main Upgrading Programme (MUP) in the past or will be selected for the  by 2030 subject to the Government's fiscal position. The next round of upgrading for these flats would be around 60 to 70 years of age. In between, we provide support to flat owners for in-flat maintenance issues, such as repairing ceiling leaks under the Goodwill Repair Assistance.Besides upgrading, redevelopment is another way to rejuvenate older areas. On Ms Joan Pereira's question about the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme, or SERS, we shared that most projects with high redevelopment potential have already been selected for SERS and we do not expect many more sites to be eligible. As Minister Desmond has mentioned earlier, we are also working on our plans for the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme, or VERS. More households will be able to benefit from redevelopment before their leases expire and we can renew our towns progressively and create a refreshed living environment with new homes and updated amenities for residents. We will share more details with Singaporeans when ready.Several Members also asked about HIP's drying racks. The external retractable clothes drying rack that Mr Ang Wei Neng spoke about is designed to maximise laundry capacity while ensuring user safety. Each of the six poles in the rack measures up to 1.7 metres in usable length, to accommodate large items like bedsheets. HDB will continue ways to look for ways to increase the rack's laundry capacity.On Mr Muhamad Faisal Abdul Manap's suggestion to extend the installation of HIP's laundry hanging rack to flats which do not qualify for the programme, we can consider this when there is sufficient demand.Allow me to respond to Mr Ang Wei Neng and Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong's cuts on lift upgrading. As of January 2023, there are only about 140 HDB blocks with units without direct access to lifts on the same floor. This is due to technical and site constraints or high costs, some of which exceed $100,000 per unit. HDB continues to explore technical methods, though these are still nascent. We will also continue to review requests for lift upgrading, bearing in mind costs, space constraints and technical feasibility.Mr Dennis Tan has asked about the Lift access Housing Grant (LHG) which provides up to $30,000 to help residents buy another flat with lift access. A key condition for this grant is that residents need direct lift access due to medical or mobility issues. Of those who have applied, the approval rate is high, at close to 90%. As our residents aged, we do expect take-up to increase as they face medical or mobility conditions.Flat owners who have bought another flat with the grants can sell their existing flat on the open market. Hence, there is no need for HDB to buy them back. If they have difficulties selling the existing flat, HDB can grant a time extension on a case-by-case basis. HDB will continue to monitor the situation and assess if further enhancements to the grant are necessary.Prof Koh Lian Pin asked about our efforts to keep older estates cool as temperatures rise and how we will use the findings from Cooling Singapore 2.0.  HDB has several initiatives under the Green Towns Programme to reduce ambient temperatures, such as: Introducing greenery to the top decks of selected multi-storey car parks in the form of urban farms, community gardens or rooftop greenery.There is also an ongoing pilot on cool paint.Where possible, such as for newer towns like Tengah, we adopt new technologies such as the Centralised Cooling System, which provides a more energy-efficient cooling solution than conventional air-conditioning systems.We will continue to invest in R&D to deepen our knowledge on urban heat. This includes Cooling Singapore 2.0, an ongoing project where a digital model simulating our urban climate will help us understand the impact of urban heat locally and assess heat mitigation strategies. Mr Chong Kee Hiong spoke about the need to educate residents on fire safety and provide safety features in HDB flats and estates.Since 2018, SCDF’s Fire Code requires every new flat and existing flat undergoing major renovation to install fire alarms. As optional improvements under HIP, HDB also offers installations of a Home Fire Alarm Device. HDB and SCDF are further embarking on a trial to place and maintain one fire extinguisher at a lift lobby of every two HDB blocks.Out of the 934 cases of residential fire last year, 783 took place in HDB flats, which reflects the proportion of public housing in Singapore. Today, SCDF conducts public education campaigns, including door-to-door engagements with residents and educating new homeowners on fire safety together with HDB. Currently, all flat owners who are taking or have an existing HDB loan to buy their flats are required to be covered under basic fire insurance. An HDB-appointed company provides basic coverage and the premiums payable by flat owners range between $1.63 and $8.18 only, for a five-year coverage.Let me now touch on another important priority for us – transforming Singapore into a . This vision is a key pillar of the Singapore Green Plan 2030. It underscores our strong desire to conserve and extend our natural capital – for the benefit of the environment and for the benefit of our people. Miss Cheryl Chan asked for updates on our progress on this front.First, we have continued to establish new green spaces and to enhance existing ones.For instance, last November, we opened the Rifle Range Nature Park. It serves as an ecological buffer to protect the rich biodiversity in the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and creates more opportunities for families to enjoy nature-based recreation.Between now and 2030, we have six more nature parks in the pipeline that Singaporeans can look forward to. This includes the Lim Chu Kang Nature Park, which we will be opening later this year. It will feature a variety of natural habitats such as mangroves, woodlands and grasslands, as well as a restored colonial-era bungalow for those who lover heritage. Singaporeans can also soon enjoy the northern section of the Lakeside Garden in Jurong Lake Gardens. It will offer a youth park with skating facilities and panoramic views across Jurong Lake. We are also enhancing our existing green spaces to make them more inclusive. For example, we currently have 10 Therapeutic Gardens, which are specially designed to improve the physical and mental well-being of people across a diverse range of physical abilities and health conditions. This includes three that we launched over the past year, and we will add 20 more by 2030. Second, we are pressing on with efforts to restore nature into our urban landscape.Today, we have around 155 hectares of skyrise greenery, equivalent to almost 220 football fields. We are on track to meet our target of 200 hectares by 2030.Ms Nadia Samdin asked about our efforts to green industrial estates. Since 2020, we have more than doubled the number of trees in our industrial estates, from 90,000 to 180,000 today. By 2030, these estates will have around 260,000 trees. These will cool the environment and beautify the area for the people who work there.Third, we are strengthening the connectivity between green spaces. For example, we opened the northern stretch of the Rail Corridor last month, completing over 21 kilometres of green, continuous north-south connectivity. In total, we have completed over 180 kilometres of Nature Ways and 375 kilometres of park connectors, putting us on track to achieve our goal for all households to be within a 10-minute walk from a park by 2030. This increases Singaporeans’ access to nature and strengthens our ecosystems’ resilience, by facilitating the movement of biodiversity between habitats.This brings me to our efforts to conserve our native plant and animal species, which Ms Nadia Samdin asked about.We have crossed the three-quarter mark of our 2030 species recovery target, with 82 plant and 42 animal species covered today. This includes the endemic Singapore Ginger and the Singapore Freshwater Crab. We have also restored and enhanced over 30 hectares of forest, coastal, and marine habitats, well ahead of our target to do so by 2030. This was made possible through the contributions of our volunteers, who help with planting native trees and shrubs, and removing invasive species.To provide more conducive habitats for our native biodiversity to thrive, we will raise our ambitions on this front. We now aim to restore 80 hectares of forest, coastal, and marine habitats by 2030, by intensifying the planting of native species and encouraging the establishment of native animal populations. As we push on with our greening efforts, Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Mr Xie Yao Quan have asked how we can involve even more members of the community. This year marks 60 years since then-Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew kickstarted our greening journey by launching our first nation-wide tree-planting campaign in 1963. Under the OneMillionTrees movement, we have partnered more than 75,000 members of the community to plant over 500,000 trees since 2020.We have planted native rainforest species in our forests to strengthen the ecological resilience of these habitats, so that they can better support our native biodiversity.The planted trees also help to intensify greenery and strengthen ecological connectivity along our streetscapes, Nature Ways and park connectors.To commemorate this milestone year, we will create more tree-planting opportunities under the OneMillionTrees movement and we hope that you will join us in celebrating this milestone.We will also continue to engage Singaporeans on the conservation and celebration of our natural heritage.Through our  Conversations, we were inspired by members of the community who shared and worked on ideas to encourage more residents to participate in our efforts.This included ideas for community stewards to organise nature-based activities, such as biodiversity surveys, and to curate educational resources on the benefits of  through experiential learning.We will continue to grow our base of over 60,000 volunteers and over 11,000 citizen scientists.We will reach out to more youths through platforms such as our Youth Stewards for Nature programme, to nurture future volunteers and stewards of our natural heritage.Mr Xie Yao Quan and Miss Cheryl Chan have also asked about our research and development (R&D) efforts in urban sustainability. We are collaborating closely with industry and academic partners to support our key initiatives under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, including our  ambitions. Under the Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 Plan, we have set aside close to $270 million for research to address new challenges in areas such as climate change. One of the research programmes funded under RIE 2025 is the Marine Climate Change Science programme, for which we have started to award grants. One looks at developing ecological and microbial solutions to enhance the resilience of coral reefs to climate change. Another looks at building up the foundational science for blue carbon accounting in Singapore.We also recently launched the first grant call under the  research vertical of the Cities of Tomorrow programme. These research projects will help us deepen our scientific foundations and develop evidence-based management practices. So, I look forward to active participation in our grant call. The years ahead are going to be very exciting ones as we shape our future city together.The MND family looks forward to working with all Singaporeans on this transformation journey and to making Singapore a place we are proud to call home. [Applause.]The Chairman: Senior Minister of State Sim Ann. Mr Chairman, before I address the cuts filed by Members, I would like to thank many Members who spoke on sustainability during the Budget debate. In particular, Prof Koh Lian Pin's call for climate change and sustainability to always be among the bread-and-butter issues we focus on. And Ms Carrie Tan's motto to Share More, Use Less, Waste Not, resonated with me. Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean also spoke about our raised climate ambition and the urgent need for climate action. He explained that a whole-of-nation effort was needed to transition to a greener future. This nationwide effort is underpinned by the Singapore Green Plan 2030, which we launched two years ago. The Green Plan charts bold and concrete policies and actions for Singapore to achieve our net-zero emissions goal. It serves as a critical compass on our path to sustainability. My colleagues from other Ministries have been or will be providing updates on their green plan initiatives over the Committee of Supply (COS) debate.We must press on with this intergenerational effort to steward a green, liveable and climate-resilient home for Singaporeans and our future generations. Today, my colleagues from the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) and I will share how we are laying the foundations for a green nation that is Climate-Resilient and Climate-Friendly. First, I will elaborate on how we are leading, enabling and facilitating Singapore's transition to a climate-friendly nation. The public sector will lead the way for Singapore's decarbonisation journey and pave the way for green efforts to take root. Under the GreenGov.SG initiative, the public sector has committed to achieving net-zero emissions around 2045, five years ahead of our national target. Prof Koh Lian Pin and Mr Don Wee asked for a progress update.To spearhead the effort, we have appointed Singapore's first Government Chief Sustainability Officer (GCSO). Each Ministry has also appointed a Chief Sustainability Officer to oversee sustainability matters across their Ministry family. They will work closely with the GCSO to develop and coordinate strategies to meet this ambition.Our public sector agencies are pushing ahead with decarbonising their systems and processes. For instance, the National Environment Agency (NEA) is working with Keppel Seghers on a joint feasibility study to capture carbon dioxide emitted from Waste-to-Energy plants. Ms Poh Li San asked about PUB's decarbonisation plans and solutions. PUB has also committed to achieve net-zero emissions around 2045, in line with our GreenGov.SG ambition. Their decarbonisation strategy is underpinned by 3Rs – Reduce, Replace and Remove. First, PUB will reduce carbon emissions by improving the efficiency of energy-intensive processes such as desalination and NEWater. It targets to reduce the energy consumption for desalination from 3.5 to less than 2 kilowatt-hour per cubic meter by 2025. PUB's upcoming Tuas Water Reclamation Plant (WRP) will be fully energy self-sufficient by harnessing synergies with NEA's Integrated Waste Management Facility.Next, PUB will also replace carbon-based energy sources with renewable energy, including solar. We are already home to one of the world's largest floating solar farms at Tengeh Reservoir. We are deploying the next floating solar farms at Pandan Reservoir and plan to call the tender for this later this year.PUB is also exploring innovative technologies to remove carbon. In partnership with the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), PUB is test-bedding the use of novel electrolysis technology to capture carbon dioxide in seawater as part of the desalination process. This will produce hydrogen and pre-treated seawater so that it can be desalinated at lower energy. Mr Don Wee and Miss Cheryl Chan will be pleased to hear that from this financial year onwards, the Government will publish an annual GreenGov.SG report, the report will show our efforts, progress and plans. We will start with reporting Scope 1 and 2 emissions, electricity and water consumption with reference to international standards and frameworks.From FY2024, all Statutory Boards will also make their annual environmental sustainability disclosures. Several statutory boards have started making sustainability disclosures. They have been systematically incorporating sustainability in their decision-making and risk management frameworks to achieve concrete sustainability outcomes. As Mr Don Wee, Mr Louis Ng and Prof Koh pointed out, the public sector can drive the nation's transition to a green economy by leveraging on its procurement budget. Let me elaborate on our plans for green procurement in the public sector.The public sector has adopted green procurement since 2007. Thus far, we have introduced sustainability requirements for selected goods and services. For example, Information and Communications Technology (ICT) equipment, electrical appliances and printing paper must first meet environmental standards before they are assessed on price and quality attributes. Building on this foundation, we intend to raise the bar. Starting from 2024, besides pre-qualifying the products on environmental standards, we will also consider the sustainability practices of the company we buy from. As announced by Senior Minister of State for Finance, Mr Chee Hong Tat, we will start with large construction and ICT tenders. These make up more than 60% of the value of Government procurement contracts. Such projects include public infrastructure, industrial buildings and office ICT equipment contracts.Using ICT as an example, in addition to the requirement of matching the best-in-class in energy efficiency, we may evaluate the efforts of the tenderers in reducing packaging and carbon footprint of their operations, when we evaluate the tender bids. As this is a new concept, we will start with setting aside up to 5% of the evaluation points for environmental sustainability. We will review the amount and engage industry closely as we expand the adoption of sustainability criteria to more public sector procurement sectors. Mr Don Wee asked if such efforts to green the public sector will entail additional costs. Environmental sustainability is not costless and we will have to pay a bit more for greener goods and services. But as the world decarbonises, the demand for green products and services will grow.And green procurement in the public sector will encourage suppliers to adopt sustainability practices and develop green products and services. Thereby, enhancing the growth of the green economy in Singapore and the competitiveness of our companies globally. The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) had outlined initiatives that support businesses in adopting sustainability practices, such as measuring carbon emissions sustainability reporting and seizing opportunities in the green economy. I hope that these initiatives under GreenGov.SG will spur many in the private sector to follow suit, in publishing their own sustainability reports and incorporating sustainability considerations in their procurement policies. Together as a nation, we can transform our economy.  This leads me to talk about enabling the transformation through partnering businesses and the community. Building a green nation requires the participation of all – businesses, communities and persons. The Government cannot do it alone and all of us must work closely alongside each other, as partners, to deliver on the Green Plan.We will be raising our carbon tax progressively over the next few years to further incentivise carbon and energy efficiency throughout the economy and society. The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) had addressed queries on allowances under the transition framework that Miss Cheryl Chan asked about. As raised by Prof Koh, we will allow companies to use high-quality international carbon credits or ICCs, to offset up to 5% of their taxable emissions. We will publish a whitelist of acceptable ICCs later this year, which will include eligible host countries, carbon crediting programmes and methodologies. Businesses should do more with less. Creating more products and services with less resources and less waste will raise their competitiveness in the long run, particularly against higher carbon and energy prices. Businesses must invest in energy efficient equipment or manufacturing processes. Some upfront costs may be incurred. However, over the long run, lower energy and resource use will lead to lower costs over the equipment's lifecycle. Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked about the support provided for businesses, including SMEs, in making this upfront investment. We recognise that upfront capital investment can be challenging for our businesses, particularly SMEs. To support an inclusive transition, we will help SMEs make the switch. Enterprise Singapore introduced the Energy Efficiency Grant (EEG) for food services, food manufacturing and retail sectors last year. NEA also enhanced the Energy Efficiency Fund (E2F) for manufacturing companies to invest in energy efficient equipment. One SME that benefited from the enhanced E2F is ACP Metal Finishing Private Limited (ACP), which specialises in metal surface treatments and finishes. ACP tapped on the enhanced E2F to replace over a thousand fluorescent lightings in its facilities with more energy efficient LED lightings. The E2F funded 70% of the $60,000 project cost. With these retrofits, the company improved the energy efficiency of its operations. They enjoyed annual energy savings of about $30,000 which represents a payback period of less than a year with support from the E2F.I am happy to announce that we will further enhance the Energy Efficiency Fund to provide manufacturing companies with certainty of the grant amount, upfront, when they invest in energy efficient equipment. We will also further simplify the grant application process by streamlining the measurement and verification requirements. I encourage eligible companies, particularly our SMEs to tap the enhanced scheme to defray the cost of switching to more energy efficient equipment. This will enhance their competitiveness, as they participate in the greening of our economy.Mr Gan and Dr Lim Wee Kiak also called for support for households to be more energy efficient. With rising number of households, more working from home and usage of appliances, increasing energy efficiency in our homes is more important than ever. Our energy labels, with the number of ticks, have enabled consumers to make informed decisions when purchasing appliances. I am heartened that more consumers are choosing appliances with higher energy efficiency. Suppliers have noticed this and are responding by expanding their offering of energy efficient appliances.We will enhance these efforts. We will add energy labels to portable air-conditioners and more types of lamps next year. The standards of air-conditioners, refrigerators, lamps and televisions will also be raised over the next two years to lock in efficiency gains and remove less efficient appliances from the market. These will help to further reduce energy consumption in our households and help consumers reduce their utility bills by choosing more energy efficient appliances. Mr Chairman, in Mandarin, please. (In Mandarin): [Please refer to Vernacular Speech.] We recognise that purchasing energy efficient appliances may involve some additional costs upfront, in order to benefit from lower utility bills in the long run. Some families may have difficulty making the payment. We introduced the Climate Friendly Households (CFH) Programme in 2020 to help households in 1- to 3-room HDB flats offset the higher cost of energy- and water-efficient household appliances.For example, last year, a family bought a 3-tick refrigerator that cost about $800. A comparable 2-tick model would cost about $200 less. With the $150 climate voucher, they could offset most of the higher cost of the 3-tick model, on top of further savings in their monthly electricity bill. We have been working with community partners to increase awareness of the Programme, through outreach activities to residents, posters at community clubs, and digital display panels at HDB blocks. We have also worked with retailers to display CFH Programme collaterals on eligible appliances for easy identification and reminder. I urge eligible households to tap on the climate vouchers to switch to more efficient appliances and fittings.We will be extending and expanding the eligibility criteria of the Climate Friendly Households Programme. This will enable more households to be eligible for the scheme, to tap on the vouchers and to benefit from bigger savings in their utility bills. More details on the programme's extension, as well as the list of eligible appliances, will be released later this year, likely to be effective in the following financial year.(In English): Aside from increasing efficiency, circularity is another avenue of being climate-friendly. Senior Minister of State Amy Khor will elaborate further on our efforts towards a zero waste nation, in particular, to reduce packaging waste and boost our recycling rate. She will also share about continued efforts to partner hawkers in ensuring Singapore's treasured hawker culture is safeguarded for years to come.Grants and policies are but tools and enablers. To unlock the next bound of the green transition, we must change our collective mindsets and behaviours. Individually, our actions may feel insignificant, but collectively, we can build a new social compact necessary for a green Singapore. The Government has been facilitating the green transition through our engagements and partnerships with the community under our Forward Singapore Steward Pillar. Prof Koh asked for an update. He will be heartened to hear that many Singaporeans share our ambitions and hopes for a greener Singapore and have great ideas to help us get there. To date, over 1,400 Singaporeans ranging from the youth to the elderly have attended close to 20 engagement sessions under the Forward Singapore Steward Pillar. The engagements focused on the challenges and trade-offs in fiscal and environmental sustainability topics, such as our net-zero ambition, resource circularity, coastal and flood resilience and food security. In a dialogue with seniors at Toa Payoh, I was particularly inspired by their ideas and enthusiasm towards recycling and reducing their carbon footprint. I remember Mr Wang, who sold his car and switched to cycling after the completion of a MRT station in his neighbourhood. He is also a handyman, repairing discarded electrical appliances regularly for his neighbours to reuse. We can certainly take a leaf out of the book of these residents in embodying the spirit of stewardship.In a bid to turn more of these ideas into action, we have launched the Green Nation Pledge. We are calling on individuals and organisations to pledge as a contributor, advocate or champion. More than 350 educational institutions and organisations representing 200,000 employees and students and more than 10,000 individuals have made Green Nation Pledges thus far.My Ministry will continue to facilitate ground-up sustainability initiatives and partner the community in building a green nation. Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey will share more on our efforts in his speech and also about our efforts on public health resilience.Mr Chairman, the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report found that the Southeast Asia region is one of the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Rising sea levels pose an existential threat to us. We are especially at risk as a low-lying island state. We also expect significant increases in temperature and extreme weather patterns by the end of the century. The impacts of climate change are far-reaching and have downstream implications on food security when harvests are affected and on water security when sources of water dry up during heatwaves. My Ministry is laying the foundation for Singapore to be a climate-ready nation. I will elaborate on how we will bolster our water security and Senior Minister of State Koh Poh Koon will share how we are shoring up our coastal defences, inland flood protection and food resilience.Singapore has four national taps – water from local catchments, imported water, NEWater and desalinated water. NEWater and desalinated water are weather-resilient sources. In addressing the threats of climate change, we will invest further in these weather-resilient taps.Ms Poh has asked for an update on our water infrastructure. We will increase the capacity and efficiency of desalination capabilities. Last year, we opened our fifth desalination plant – the Jurong Island Desalination Plant (JIDP). It is co-located with the Tembusu Multi-Utilities Complex (TMUC). This enables the plant to be about 5% more energy efficient compared to earlier desalination plants. We will strengthen our systems for managing used water and recycling it into NEWater. Used water is a precious resource that can be recycled endlessly to fortify our water resilience. We capture our used water through our Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (DTSS) – a network of deep tunnels that form a superhighway for our used water. The used water travels through the DTSS by gravity to Water Reclamation Plants (WRPs) and NEWater factories. They are then collected, treated and reclaimed to produce NEWater.When completed, the DTSS will reduce by 50% the amount of land that would otherwise have been needed for used water infrastructure. This is significant in land-scarce Singapore and will make room for more spaces for Singaporeans to live, work and play. We are making good progress on DTSS Phase 2 and expect tunnelling works to be completed by the second half of this year. This will connect the existing Changi WRP on the eastern side and the upcoming Tuas WRP in the west. The Tuas WRP will be completed by 2026, alongside the new Tuas NEWater Factory.We will be redeveloping the Kranji Water Reclamation Plant and NEWater Factory in the north as the new piece of our three-node DTSS. Preliminary design will commence this year. Together, these developments will strengthen Singapore's water reclamation system, increase the treatment capacity of used water and bolster our NEWater production.Efforts to secure our water supply must be accompanied by efforts to manage our water demand. Mr Gan asked about our efforts in improving water efficiency in the non-domestic sector. The non-domestic sector currently accounts for more than half of our total water demand and can play a big part in water conservation.We have required large water users to establish water management systems and submit annual plans for water efficiency to PUB, under the Mandatory Water Efficiency Management Practices. Through this exercise, large water users are made aware of water intensive parts of their operations and identify opportunities to increase efficiency.To further improve water efficiency in the non-domestic sector, PUB will introduce mandatory recycling requirements on new and expansion projects in industries that have high water consumption. These are namely the wafer fabrication, electronics and biomedical industries. They are water intensive and have high potential for water recycling. PUB will also enhance the incentive schemes to encourage companies to go beyond the mandatory recycling rate. This will come into effect on 1 January 2024. More details will be released later.Households can play a part through sustainable living practices and being mindful of our consumption. It is easy to take for granted that clean water is available in every household today. It is unfathomable that 60 years ago, water rationing was imposed in Singapore. The water supply had to be cut off for 12 hours, three times a week, for about eight months. We must, therefore, continue to promote water conservation among our population.A resilient water supply is critical in safeguarding our water needs from external shocks arising from climate and environmental impacts. The Singapore Water Story is one that must carry through to future generations. And that is the goal of a green nation: to steward a green, liveable and climate-resilient home. A home that is sustainable and will last for generations. The Government will lay the foundations for a green Singapore that is climate-friendly and climate-ready, but we will only make headway if this is a shared vision and if we all take collective steps along this journey.I invite businesses to partner us in being catalytic agents to the transition, by moving ahead of the curve to bring about the next bound of sustainability. I invite the community to partner us in building a social compact that will make us the greenest generation so far. I invite everyone to partner us in building a green nation together. [Applause.]Mr Chairman: Senior Minister of State Dr Amy Khor.\n"

      "Thank you, Mdm Chair. Madam, I would like to declare my interest as an employee in the aviation sector.Our aviation and maritime hubs are amongst the leading global hubs. They also generate significant carbon emissions due to the reliance on fossil fuels to power the aircraft and ships. On the bright side, Changi Airport has been consistently rated not only as one of the world’s best airports but also one of the most environmentally-friendly. It is lauded for its skylights, abundance of greenery, energy-efficient motion sensors and lighting, water-efficient fittings and roof-mounted solar panels.Singapore remains in top position as the world's busiest container transshipment port, but we may not be amongst the most sustainable ones. According to a 2020 study of 36 seaports selected from North America, Europe (EU) and Asia Pacific, EU seaports had adopted more sustainability initiatives, compared to North American and Asia Pacific seaports.What is the strategy for both sectors to support our national 2050 net-zero domestic emissions target? What are the pathway, policies and regulations that will be put in place to incentivise sustainability measures? How can research institutes, industry MNCs, financial institutes and regulatory bodies work together to co-create solutions for decarbonisation? How can existing infrastructure and assets be adapted to reduce their carbon footprint to prevent them from becoming stranded assets? And what are the strategic international framework and partnership established so far in bilateral agreements to catalyse our transition?The global aviation industry has undergone dramatic upheavals throughout the pandemic. Passenger traffic on Singapore Airlines and at Changi Airport have rebounded sharply over the past year since our borders opened in April 2022. With the Chinese borders fully opened recently, how is our aviation industry poised for further growth and how can our air hub emerge even stronger than before the pandemic, considering the uneven recovery of other global and regional air hubs? On the other hand, what are the key challenges facing the aviation industry as it rides on this wave of recovery? The airlines and airports suffered severe financial losses in the past three years. Given the strong demand, is there headroom to increase airport charges to recover the losses and to cushion against higher operating costs due to energy and manpower cost increases? The Chairman: You are out of time.\n",

      "Thank you, Mr Chairman. I would like to thank the team from MOT for answering all our questions, especially the 46 cuts from Members, which took a very efficient timeframe – one hour from 6.55 pm to 8.00 pm sharp.The responses taken by MOT Minister Iswaran, Senior Minister of State Amy Khor and Senior Minister of State Chee Hong Tat and Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey Yam Keng which took just one-and-a-half hours which, in line with what Senior Minister of State Chee Hong Tat mentioned, we, being efficient at the checkpoints, like MOT, has shown it is being efficient.At the same time, as the Senior Minister of State mentioned, I was surprised to hear that there are 300,000 trees being saved, equivalent to 300,000 trees being saved by changes in the maritime sector as well. I would like to thank the MOT team at the backend as well for their continued work to ensure a resilient, sustainable and inclusive transport system and all the Members who have spoken within that one hour last night. I hope we can continue to make sure that we continue to maintain that sustainability efforts going forward as well. Mr Chairman, with that, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.The sum of $2,550,842,700 for Head W ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates.The sum of $10,165,701,000 for Head W ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates.\n",

      "Sir, URA has concluded its long-term plan review last August with engagement from many different stakeholders – ranging from the general public to youths and industry leaders. I was delighted to be part of the engagement which started in 2021 and it was heartening to see many Singaporeans come together to think, discuss and share ideas on how they envision our future Singapore. Singapore has pockets of heritage that deserves more attention and reviving their vibrancy as we re-invent these spaces. Our heritage cannot be defined by an infrastructure marker but rather placemaking. It has to breathe life with diversity and more interactive activities throughout the day and improve infrastructure that provides ease of movement with comfort of presence under our humid weather. An example of such a place is Kampong Glam. We can consider revitalising Kampong Glam and link that as an extension of the vibrant Bugis area. To begin, we need to bring the community together including schools, merchants, hotels and community leaders to curate signature concepts that enables raising awareness of the heritage, providing education for more locals while we continue to tout these as tourist destinations. The current business mix can also be further improved to attract variety, uniqueness in concepts and having a balance of local and cosmopolitan feel. This can incentivise our locals to visit and bring synergies across different business types. Space in our tiny island always has many competing needs. While we aim to protect and conserve nature biodiversity, how can we expand our limited land space? Will using more subterranean space be a possibility for Singapore? We have done so for the Jurong Rock Cavern, MRT tunnels and common services tunnels. Are we able to move our integrated bus and MRT depots in future below ground and would the revamped Orchard Road or other streets have more underground plans as we go car-lite?  With Phase 4 of LTPR concluding, can MND provide an update on the key findings and what aspects of the public consultation feedback will feature in our land use plans? Will more of the future trends and the land use needs be included in the next Masterplan?  Singapore’s reputation has been synonymous as a “Garden City”. As part of Singapore’s Green Plan (SGP) 2030, a step further was taken to transform Singapore into a “”. Indeed, with more green spaces interwoven amongst our heartlands, it is not just aesthetically pleasing to the eye and acts as nodes for family and friends to socialise and come together. It also acts as buffers against the effects of climate change. While all greening efforts are appreciated, one challenge the citizens will have to grapple with is how they can live harmoniously with nature. We have heard of incidents of uninvited animals in the household, citizens attacked by animals when they panic and retaliate and some tree species that have been attracting unwanted birds that are creating much nuisance in the neighbourhood. As much as we want to progress the effort in giving citizens more access to greenery, we need to utilise more science and technologies to expand the ecological corridor. For example, to use heatmaps in identifying the warm spots in existing living environment to decide how to design the green spaces for natural shades that encourage human walking or socialising near their homes, and overlaying the tree varieties to review how the animal species will interact, be attracted or even migrate to the area. Ultimately, greening should not bring about inconveniences as an afterthought. Can the Minister provide an update on the progress made thus far on this aspect and if there are any areas that we can accelerate the transformation with science-based capabilities? In 2021, $25 billion has been planned for our nation’s research, innovation and enterprise development landscape, with urban solutions and sustainability being a key research domain. Could MND also shed light on how such R&D impact has on the actualisation of our urban sustainability vision? URA’s Long-Term Plan Review in 2022 saw many participants from the public express interest in having green spaces and sustainability concepts being incorporated in our future land use masterplan. What are the opportunities for the community to play a more active role in these transformation efforts? To take this beyond just community gardens that we have today, will it evolve to having ground-up planning of facilities creation with residents and better use of spaces for functional purpose that fits the local demographics, instead of just generic exercise corners or playgrounds? The Chairman: Prof Koh Lian Pin. Four cuts, please. \n",

      "Sir, NParks has made considerable efforts to engage and involve Singaporeans in the community at large in its efforts to transform Singapore into a city in nature, including allotment gardens in parks, tree planting under the One Million Trees movement and so on. What more can be done to bring even more of the community on board these efforts?Sir, Singapore aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Since buildings account for over 20% of our carbon emissions, I had asked in last year Committee of Supply about the Government's plans to accelerate our transition to a low-carbon built environment.Can MND provide further updates in this regard? Specifically, what more can be done to green our existing stock of older and less energy efficient buildings and what exciting job opportunities can Singaporeans look forward to as we continue to push for greener buildings?Sir, Singapore has unusual challenges in urban sustainability, as it is a small city-state with many competing demands.How is MND driving research and development in urban sustainability in our context and, at the same time, generating economic opportunities to export our knowledge and capabilities in urban sustainability to the world?\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, I am very thankful that during the circuit breaker in the period of April to June 2020, Singaporeans were allowed exercise at the parks; either alone or with someone you live with.Personally, it has been most beneficial to me, as I can get out for some fresh air and sunlight; and it really improved my overall well-being. I am sure this is the case for many others.Indeed, during the pandemic, having a park to go to near your home is such a blessing. We have our founding leaders to thank for being so steadfast in setting land aside for parks including nature reserves even though Singapore is so land scarce. This passion and conviction to safeguard and develop our green spaces has continued through the generations of leaders; and today Singapore is one of the greenest cities in the world. Developing and upkeeping a park comes with considerable costs. But it is worth it and necessary, particularly so for a densely populated but small island state.The pandemic has made Singaporeans even more cherished of our parks and visitorship has risen exponentially. Sir, at Bukit Panjang town, we are fortunate to have a number nature parks around us with very convenient accesses; including one nature park that is managed by Town Council. It attracted visitors from all over the island.MND launched the exciting  vision three years ago. I would like to ask how would National Parks Board (NParks) work with the community including the local agencies like Town Councils to enhance and enrich the green spaces in our neighbourhoods and towns?\n",
      "\n",
      "With the climate change crisis, there is urgency for us to go beyond the existing efforts at greening Singapore. I observe from the  (LTPR) that URA has taken pains to provide more green spaces for play and recreation. While I appreciate this as an important step, as many citizens do, too, I also believe that there are many citizens who can and wish to be more participative rather than passive consumers of green spaces. How can we create a participative or collaborative model where citizens are actively engaged in realising the “”?How can we better allocate our land for various uses to reflect and fulfil Singaporeans’ evolving aspirations and desire for more wellness and balance?The work adjustments that were forced upon us by COVID-19 present us with an opportunity to consider how much space do we really need for offices. Personnel that were not essential to be on-site worked from home, freeing up many spaces in the offices. Contrary to what many expected, many surveys point to an increase in productivity when people work from home, including one by Prodoscore, a productivity intelligence company that reports that there was an increase in productivity by 47% since March 2020, compared to the same period in the previous year in the US. In the new era and new economy, do we still need as much land for office spaces? As we rethink what growth means to include well-being, can we not allocate more land away from commercial purposes and towards regenerative and wellness purposes? I proposed the Doughnut Economics model in my Budget debate speech, and it resonated with many Singaporeans who shared how they feel hopeful and vindicated in having their sentiments shared in Parliament – their desire to have a different model of progress. Human beings are meant to live as a community and that means we share resources and responsibilities and have one another to lean on. In my previous cut, I proposed communal and co-living to foster mutual support and optimise land usage. Fostering inter-dependent relationships builds social capital and trust. Having social capital and trust and being helpful to one another increases people’s sense of self-worth and self-esteem and security. It takes away the need for material possessions to shore up our self-esteem, to acquire status symbols and helps people to feel happier with much lesser.Sociologists and anthropologists around the world know this. We can greatly reduce wasteful consumption when people have deep contentment and a sense of connectedness in their lives. In the same vein, we need to allocate more spaces in Singapore for activities that allow citizens to rebuild our relationship with Nature. Human beings are also meant to live in a symbiotic and interdependent relationships with nature. When we recognise that we are part of a larger ecosystem, interdependent on one another as well as the flora and fauna that we live amongst, we will constantly be reminded that we are one another’s keeper, making sustainable daily practices of “Using Less, Sharing More and Wasting Not”, a natural way of life. To engage our citizens constructively in action for our people’s and the planet’s wellness, I propose MND to make permaculture education a national effort. What is permaculture? It is a way of growing plants and food using nature-based regenerative methods, based on the ethics of “Earth care, People care and fair share”. It is a permanent form of agriculture which can be sustained indefinitely. It lowers the carbon footprint of food production and at the same time helps the soil used for agriculture to capture carbon from the environment. It brings and bonds different members of society together in doing so. I got to know about permaculture from Ms Catherine Loke, the Founding President of The Circle for Human Sustainability – a collective in Singapore made of architects, engineers, sociologists, scientists, design leaders and farmers. She has a visionary idea of Little Farms Everywhere for Singapore, to utilise the currently unused plots of land between our HDB blocks and in our community parks for permaculture gardens, maintained by the community, for the community.Many more Singaporeans are now showing a greater interest in growing edibles and being in nature. There is societal openness to this, and not just an esoteric interest of a fringe group of enthusiasts. We can ride on this momentum and re-introducing nature’s workers such as chickens, bees and fish within our neighbourhoods to produce local food will reduce our reliance on harmful chemicals and machinery that damages Earth.Fish in ponds help fertilise crops while eating up mosquito larvae – we do not need fogging and we do not need Wolbachia. And we can reduce dengue risk. Our young children will have ample opportunities to interact with Nature, which enhances their physical, intellectual, emotional development. If permaculture is implemented at scale, food supply chain issues would be less of an issue as it is now for Singapore, because we now import more than 90% of our food. As global fuel scarcity increases, countries will choose to prioritise their own people over exporting to us. How can we ensure our food security when that happens?There is a little-studied case of the success of Cuba. It was plunged into a severe economic and food crisis in the 1990s when the Soviet Union dissolved. But within a decade, it recovered sufficiently to double agricultural production, increase calorific availability by 25% for its people and maintain a consistent and equitable social food programme. Permaculture methods featured strongly in the reforms of Cuba at that time, and it is worth further studying to see what good practices we can adopt to ensure Singapore’s food resilience and future. I urge MND to avail more land towards regenerative nature technology research, including utilising current unused pockets of land in our HDB estates.We can work with interested Singaporeans to make permaculture part of the Singaporean way of life. There are scientists in universities, sociologists and even private groups such as Abundant Cities and even passionate individuals like The Tender Gardener Olivia Choong and Urban Jungle Folks led by Ms Michelle Tan who are already rallying Singaporeans in this effort. All MND needs to do is to allow and to support them. We can even transform the current “illegal planting” problem plaguing many HDB estates into little farms that empower and engage our seniors. Of course, this requires hard work and effort, especially in finding solutions to disamenities, like rooster crowing too early, disturbing residents. But the pros outweigh the cons. And I believe it is possible to enrol our people to co-create solutions to solve these challenges along the way. Where there is a will, there is a way.             \n",

      "Sir, MND has been actively reaching out to citizens to understand views on what the Singapore of the future should look like. Last year, the URA concluded the Long-Term Plan Review (LTPR). I would like to ask whether MND can provide an update on key findings of the LTPR and how will the feedback gathered feature in our future land use plans.Furthermore, situations may arise when building new human-centric recreational activities requires careful scrutiny and planning to avoid destroying habitats, such as proposals to clear parts of the Springleaf Forest for Nee Soon Park or to increase traffic to our Southern Islands to create tourism opportunities. In these delicate situations, what principles does the URA use to decide on development and conservation and is there a dedicated task force to coordinate the plans of different agencies to ensure that we take a science-based approach and ensure sustainable development? What are the key takeaways from the coastal and marine ecological profiling exercise carried out in tandem with the LTPR and how will these guide URA's plans moving forward? In 2020, MND announced its vision to transform Singapore into a city in nature. Under the OneMillionTrees Movement, we aim to plant a million more trees across Singapore by 2030. One day, I certainly hope that we can have one million mangrove trees or one million corals restored. Could NParks provide an update on the progress of this movement and to what extent does NParks work with partners to ensure that all tree species planted will strengthen ecological resilience and provide more habitats for native biodiversity beyond simply increasing the green cover?NParks also aims to carry out recovery plans for over 70 more animal and plant species by 2030. Could MND please provide an update on the progress of this?Given recent human wildlife interactions, including, for example, wild boars and otters, is NParks considering shifting strategies to better tackle this issue? How can knowledge better be shared with the wider community as part of everyday norms, as relocation is not a sustainable strategy for the long term in our city in nature and land-scarce Singapore.There is also a push for greening industrial estates by optimising greenery, creating forested nodes and strings of connected pocket parts being suggested. Could MND also give a progress in this regard?Finally, supported by URA, the National Heritage Board recently concluded the Kampong Glam Citizen Engagement Project. This initiative mapped and documented heritage businesses and explored ways to keep traditional trades alive. It has documented many heartwarming stories of business owners' deep connection to Kampong Glam, their pride in their craft and their steadfastness amidst changing business environments. I would like to ask what are some of the insights and observations that have been gleaned from the public and Kampong Glam stakeholders in this engagement exercise.How does URA plan to incorporate insights from this exercise into heritage conservation and placemaking efforts, particularly in terms of preserving the deep historical and cultural significance of heritage businesses?Finally, given the need to factor in cultural sensitivities and cherished traditions, what are some of the key factors that MND is weighing in this exercise and development of Kampong Glam? The Chairman: Mango trees are good, too. Ms Poh Li San. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you, Mdm Chairman. My first clarification is, indeed, firmly on wildlife. I really would appreciate more clarity on NParks' strategy and proactive approach to managing this more harmoniously in our  vision, both for the safety of humans as well as animals. Is there a step plan or framework in place to preempt hotspots or deescalate conflict, and can more thoughtful design of estates, for example, those near waterways or set in nature, such as Tengah? I appreciate public education approach, but I think we really must go beyond campaigns and only responding when there is a wildlife presence, because more animals will be pushed out into sub-optimal territory with more development.Second, on specific precincts. There have been various challenges faced by Kampong Glam stakeholders in recent times, such as rising costs and also ensuring the commercial viability of their businesses, as well as concerns whether traditional heritage in the area is being eroded by gentrification and newer developments that clash with our culture. Will place plan address these sentiments and also explore solutions to balance and address these issues?\n",
      "\n",
      "Chairman, there has been frequent feedback on birds causing a nuisance in our estates in Bishan and Toa Payoh. Since February 2022, the Town Council has received more than a thousand reports about birds.  The most recent reports are mainly of crow attacks. Other common and longstanding complaints include bird droppings on laundry, windows and ledges, and noise nuisance created by the cawing and crowing of the birds. On the other hand, there are also residents who, for reasons of biodiversity, object to actions such as tree pruning, trapping and culling, to reduce the populations of crows, mynahs and pigeons.The bird droppings cause hygiene and health concerns, affect the general aesthetics of the town and lead to higher maintenance costs. The most effective method to manage the bird population is to eliminate their shelter and food sources. In NParks' regular crow surveys, NParks would highlight areas in HDB estates with crows' nests to the Town Council for removal. Would it be more effective and efficient if NParks were to remove the nests instantly when spotted instead?  Could NParks increase the frequency of crow trapping and set more traps at different locations in the estates at the same time to increase the effectiveness of the actions? Could NParks be the implementing agency on these issues, take the lead with NEA and waste collection companies to develop more effective waste disposal measures to minimise exposed food waste for birds to feed on?  Besides public education, we also need heavier penalties for bird feeding and improper waste disposal so that the offenders will be deterred from re-offending so as to be fair to other residents who have to suffer the inconveniences brought about by their actions. Second cut. Wild, free roaming chickens have multiplied so fast at one of my estates, Thomson Sin Ming Court, that a task force comprising mainly residents, with representatives from NParks, Town Council and Acres in support, was set up to attend to the feedback from two groups of residents with opposing views. At last count, we had about 60 chickens, down from around 100 in December 2021, after a few exercises to relocate some. One group of residents have been severely affected by the loud crowing made by roosters regardless of day or night. The residents may be working from home, preparing for exams, taking a rest from shift work, or elderlies who need rest. Some have resorted to installing expensive sound-proof windows. Others send me videos or sound files as evidence of how noisy the roosters are. They are unable to rest or sleep well due to the constant disturbances. They are deeply frustrated, despite the various measures the task force has taken. These include relocating some roosters, pruning trees, placing nets over trees at hotspots, an ongoing egg hunt-and-collection and public education through walkabouts and talks by my grassroots leaders, volunteers and agencies' staff about not feeding the chickens. The other group of residents is very protective of these chickens, literally losing sleep over missing chickens. Some residents continue to feed the chickens against our advice to let them forage naturally. This has contributed to overpopulation and attracted other pests. Recently, a fight even broke out between residents due to chicken feeding and a police report was lodged.The task force strives to find a balance between having some chickens in the estate while reducing the inconveniences brought about by the overpopulation. However, the issue has continued for far too long and has incurred too much time, effort and resources and it is therefore time to step up efforts. Currently, the task force has to look for farms that are prepared to accept these chickens, build a cage of a suitable size to house them and with each farm only allowed to have ten chickens, this entire process cannot be an efficient solution to the situation.I would like to request NParks to be more proactive to relocate more of the chickens as they have done so for other constituencies.  We all know that feeding of chickens is a major contributor to the overpopulation. NParks will engage the feeders but there is no deterrence as feeding of chickens is not an offence. Would the Ministry consider including chickens in the Wildlife Act so that those caught feeding them will be deterred by the fines? The Chairman: I suspect this is the first time that chickens are featured so much in the COS. [Laughter.] Mr Louis Ng. Please take both cuts, please.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Chairman, all of us should care about biodiversity and the protection of endangered species. I propose that we enhance our efforts in tackling the illegal wildlife trade to better reflect Singapore's role as a globally important transport node.In last year's Endangered Species Act debate, the hon Member Mr Louis Ng asked if wildlife trafficking could be classified as a serious offence under the Organised Crime Act. I understand that Hong Kong has passed a Bill classifying the illegal wildlife trade under a similar law they have, the Organised and Serious Crimes Ordinance. I agree with this call and would also like to ask if the agencies tasked with tackling the illegal wildlife trade could explore coordination with their counterparts in countries identified to be key originating sources for shipments of such goods.On the local consumption front, can I check if the Ministry engages with traditional medicine practitioners to encourage them to highlight the negative impacts from consuming endangered animal products to potential consumers? This would be a good practice.Mr Chairman, residents have raised concerns following some brutal cases of animal cruelty recently. NParks receives about 1,200 complaints on average each year, of which about 20 result in warning letters, 38 in fines and six in jail. I am aware it is not easy to obtain evidence in such cases.However, in my opinion, punishments are too lax. Some members of the public have pointed out that the maximum ban of 12 months for owners is lenient and it appears that the Courts do not often impose upper limits of jail terms, which go up to three years. I call on NParks to expedite its ongoing review of these penalties.I also hope NParks will consider a complementary, restorative approach to tackling animal cruelty. This could mean requiring abusers to attend follow-ups with psychologists. NParks could also use touchpoints like pet shops and veterinary clinics to explain to owners why physical punishment and other ill-treatment like chaining, confining and not walking dogs, for example, are cruel practices. Afterall, people who mistreat animals may mistreat human beings too, one day.The Chairman: Mr Chong Kee Hiong. Take both cuts, please. \n",

      "Sir, Singapore’s Masterplan is the statutory land use plan that translates the long-term strategies of our long-term plan into detailed plans to guide developments in our land space. Singapore’ sea space is almost as large as our land space. Given the increasing demands on Singapore’s sea space, for example, for aquaculture and coastal protection measures, it may be important to also better plan for our sea space to meet our future needs. How is the Government incorporating Singapore’s sea space in our Masterplan and long-term plan? Singapore has been experiencing warming temperatures due to climate change and our densely built environment. Passive cooling strategies in newer estates may enable residents to keep cool without resorting to turning on their air-conditioners. But residents in older estates may feel the brunt of warming temperatures. Researchers from the Cooling Singapore project have also identified temperature hot spots in places, such as Geylang and Woodlands. What are the Government’s efforts to ensure that our built environment continues to be liveable for residents in all estates in the face of rising temperatures? How will the findings of the Cooling Singapore project be factored into Singapore’s land use and development plans? In 2022, the Government announced the important changes to Singapore’s Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) framework which includes enhancing the transparency of such environmental studies. However, a number of recent marine EIAs were not made available online. Instead, members of the public had to make appointments to view these reports, which can span hundreds of pages, in person during office hours. Singapore’s marine areas will face more pressures due to developments in our aquaculture sector and coastal protection measures. Easier public access to EIA reports can be helpful, for example, in soliciting public perspectives, feedback and suggestions to ensure that our aquaculture and coastal protection activities are implemented, with adequate consideration of the need to conserve our marine biodiversity. Can the Government share whether it plans to make future marine EIAs available online, perhaps with redaction of confidential portions, if necessary? How would the Government better engage with the public on these findings? As an island state with limited land, Singapore has to continuously adapt to the changing needs of our society through strategic masterplanning and the constant renewal of our built environment. Tearing down existing concrete buildings to construct new ones will, unavoidably, require cement production, which is the largest single industrial emitter of carbon dioxide, accounting for approximately 8% of global emissions based on a recent peer-reviewed scientific report. An alternative to such a clean-slate development approach is to repurpose existing infrastructure for new uses to minimise both environmental and societal impacts, such as carbon emissions and noise and air pollution. Are there inter-Ministerial strategies to optimise our masterplanning through the adaptive repurposing of our built environment? \n",
      "\n",
      "Chairman, last year, MND and URA concluded the Long-Term Plan Review. Can MND provide an update on how key findings of the review will feature in our land use plans? When can we expect the next Masterplan? What will be featured in the next Masterplan?Our land has to cater to many competing needs and demands. How can we ensure we will not sacrifice the long-term flexibility for future generations in order to meet immediate demands? Are there any key emergent trends that have changed the assumptions or objectives of our plans? For example, Singapore has set a target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. How will that affect our plans and how will that percolate down to other policies? If our plans were to help us accelerate into a low-carbon built environment, we need to consider that buildings account for over 20% of our carbon emissions. The bulk of the buildings is the existing stock of older buildings which may be less energy-efficient.  MND announced earlier that it was exploring whether to require building owners to conduct energy audits to improve the energy performance of their buildings. Can we have an update on this? Such a requirement will add on to the cost of operating buildings. How can this be done without overburdening building owners? The Chairman: Ms Nadia Samdin. Three cuts, please. \n",
      "\n",
      "Chairman, buildings account for over 20% of Singapore's carbon emissions. This is significant. With technology and advancement, new buildings today can use green material and smarter designs to reduce emissions. But in a highly built‐up environment like Singapore, we have many mature estates with high concentrations of buildings that are decades old. Many of these buildings are home to our people. I had spoken on this topic in last year's COS debate as well.  How is the Government accelerating our transition to a low‐carbon built environment? What are the quick wins and achievements so far? The use of sensors and artificial intelligence can offer predictive analytics and enable predictive maintenance, which can also identify inefficiencies and help to reduce waste of resources and energy. First, leveraging such smart technology at scale could support our journey to go green.Could the MND share more about how it is leveraging technology to do so? Also, what else is the MND doing to enhance existing buildings to be more energy efficient and reduce emissions, without having to tear down or affect homes where precious memories are forged?The Chairman: Mr Xie Yao Quan, take your cuts together. and Our Community\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you. I have two questions. One is that as we push for more flexible work arrangements, including work-from-home, I am wondering whether MND is looking at how we can enhance or redesign the living environment to better enable this, because one of the feedback is that, sometimes, there is not enough space or it is too noisy for that. Secondly, as the country continues to develop and we also talk about trying to preserve more green spaces for those who love nature, what is the Government's take on the more brownfield kind of sites? How are we going to develop or redevelop those while taking into consideration that some of these sites actually do have emotional attachments that people will have towards them like homes, like flats? I would like to get the Minister's position on this.The Chairman: Minister Desmond Lee.\n",

      "Chairman, buildings in Singapore account for over 20% of our carbon emissions, what are MND’s plan to expedite our transition to a low-carbon built environment? Certainly, more can be done to green our existing stock of older buildings, which may be less energy efficient. Can the Ministry share its initiatives and schemes to reduce the carbon footprint of our older buildings?At last year's COS, MND announced that it was exploring whether to require building owners to conduct energy audits to improve the energy performance of their buildings. What is the outcome of this review? Will the Ministry proceed to require this of owners, and if so, will there be any Government assistance to help the smaller building owners to perform the energy audits.\n",

      "Mr Chairman, over the last 58 years, we made the journey from mudflats to Metropolis. Now, coming out of a global pandemic, we are poised to embark on the next stage of our city's transformation. Building on the ideas, hopes, aspirations and dreams of Singaporeans, conveyed to us through extensive engagements, as well as based on Government planning, future Singapore will be one that is inclusive, sustainable, resilient and endearing.Planning for the future requires us to think long term. In mid-2021, MND and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) launched the Long-Term Plan Review, which mapped out our land use strategies to guide Singapore's development for the next 50 years and beyond.This included an extensive engagement with Singaporeans to hear their thoughts on these strategies, as Senior Minister of State Sim Ann mentioned in the COS 2022. Mr Cheng Hsing Yao, Miss Cheryl Chan and Ms Nadia Samdin have asked for an update on this.Since then, URA had engaged over 15,000 people from all walks of life. Through this process, we found that we sometimes have different needs and aspirations, and therefore, must make trade-offs. It is part and parcel of land use planning, given that Singapore has limited land. Our collective aspirations and potential strategies to achieve them, were featured in URA's Space for our Dreams exhibition in 2022, which was visited by close to 50,000 people, with 150,000 views on URA's website. Let me share some of the key takeaways from the public engagement and how we are translating them into long-term strategies for our future city. First, it is evident that Singaporeans take pride in our identity and heritage. While we cannot conserve each and every older building, we nevertheless want to feel that sense of familiarity and connection as we walk through our streets.Today, we already carefully consider how to safeguard our heritage as a key part of urban planning. In the last 30 years, over 7,200 heritage buildings and structures have been conserved. Beyond individual buildings, we also enhance familiar neighbourhoods and shape new places to make them memorable.We will reinforce this through Identity Corridors, where we will use urban and streetscape design to enhance the character of historic trunk roads, such as the Historic East corridor that cuts across Joo Chiat and Geylang Serai.Second, it is clear that we love nature and greenery. But, at the same time, there is both need and demand for development. Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin asked how we would balance the two.We take a science-based approach to identify ecologically important sites and prioritise them for conservation. For example, through National Parks Board (NParks)'s Ecological Profiling Exercise, we have gained a better understanding of Singapore's ecological connectivity and have identified key ecological corridors on our land and in our waters.However, given our physical constraints, we need to balance demands across a wide variety of needs, including housing, community amenities and workplaces. There may be some greenfield sites that we need to safeguard as options for development. But Singaporeans can be assured that any decision to proceed will only be made after we have carefully studied the trade-offs and alternatives in close coordination with the relevant agencies. Where necessary, we will also undertake environmental studies and formulate mitigation measures.The Government will also engage and involve stakeholders. In response to Prof Koh Lian Pin, for proposed developments that require an Environmental Impact Assessment, we seek views from academics, stakeholder groups and the public on the findings where applicable. The reports are also made publicly available online, unless there are reasons to maintain confidentiality, such as security considerations. In these cases, we will consider whether the full report can be made public and the disclosure modality, such as, for example, making it available for hard copy viewing. And we do recognise that some may face difficulties accessing hardcopy reports. Where possible, we will provide accommodations, such as by extending the duration of the public feedback period. All feedback is carefully considered and incorporated into the final report and our plans where relevant.Third, some participants shared concerns on how Singapore will adapt to the increasingly complex and ambiguous global environment, something which Mr Cheng Hsing Yao also spoke about. To cater for the uncertainties of the future, we continuously monitor trends, such as an ageing population, to evolving geopolitical tensions, and shifts in the global economic outlook. This enables us to consider a range of possibilities and plan ahead to enhance our resilience.Ms Carrie Tan suggested we review the allocation of land to various uses, such as residential and commercial, to factor in evolving trends, such as changes to live-work patterns.Indeed, this is something we currently do and will continue to do. For example, in developing plans for areas, such as the Greater Southern Waterfront, we intentionally keep our plans flexible and pace out their development. This is so that we can adjust the mix of uses to respond to changing trends and needs.The Long-Term Plan Review, as the name indicates, sets out our goals in the long-term, that is, to say, a 50-year timeframe or so. However, in order to get there, we will have to start giving effect to these strategies and plans over the next 10 to 15 years. This exercise is known as the Masterplan Review and it will provide detailed land use and development plans covering sites all over Singapore, from major transformation areas, such as the Greater Southern Waterfront and Paya Lebar Airbase, to residential towns, neighbourhoods and our heartlands.The Masterplan presents an opportunity to plan ways to improve our living environment together. As highlighted by Ms Nadia Samdin, we will provide various avenues to engage Singaporeans of all ages and from all walks of life, to share their views on our national and local plans. This will be done over the next two to three years. In response to Mr Cheng Hsing Yao and Miss Cheryl Chan, URA is currently working on the key ideas, but allow me share some of the strategies that the Masterplan will be built upon.First, the Masterplan will be centred on liveable towns. As we plan for a new generation of towns, such as the ones that Paya Lebar Airbase will make way for and rejuvenate our older ones, we will pay close attention to making them more liveable for everyone.Ms Poh Li San asked about plans to spread out amenities to better serve residential estates across Singapore. It remains our priority to make every housing estate a desirable place to live in. We will continue to ensure that our estates are planned with a range of housing options, served by a wide variety of amenities that meet our residents' needs and preferences and are highly accessible.Second, the Masterplan will work within our land and resource constraints, a necessity for a small city like Singapore. One way is to recycle our brownfield sites. There are also ongoing efforts to increase and optimise our underground space, as highlighted by Miss Cheryl Chan. Where possible, we place infrastructure, such as transport, utilities and storage spaces underground to free up aboveground space for housing, recreational spaces and other people-centric uses.We will also repurpose existing buildings, as Prof Koh Lian Pin highlighted.Today, we have incentives to encourage adaptive reuse. State properties are put to various uses, from residential to lifestyle. During COVID-19, many were activated as quarantine facilities. There are also incentives for owners who renovate their conserved buildings to meet modern uses while enhancing the building character, such as additional floor area and tax concessions. However, there will still be situations where redevelopment is needed.In such cases, we have incentives to minimise emissions, such as BCA's Green Mark certification scheme that recognises redevelopment projects that conserve existing structures and reuse or recycle demolished materials.Several Members also suggested repurposing under-utilised spaces for new uses. Assoc Prof Jamus Lim asked if the lowest floor of multi-storey car parks can be repurposed for bicycle parking, echoing a similar call made earlier by Mr Edward Chia in November 2022.For some public housing developments, bicycle parking is provided at the void deck for our residents' convenience. To optimise space at void decks, HDB also plans to install 40,000 dual bicycle racks, which can each hold two bicycles in 23 existing HDB towns by 2025.Multi-storey carparks with under-utilised space are currently used for various activities. One example is urban farming. We do not generally co-locate bicycle parking in car parks as this could pose safety issues to cyclists, especially where cars and bicycles have to use the same lanes. However, if a request is made by any precinct for this, HDB will consider on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration other competing uses for the carparks and whether the safety concerns and any other relevant considerations can be adequately addressed.Ms Jessica Tan, Ms Carrie Tan, Miss Cheryl Chan and Mr Liang Eng Hwa suggested partnering the community to co-create shared spaces, such as permaculture plots or pilots.Today, there are opportunities for Singaporeans to co-create community projects, leveraging URA's and HDB's Lively Places Programme. Many projects are in under-utilised spaces, including a void deck garden in Bishan.NParks' initiatives' such as Friends of the Parks and the Community in Bloom movement also encourage the local community to play a part in designing, developing and managing green spaces, while HDB and SFA's urban farms at 14 multi-storey car park rooftops contribute to food security.For permaculture farms to meaningfully enhance food security, they should be done on a commercial scale. Given the sizeable amount of land required, it is more practical to encourage community gardeners to adopt permaculture principles. Nevertheless, Town Councils have the autonomy to determine how common property can be utilised, subject to our laws and HDB's consent. We are happy to consider proposals that enhance food security and sustainability, where appropriate.As Prof Koh Lian Pin highlighted, there are diverse and competing needs for our sea space as well. We carefully plan our sea space to meet Singapore's needs.Today, most sea space within our port limits are used by the maritime and port industry. We also set aside space for other uses, including marine biodiversity conservation, aquaculture, utilities and recreation. For instance, we have safeguarded Marine Nature Areas and Marine Parks at our Southern Islands in URA's Parks and Waterbodies Plan. To optimise our sea space, we will continue working with relevant stakeholders to explore co-locating synergistic uses, such as siting of solar panels together with fish farms along the East Johor Straits. These ideas, plans and strategies will eventually culminate in URA's presentation of their next draft Masterplan, which will be open for public feedback. I strongly encourage all Singaporeans to participate and share your views.Next, let me zoom in one level deeper and speak about our plans to rejuvenate HDB estates, which are a big part of our residents' day-to-day lived experiences. As our nation gets older, so do our towns. But this does not mean that they cannot continue to be vibrant and liveable. In response to Ms Poh Li San, HDB crowdsources ideas from residents to renew and rejuvenate existing HDB towns and estates under the Remaking Our Heartland programme. This spans from upgrading our town and Neighbourhood Centres to opening new community spaces and parks.Ms Joan Pereira and Mr Ang Wei Neng asked about plans to maintain and upgrade older flats. I would like to assure Singaporeans that we are committed to giving due priority to rejuvenating our estates, for the safety and comfort of our residents. All flats above 30 years would have already undergone the Main Upgrading Programme (MUP) in the past or will be selected for the  by 2030 subject to the Government's fiscal position. The next round of upgrading for these flats would be around 60 to 70 years of age. In between, we provide support to flat owners for in-flat maintenance issues, such as repairing ceiling leaks under the Goodwill Repair Assistance.Besides upgrading, redevelopment is another way to rejuvenate older areas. On Ms Joan Pereira's question about the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme, or SERS, we shared that most projects with high redevelopment potential have already been selected for SERS and we do not expect many more sites to be eligible. As Minister Desmond has mentioned earlier, we are also working on our plans for the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme, or VERS. More households will be able to benefit from redevelopment before their leases expire and we can renew our towns progressively and create a refreshed living environment with new homes and updated amenities for residents. We will share more details with Singaporeans when ready.Several Members also asked about HIP's drying racks. The external retractable clothes drying rack that Mr Ang Wei Neng spoke about is designed to maximise laundry capacity while ensuring user safety. Each of the six poles in the rack measures up to 1.7 metres in usable length, to accommodate large items like bedsheets. HDB will continue ways to look for ways to increase the rack's laundry capacity.On Mr Muhamad Faisal Abdul Manap's suggestion to extend the installation of HIP's laundry hanging rack to flats which do not qualify for the programme, we can consider this when there is sufficient demand.Allow me to respond to Mr Ang Wei Neng and Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong's cuts on lift upgrading. As of January 2023, there are only about 140 HDB blocks with units without direct access to lifts on the same floor. This is due to technical and site constraints or high costs, some of which exceed $100,000 per unit. HDB continues to explore technical methods, though these are still nascent. We will also continue to review requests for lift upgrading, bearing in mind costs, space constraints and technical feasibility.Mr Dennis Tan has asked about the Lift access Housing Grant (LHG) which provides up to $30,000 to help residents buy another flat with lift access. A key condition for this grant is that residents need direct lift access due to medical or mobility issues. Of those who have applied, the approval rate is high, at close to 90%. As our residents aged, we do expect take-up to increase as they face medical or mobility conditions.Flat owners who have bought another flat with the grants can sell their existing flat on the open market. Hence, there is no need for HDB to buy them back. If they have difficulties selling the existing flat, HDB can grant a time extension on a case-by-case basis. HDB will continue to monitor the situation and assess if further enhancements to the grant are necessary.Prof Koh Lian Pin asked about our efforts to keep older estates cool as temperatures rise and how we will use the findings from Cooling Singapore 2.0.  HDB has several initiatives under the Green Towns Programme to reduce ambient temperatures, such as: Introducing greenery to the top decks of selected multi-storey car parks in the form of urban farms, community gardens or rooftop greenery.There is also an ongoing pilot on cool paint.Where possible, such as for newer towns like Tengah, we adopt new technologies such as the Centralised Cooling System, which provides a more energy-efficient cooling solution than conventional air-conditioning systems.We will continue to invest in R&D to deepen our knowledge on urban heat. This includes Cooling Singapore 2.0, an ongoing project where a digital model simulating our urban climate will help us understand the impact of urban heat locally and assess heat mitigation strategies. Mr Chong Kee Hiong spoke about the need to educate residents on fire safety and provide safety features in HDB flats and estates.Since 2018, SCDF’s Fire Code requires every new flat and existing flat undergoing major renovation to install fire alarms. As optional improvements under HIP, HDB also offers installations of a Home Fire Alarm Device. HDB and SCDF are further embarking on a trial to place and maintain one fire extinguisher at a lift lobby of every two HDB blocks.Out of the 934 cases of residential fire last year, 783 took place in HDB flats, which reflects the proportion of public housing in Singapore. Today, SCDF conducts public education campaigns, including door-to-door engagements with residents and educating new homeowners on fire safety together with HDB. Currently, all flat owners who are taking or have an existing HDB loan to buy their flats are required to be covered under basic fire insurance. An HDB-appointed company provides basic coverage and the premiums payable by flat owners range between $1.63 and $8.18 only, for a five-year coverage.Let me now touch on another important priority for us – transforming Singapore into a . This vision is a key pillar of the Singapore Green Plan 2030. It underscores our strong desire to conserve and extend our natural capital – for the benefit of the environment and for the benefit of our people. Miss Cheryl Chan asked for updates on our progress on this front.First, we have continued to establish new green spaces and to enhance existing ones.For instance, last November, we opened the Rifle Range Nature Park. It serves as an ecological buffer to protect the rich biodiversity in the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and creates more opportunities for families to enjoy nature-based recreation.Between now and 2030, we have six more nature parks in the pipeline that Singaporeans can look forward to. This includes the Lim Chu Kang Nature Park, which we will be opening later this year. It will feature a variety of natural habitats such as mangroves, woodlands and grasslands, as well as a restored colonial-era bungalow for those who lover heritage. Singaporeans can also soon enjoy the northern section of the Lakeside Garden in Jurong Lake Gardens. It will offer a youth park with skating facilities and panoramic views across Jurong Lake. We are also enhancing our existing green spaces to make them more inclusive. For example, we currently have 10 Therapeutic Gardens, which are specially designed to improve the physical and mental well-being of people across a diverse range of physical abilities and health conditions. This includes three that we launched over the past year, and we will add 20 more by 2030. Second, we are pressing on with efforts to restore nature into our urban landscape.Today, we have around 155 hectares of skyrise greenery, equivalent to almost 220 football fields. We are on track to meet our target of 200 hectares by 2030.Ms Nadia Samdin asked about our efforts to green industrial estates. Since 2020, we have more than doubled the number of trees in our industrial estates, from 90,000 to 180,000 today. By 2030, these estates will have around 260,000 trees. These will cool the environment and beautify the area for the people who work there.Third, we are strengthening the connectivity between green spaces. For example, we opened the northern stretch of the Rail Corridor last month, completing over 21 kilometres of green, continuous north-south connectivity. In total, we have completed over 180 kilometres of Nature Ways and 375 kilometres of park connectors, putting us on track to achieve our goal for all households to be within a 10-minute walk from a park by 2030. This increases Singaporeans’ access to nature and strengthens our ecosystems’ resilience, by facilitating the movement of biodiversity between habitats.This brings me to our efforts to conserve our native plant and animal species, which Ms Nadia Samdin asked about.We have crossed the three-quarter mark of our 2030 species recovery target, with 82 plant and 42 animal species covered today. This includes the endemic Singapore Ginger and the Singapore Freshwater Crab. We have also restored and enhanced over 30 hectares of forest, coastal, and marine habitats, well ahead of our target to do so by 2030. This was made possible through the contributions of our volunteers, who help with planting native trees and shrubs, and removing invasive species.To provide more conducive habitats for our native biodiversity to thrive, we will raise our ambitions on this front. We now aim to restore 80 hectares of forest, coastal, and marine habitats by 2030, by intensifying the planting of native species and encouraging the establishment of native animal populations. As we push on with our greening efforts, Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Mr Xie Yao Quan have asked how we can involve even more members of the community. This year marks 60 years since then-Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew kickstarted our greening journey by launching our first nation-wide tree-planting campaign in 1963. Under the OneMillionTrees movement, we have partnered more than 75,000 members of the community to plant over 500,000 trees since 2020.We have planted native rainforest species in our forests to strengthen the ecological resilience of these habitats, so that they can better support our native biodiversity.The planted trees also help to intensify greenery and strengthen ecological connectivity along our streetscapes, Nature Ways and park connectors.To commemorate this milestone year, we will create more tree-planting opportunities under the OneMillionTrees movement and we hope that you will join us in celebrating this milestone.We will also continue to engage Singaporeans on the conservation and celebration of our natural heritage.Through our  Conversations, we were inspired by members of the community who shared and worked on ideas to encourage more residents to participate in our efforts.This included ideas for community stewards to organise nature-based activities, such as biodiversity surveys, and to curate educational resources on the benefits of  through experiential learning.We will continue to grow our base of over 60,000 volunteers and over 11,000 citizen scientists.We will reach out to more youths through platforms such as our Youth Stewards for Nature programme, to nurture future volunteers and stewards of our natural heritage.Mr Xie Yao Quan and Miss Cheryl Chan have also asked about our research and development (R&D) efforts in urban sustainability. We are collaborating closely with industry and academic partners to support our key initiatives under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, including our  ambitions. Under the Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 Plan, we have set aside close to $270 million for research to address new challenges in areas such as climate change. One of the research programmes funded under RIE 2025 is the Marine Climate Change Science programme, for which we have started to award grants. One looks at developing ecological and microbial solutions to enhance the resilience of coral reefs to climate change. Another looks at building up the foundational science for blue carbon accounting in Singapore.We also recently launched the first grant call under the  research vertical of the Cities of Tomorrow programme. These research projects will help us deepen our scientific foundations and develop evidence-based management practices. So, I look forward to active participation in our grant call. The years ahead are going to be very exciting ones as we shape our future city together.The MND family looks forward to working with all Singaporeans on this transformation journey and to making Singapore a place we are proud to call home. [Applause.]The Chairman: Senior Minister of State Sim Ann.\n",

      "Madam, to answer Ms Nadia's supplementary question, through the place plan, we have been working very closely with the stakeholders there to identify projects as well to look at strategies to ensure that the precinct continues to thrive. We also see how we can garner effective partnerships and also harness the resources needed. One thing about Kampong Glam is that there is this notion of cultural and historical value in that area. What we have been doing is we have been working very closely with the businesses there, the investors as well as the community, to see how to find ways to protect Kampong Glam's historical uniqueness.While doing that, we also are studying the case studies from around the world to see how some of these cities have been able to protect and continue to make their historical and heritage areas thrive. What is key is that I am very heartened that we have got more than 1,600 people coming onboard to share their views. This in itself allow us to work very closely with the community. In fact, even during COVID-19, we worked very closely with the Kampong Glam's community and the people who used live there.So, I am quite happy with the support but now, it is about how we want to navigate together with the community and the stakeholders there to develop and deliver the plan.The Chairman: Mr Leong Mun Wai.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mdm Chairman, may I just address the second clarification which Ms Tin Pei Ling put forward?She has identified something where we need to maintain a balance. We have got green spaces. There are brownfield sites. At the same time, there is heritage. And in the early days, where it was largely just greenfield, it was not an issue. You just expanded into the green spaces. But now, we find that that is becoming increasingly scarce and we have to try and make sure that we preserve green spaces. But at the same time, there is a need for development. So, we have got to balance the two.But brownfield sites are actually quite exciting. They are exciting because it gives you an opportunity to redevelop and build on something which exists. And the big thing now for anybody who is in the infrastructure space is how do you take something which is an existing building and make it sustainable. And there are a lot of technologies and solutions that are going into this so that you actually turn something which is brown green again. Then, you may also have to tear down something which is existing and build afresh on it, redevelop it. And when you do that, that is when I think some of us, depending on the building, its location and what it was associated with, then you may lose some of the heritage and that cultural association. So, we have to have a good balance and we assess the buildings and the site. And if there is a heritage value, then we have to see whether you preserve the whole thing or whether you might have to redevelop it but you preserve some parts of it, for example, the old Police Academy where we are going to have residential buildings. But we did not want to raze it completely. So, we consulted, we got public feedback. We also spoke to the old Police officers who had gone through the Police Academy. And there will be a part of it which will be retained there.And if you look at the URA long-term plan review, there was a segment which was the Paya Lebar Air Base, we can see how, this is still at the concept stage, but they tried very hard to make sure that parts of the runway would still be there so as to preserve that association.So, if I had to sum it up, I would say that our approach is really heart, home and heritage.The Chairman: Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.\n",
      "\n",
      "I see, okay. I will just cite one example, in the interest of time. It is under the Built Environment Technology Alliance, or BETA, programme. Woh Hup Group and Alliance Concrete Singapore Pte Ltd, in collaboration with the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), have developed a manufacturing process for low-carbon concrete.This is one of the few in the world that we are trying out, and if successful, this technology could help position companies, like those participating in this project, to better secure overseas construction projects, especially at the time where sustainability and green considerations are at the top of many buyers' minds around the world and our region.The Chairman: We are running out of clarification time. So, I am going to take four more clarifications. On both sides, can I ask that answers be also kept succinct. Let me read out the order, so you can all put your hands down, I have seen everybody's hands: Mr Gerald Giam, Ms Nadia Samdin, Mr Leong Mun Wai and we will end with Leader of the Opposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mdm Chairman, I will keep it brief. The short answer to the Member's suggestions is yes, we certainly will explore all the different ways in which you can better manage the human-wildlife conflicts, including being more proactive about looking at the habitats of the wildlife and at the specific areas where there are food sources, and how we can make sure we minimise the food source available to them, so that they can stop foraging at the human-inhabited areas.One important component is how we work with the community. We have seen good successes where we have worked with community groups. For example, I mentioned the Urban Wildlife Group and the Otters Working Group, where we proactively engaged the residents ahead of time, for example, to prepare their facilities better to prevent otters from coming into their homes or minimise the risk or the threat that the otters feel when the young pups are in the habitat.So, there are many ways we are doing so, and we will continue to do so. We welcome suggestions as we do.The Chairman: Minister of State Faishal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Chairman, before I address the cuts filed by Members, I would like to thank many Members who spoke on sustainability during the Budget debate. In particular, Prof Koh Lian Pin's call for climate change and sustainability to always be among the bread-and-butter issues we focus on. And Ms Carrie Tan's motto to Share More, Use Less, Waste Not, resonated with me. Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean also spoke about our raised climate ambition and the urgent need for climate action. He explained that a whole-of-nation effort was needed to transition to a greener future. This nationwide effort is underpinned by the Singapore Green Plan 2030, which we launched two years ago. The Green Plan charts bold and concrete policies and actions for Singapore to achieve our net-zero emissions goal. It serves as a critical compass on our path to sustainability. My colleagues from other Ministries have been or will be providing updates on their green plan initiatives over the Committee of Supply (COS) debate.We must press on with this intergenerational effort to steward a green, liveable and climate-resilient home for Singaporeans and our future generations. Today, my colleagues from the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) and I will share how we are laying the foundations for a green nation that is Climate-Resilient and Climate-Friendly. First, I will elaborate on how we are leading, enabling and facilitating Singapore's transition to a climate-friendly nation. The public sector will lead the way for Singapore's decarbonisation journey and pave the way for green efforts to take root. Under the GreenGov.SG initiative, the public sector has committed to achieving net-zero emissions around 2045, five years ahead of our national target. Prof Koh Lian Pin and Mr Don Wee asked for a progress update.To spearhead the effort, we have appointed Singapore's first Government Chief Sustainability Officer (GCSO). Each Ministry has also appointed a Chief Sustainability Officer to oversee sustainability matters across their Ministry family. They will work closely with the GCSO to develop and coordinate strategies to meet this ambition.Our public sector agencies are pushing ahead with decarbonising their systems and processes. For instance, the National Environment Agency (NEA) is working with Keppel Seghers on a joint feasibility study to capture carbon dioxide emitted from Waste-to-Energy plants. Ms Poh Li San asked about PUB's decarbonisation plans and solutions. PUB has also committed to achieve net-zero emissions around 2045, in line with our GreenGov.SG ambition. Their decarbonisation strategy is underpinned by 3Rs – Reduce, Replace and Remove. First, PUB will reduce carbon emissions by improving the efficiency of energy-intensive processes such as desalination and NEWater. It targets to reduce the energy consumption for desalination from 3.5 to less than 2 kilowatt-hour per cubic meter by 2025. PUB's upcoming Tuas Water Reclamation Plant (WRP) will be fully energy self-sufficient by harnessing synergies with NEA's Integrated Waste Management Facility.Next, PUB will also replace carbon-based energy sources with renewable energy, including solar. We are already home to one of the world's largest floating solar farms at Tengeh Reservoir. We are deploying the next floating solar farms at Pandan Reservoir and plan to call the tender for this later this year.PUB is also exploring innovative technologies to remove carbon. In partnership with the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), PUB is test-bedding the use of novel electrolysis technology to capture carbon dioxide in seawater as part of the desalination process. This will produce hydrogen and pre-treated seawater so that it can be desalinated at lower energy. Mr Don Wee and Miss Cheryl Chan will be pleased to hear that from this financial year onwards, the Government will publish an annual GreenGov.SG report, the report will show our efforts, progress and plans. We will start with reporting Scope 1 and 2 emissions, electricity and water consumption with reference to international standards and frameworks.From FY2024, all Statutory Boards will also make their annual environmental sustainability disclosures. Several statutory boards have started making sustainability disclosures. They have been systematically incorporating sustainability in their decision-making and risk management frameworks to achieve concrete sustainability outcomes. As Mr Don Wee, Mr Louis Ng and Prof Koh pointed out, the public sector can drive the nation's transition to a green economy by leveraging on its procurement budget. Let me elaborate on our plans for green procurement in the public sector.The public sector has adopted green procurement since 2007. Thus far, we have introduced sustainability requirements for selected goods and services. For example, Information and Communications Technology (ICT) equipment, electrical appliances and printing paper must first meet environmental standards before they are assessed on price and quality attributes. Building on this foundation, we intend to raise the bar. Starting from 2024, besides pre-qualifying the products on environmental standards, we will also consider the sustainability practices of the company we buy from. As announced by Senior Minister of State for Finance, Mr Chee Hong Tat, we will start with large construction and ICT tenders. These make up more than 60% of the value of Government procurement contracts. Such projects include public infrastructure, industrial buildings and office ICT equipment contracts.Using ICT as an example, in addition to the requirement of matching the best-in-class in energy efficiency, we may evaluate the efforts of the tenderers in reducing packaging and carbon footprint of their operations, when we evaluate the tender bids. As this is a new concept, we will start with setting aside up to 5% of the evaluation points for environmental sustainability. We will review the amount and engage industry closely as we expand the adoption of sustainability criteria to more public sector procurement sectors. Mr Don Wee asked if such efforts to green the public sector will entail additional costs. Environmental sustainability is not costless and we will have to pay a bit more for greener goods and services. But as the world decarbonises, the demand for green products and services will grow.And green procurement in the public sector will encourage suppliers to adopt sustainability practices and develop green products and services. Thereby, enhancing the growth of the green economy in Singapore and the competitiveness of our companies globally. The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) had outlined initiatives that support businesses in adopting sustainability practices, such as measuring carbon emissions sustainability reporting and seizing opportunities in the green economy. I hope that these initiatives under GreenGov.SG will spur many in the private sector to follow suit, in publishing their own sustainability reports and incorporating sustainability considerations in their procurement policies. Together as a nation, we can transform our economy.  This leads me to talk about enabling the transformation through partnering businesses and the community. Building a green nation requires the participation of all – businesses, communities and persons. The Government cannot do it alone and all of us must work closely alongside each other, as partners, to deliver on the Green Plan.We will be raising our carbon tax progressively over the next few years to further incentivise carbon and energy efficiency throughout the economy and society. The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) had addressed queries on allowances under the transition framework that Miss Cheryl Chan asked about. As raised by Prof Koh, we will allow companies to use high-quality international carbon credits or ICCs, to offset up to 5% of their taxable emissions. We will publish a whitelist of acceptable ICCs later this year, which will include eligible host countries, carbon crediting programmes and methodologies. Businesses should do more with less. Creating more products and services with less resources and less waste will raise their competitiveness in the long run, particularly against higher carbon and energy prices. Businesses must invest in energy efficient equipment or manufacturing processes. Some upfront costs may be incurred. However, over the long run, lower energy and resource use will lead to lower costs over the equipment's lifecycle. Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked about the support provided for businesses, including SMEs, in making this upfront investment. We recognise that upfront capital investment can be challenging for our businesses, particularly SMEs. To support an inclusive transition, we will help SMEs make the switch. Enterprise Singapore introduced the Energy Efficiency Grant (EEG) for food services, food manufacturing and retail sectors last year. NEA also enhanced the Energy Efficiency Fund (E2F) for manufacturing companies to invest in energy efficient equipment. One SME that benefited from the enhanced E2F is ACP Metal Finishing Private Limited (ACP), which specialises in metal surface treatments and finishes. ACP tapped on the enhanced E2F to replace over a thousand fluorescent lightings in its facilities with more energy efficient LED lightings. The E2F funded 70% of the $60,000 project cost. With these retrofits, the company improved the energy efficiency of its operations. They enjoyed annual energy savings of about $30,000 which represents a payback period of less than a year with support from the E2F.I am happy to announce that we will further enhance the Energy Efficiency Fund to provide manufacturing companies with certainty of the grant amount, upfront, when they invest in energy efficient equipment. We will also further simplify the grant application process by streamlining the measurement and verification requirements. I encourage eligible companies, particularly our SMEs to tap the enhanced scheme to defray the cost of switching to more energy efficient equipment. This will enhance their competitiveness, as they participate in the greening of our economy.Mr Gan and Dr Lim Wee Kiak also called for support for households to be more energy efficient. With rising number of households, more working from home and usage of appliances, increasing energy efficiency in our homes is more important than ever. Our energy labels, with the number of ticks, have enabled consumers to make informed decisions when purchasing appliances. I am heartened that more consumers are choosing appliances with higher energy efficiency. Suppliers have noticed this and are responding by expanding their offering of energy efficient appliances.We will enhance these efforts. We will add energy labels to portable air-conditioners and more types of lamps next year. The standards of air-conditioners, refrigerators, lamps and televisions will also be raised over the next two years to lock in efficiency gains and remove less efficient appliances from the market. These will help to further reduce energy consumption in our households and help consumers reduce their utility bills by choosing more energy efficient appliances. Mr Chairman, in Mandarin, please. (In Mandarin): [Please refer to Vernacular Speech.] We recognise that purchasing energy efficient appliances may involve some additional costs upfront, in order to benefit from lower utility bills in the long run. Some families may have difficulty making the payment. We introduced the Climate Friendly Households (CFH) Programme in 2020 to help households in 1- to 3-room HDB flats offset the higher cost of energy- and water-efficient household appliances.For example, last year, a family bought a 3-tick refrigerator that cost about $800. A comparable 2-tick model would cost about $200 less. With the $150 climate voucher, they could offset most of the higher cost of the 3-tick model, on top of further savings in their monthly electricity bill. We have been working with community partners to increase awareness of the Programme, through outreach activities to residents, posters at community clubs, and digital display panels at HDB blocks. We have also worked with retailers to display CFH Programme collaterals on eligible appliances for easy identification and reminder. I urge eligible households to tap on the climate vouchers to switch to more efficient appliances and fittings.We will be extending and expanding the eligibility criteria of the Climate Friendly Households Programme. This will enable more households to be eligible for the scheme, to tap on the vouchers and to benefit from bigger savings in their utility bills. More details on the programme's extension, as well as the list of eligible appliances, will be released later this year, likely to be effective in the following financial year.(In English): Aside from increasing efficiency, circularity is another avenue of being climate-friendly. Senior Minister of State Amy Khor will elaborate further on our efforts towards a zero waste nation, in particular, to reduce packaging waste and boost our recycling rate. She will also share about continued efforts to partner hawkers in ensuring Singapore's treasured hawker culture is safeguarded for years to come.Grants and policies are but tools and enablers. To unlock the next bound of the green transition, we must change our collective mindsets and behaviours. Individually, our actions may feel insignificant, but collectively, we can build a new social compact necessary for a green Singapore. The Government has been facilitating the green transition through our engagements and partnerships with the community under our Forward Singapore Steward Pillar. Prof Koh asked for an update. He will be heartened to hear that many Singaporeans share our ambitions and hopes for a greener Singapore and have great ideas to help us get there. To date, over 1,400 Singaporeans ranging from the youth to the elderly have attended close to 20 engagement sessions under the Forward Singapore Steward Pillar. The engagements focused on the challenges and trade-offs in fiscal and environmental sustainability topics, such as our net-zero ambition, resource circularity, coastal and flood resilience and food security. In a dialogue with seniors at Toa Payoh, I was particularly inspired by their ideas and enthusiasm towards recycling and reducing their carbon footprint. I remember Mr Wang, who sold his car and switched to cycling after the completion of a MRT station in his neighbourhood. He is also a handyman, repairing discarded electrical appliances regularly for his neighbours to reuse. We can certainly take a leaf out of the book of these residents in embodying the spirit of stewardship.In a bid to turn more of these ideas into action, we have launched the Green Nation Pledge. We are calling on individuals and organisations to pledge as a contributor, advocate or champion. More than 350 educational institutions and organisations representing 200,000 employees and students and more than 10,000 individuals have made Green Nation Pledges thus far.My Ministry will continue to facilitate ground-up sustainability initiatives and partner the community in building a green nation. Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey will share more on our efforts in his speech and also about our efforts on public health resilience.Mr Chairman, the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report found that the Southeast Asia region is one of the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Rising sea levels pose an existential threat to us. We are especially at risk as a low-lying island state. We also expect significant increases in temperature and extreme weather patterns by the end of the century. The impacts of climate change are far-reaching and have downstream implications on food security when harvests are affected and on water security when sources of water dry up during heatwaves. My Ministry is laying the foundation for Singapore to be a climate-ready nation. I will elaborate on how we will bolster our water security and Senior Minister of State Koh Poh Koon will share how we are shoring up our coastal defences, inland flood protection and food resilience.Singapore has four national taps – water from local catchments, imported water, NEWater and desalinated water. NEWater and desalinated water are weather-resilient sources. In addressing the threats of climate change, we will invest further in these weather-resilient taps.Ms Poh has asked for an update on our water infrastructure. We will increase the capacity and efficiency of desalination capabilities. Last year, we opened our fifth desalination plant – the Jurong Island Desalination Plant (JIDP). It is co-located with the Tembusu Multi-Utilities Complex (TMUC). This enables the plant to be about 5% more energy efficient compared to earlier desalination plants. We will strengthen our systems for managing used water and recycling it into NEWater. Used water is a precious resource that can be recycled endlessly to fortify our water resilience. We capture our used water through our Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (DTSS) – a network of deep tunnels that form a superhighway for our used water. The used water travels through the DTSS by gravity to Water Reclamation Plants (WRPs) and NEWater factories. They are then collected, treated and reclaimed to produce NEWater.When completed, the DTSS will reduce by 50% the amount of land that would otherwise have been needed for used water infrastructure. This is significant in land-scarce Singapore and will make room for more spaces for Singaporeans to live, work and play. We are making good progress on DTSS Phase 2 and expect tunnelling works to be completed by the second half of this year. This will connect the existing Changi WRP on the eastern side and the upcoming Tuas WRP in the west. The Tuas WRP will be completed by 2026, alongside the new Tuas NEWater Factory.We will be redeveloping the Kranji Water Reclamation Plant and NEWater Factory in the north as the new piece of our three-node DTSS. Preliminary design will commence this year. Together, these developments will strengthen Singapore's water reclamation system, increase the treatment capacity of used water and bolster our NEWater production.Efforts to secure our water supply must be accompanied by efforts to manage our water demand. Mr Gan asked about our efforts in improving water efficiency in the non-domestic sector. The non-domestic sector currently accounts for more than half of our total water demand and can play a big part in water conservation.We have required large water users to establish water management systems and submit annual plans for water efficiency to PUB, under the Mandatory Water Efficiency Management Practices. Through this exercise, large water users are made aware of water intensive parts of their operations and identify opportunities to increase efficiency.To further improve water efficiency in the non-domestic sector, PUB will introduce mandatory recycling requirements on new and expansion projects in industries that have high water consumption. These are namely the wafer fabrication, electronics and biomedical industries. They are water intensive and have high potential for water recycling. PUB will also enhance the incentive schemes to encourage companies to go beyond the mandatory recycling rate. This will come into effect on 1 January 2024. More details will be released later.Households can play a part through sustainable living practices and being mindful of our consumption. It is easy to take for granted that clean water is available in every household today. It is unfathomable that 60 years ago, water rationing was imposed in Singapore. The water supply had to be cut off for 12 hours, three times a week, for about eight months. We must, therefore, continue to promote water conservation among our population.A resilient water supply is critical in safeguarding our water needs from external shocks arising from climate and environmental impacts. The Singapore Water Story is one that must carry through to future generations. And that is the goal of a green nation: to steward a green, liveable and climate-resilient home. A home that is sustainable and will last for generations. The Government will lay the foundations for a green Singapore that is climate-friendly and climate-ready, but we will only make headway if this is a shared vision and if we all take collective steps along this journey.I invite businesses to partner us in being catalytic agents to the transition, by moving ahead of the curve to bring about the next bound of sustainability. I invite the community to partner us in building a social compact that will make us the greenest generation so far. I invite everyone to partner us in building a green nation together. [Applause.]Mr Chairman: Senior Minister of State Dr Amy Khor.\n",

      "Chairman, let me now elaborate on our vision for a zero-waste nation and my pet topic – no, not smoking, but hawkers and hawker centres.Since the launch of the Zero Waste Masterplan in 2019, my Ministry and NEA have taken concrete steps to move from a throwaway culture towards a more sustainable paradigm. We are making good progress, addressing our priorities waste streams of electronic waste, or e-waste, packaging waste and food waste.Mr Louis Ng asked for an update on the e-waste Extended Producer Responsibility, or EPR, scheme that was implemented in July 2021. Since then, we have more than doubled the number of nationwide e-waste collection points, from 300 to over 700 today. These collection points are situated at accessible locations, like community centres and shopping malls.To date, ALBA, the appointed Producer Responsibility Scheme operator, has collected more than 9,000 tonnes of e-waste. It is a start, but is only a fraction of our collection targets. Since 1 July 2021, for Information Communication Technology (ICT) equipment, batteries and lamps, the collection rate is under 4%. We have done better for large household appliances, with a collection rate of 18%. There is still much room for improvement.Together with ALBA, we will roll out extensive publicity and outreach efforts throughout the year, across various marketing and online platforms, focusing on events such as International E-waste Day in October. ALBA has also worked with all 17 Town Councils to organise quarterly collection drives at housing estates to collect bulky e-waste.On 6 February 2023, I moved the Resource Sustainability (Amendment) Bill for first reading. There will be a full debate on the Bill during the Second Reading.Today, I will share more details on two key initiatives under the Bill: a disposable carrier bag charge and a beverage container return scheme. They are decisive steps to reduce packaging waste and increase recycling, including single-use plastics.First, on the disposable carrier bag charge. By making the cost of disposable bags visible to consumers, the charge will nudge consumers to be mindful of and reduce their usage of disposable bags. Based on NEA's 2021 survey of around 1,000 residents, close to 90% agreed that they had a part to play in reducing the usage of disposable carrier bags. More than 70% also agreed that a mandatory charge will help to reduce the usage of these bags.From Monday, 3 July 2023, supermarket operators with a company-level annual turnover of more than $100 million will be required to charge at least five cents per disposable carrier bag at their Singapore Food Agency (SFA)-licensed supermarket outlets. Following consultations with supermarket operators, we understand that the majority will be charging five cents per bag, and this would moderate potential cost impact on consumers. We can avoid the charge by bringing our own reusable bags.The mandatory charge will cover around 400, or about two-thirds, of all supermarket outlets. These include large supermarket chains, such as FairPrice, Cold Storage, Giant and Sheng Siong. These supermarkets will be easily identifiable through collaterals displayed at their premises. The mandatory charge would not apply at other retail outlets, such as convenience stores, as suggested by Mr Ng. Nevertheless, I note that many retailers already charge for bags voluntarily, including large convenience store chains, such as 7-Eleven and Cheers. We will monitor the effectiveness of the charge and assess the need to expand the mandatory coverage in the future.The charge will apply to all disposable carrier bags, not just plastic bags, as all bags require resources and generate carbon emissions during their production and disposal. Other similar schemes in Hong Kong, Taiwan and the UK, have led to a reduction of plastic bags used by 60% to 90%.We have heard concerns about supermarket operators profiting from the charge. I am happy to share that all covered supermarket operators have indicated that they intend to apply the charge proceeds towards environmental and social causes. For transparency and accountability, supermarket operators will be required to publish information on the number of bags issued, amount of proceeds collected and how the proceeds are used.Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked how we can balance the charge and the need for bags for waste disposal. The charge will not remove the public's access to disposable bags. Bags will still be available at supermarkets and other retail outlets. By reducing waste and recycling right, we will require fewer bags for waste disposal. Additionally, we can repurpose product packaging to bag waste, including toilet roll bags or packaging from online purchases.Second, a beverage container return scheme, which Mr Gan mentioned. The scheme is part of an EPR approach to manage packaging waste. Beverage producers will be responsible for collecting and recycling the products they put to market.Consumers will pay a small deposit when buying a pre-packaged beverage and receive a full refund when the empty beverage container is returned for recycling at a conveniently located return point. The scheme will cultivate recycling habits and aggregate clean and high-quality recyclables, which can be made into new products.The scheme framework has been developed following extensive stakeholder consultations since 2020. Around 80% of 1,000 households surveyed in 2021 generally supported implementing the scheme.The scheme will cover plastic bottles and metal cans of volumes ranging from 150 to 3,000 millilitres, for all types of pre-packaged beverages. Plastic bottles and metal cans comprise about 70% of beverage containers put to market. They are easy to collect, compactible and have high material value.Similar schemes have been implemented in over 50 jurisdictions, such as Norway and Sweden. Many have seen return rates increase to over 80%. For Singapore's beverage container return scheme, NEA will set an 80% return rate target on the scheme operator at steady state. With this, we expect about 800 million plastic bottles and metal cans to be returned for recycling annually.Even as we strengthen legislation to drive behaviour change, we must continue with outreach and education. Prof Koh Lian Pin spoke on The Waste Café. As noted in my Parliamentary Question reply yesterday, we will take into consideration the views of those who felt that this experiment could have been done differently, to improve our future campaigns.I also thank Prof Koh for his queries on our initiatives to encourage household recycling. On transparent recycling bins, we will be releasing our findings soon. On recycling chutes, HDB introduced dual chutes for refuse and recyclables for all new public housing developments from 2014. Since 2018, NEA has also required them at all new non-landed, private residential developments higher than four storeys.Mr Gan and Ms Hany Soh spoke on the contamination rate of recyclables, which is about 40%. In tandem with education campaigns, the E-waste EPR scheme, the upcoming beverage container return scheme and initiatives by other organisations to sort recyclables, such as paper and textiles, will reduce contamination in our blue bins.Members will be heartened to learn that all households can collect a Bloobox from vending machines deployed island-wide later this month, to set up a recycling corner. Designed by a team of students from the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), the Bloobox is foldable, reusable and light. It has labels to help households identify what can and cannot be recycled, with reminders that plastic bottles, metal cans and glass containers for recycling should be empty, and free of food and liquids. Members may pick up a Bloobox from the Parliament Library to start your own recycling corner.I will now speak about our hawker centres and hawker culture. Our hawker centres are an important institution, providing us with affordable and tasty hawker food. Miss Cheryl Chan and Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin asked about planning considerations for new hawker centres and markets, and the progress of the new hawker centres. Mr Pritam Singh also asked about plans for hawker centres in the Marina Bay Financial area.The Government had previously announced plans to build 20 new hawker centres, prioritising new estates and existing estates in the heartlands that are relatively under-served, in terms of affordable dining options. These sites are selected after carefully considering factors, including residential catchment, availability of comparable dining options and complementary facilities in the vicinity. This ensures the centres serves the demand of the residents, while avoiding over competition amongst comparable F&B establishments.Even as we build new centres, we need to ensure that there are hawkers and that they can make a decent livelihood.CBD hawker centres face additional challenges due to their heavy reliance on the working lunch crowd and the lack of residential catchment. Today, there are already existing food options in the CBD for workers. These include four hawker centres such as Market Street Hawker Centre that just reopened last year, as well as about 50 coffeeshops, food courts and canteens. Last year, four new hawker centres opened in Senja, Bukit Canberra, Fernvale and Punggol. Besides Market Street Hawker Centre, another redeveloped centre that commenced operations was Margaret Drive Hawker Centre. Repairs and Redecoration (R&R works) were also completed at 15 centres. Many Singaporeans have explored these centres as part of hawker centre hopping circuits, which is becoming a national pastime. Chairman, in Mandarin, please. (In Mandarin): [Please refer to Vernacular Speech.] This year, we can look forward to the opening of two new hawker centres in Buangkok and Woodleigh Village. Both hawker centres will have around 40 stalls and 700 seats. Both hawker centres will be connected to neighbourhood amenities and transport nodes, making it convenient for residents. The seating areas are spacious, family friendly, and inclusive. Ceilings are high to ensure better ventilation and airflow. Additionally, the refreshed Jurong West Hawker Centre is slated to reopen in the third quarter of 2023 after the completion of reconfiguration works. Besides these new centres, to enable our patrons to enjoy their meals in a pleasant and well-ventilated environment, we will also upgrade 25 existing hawker centres, including Holland Village Market and Food Centre and North Bridge Road Market and Food Centre.(In English): We are also futureproofing hawker centres through the Hawker Centres Transformation Programme (HTP). As Ms Nadia would be aware, we are piloting the HTP at Cheng San Market and Food Centre and Geylang Serai Market. NEA will be engaging stallholders before targeting to start works from 2024.  Let me address Ms Joan Pereira and Miss Cheryl Chan's questions about inflationary pressures and the impact on rental and cooked food prices.  We have provided hawkers with a conducive business environment including ensuring reasonable rentals at our hawker centres. For NEA's monthly tender exercises, we adopt a transparent and fair system with no minimum bid. Individuals can bid for a stall at a monthly rental as low as $1 per month, while others may submit higher bids to secure stalls at popular locations. After the first three years, rent is adjusted towards assessed market rent. In fact, only about 4% of cooked food stalls in hawker centres today are paying rent at above the assessed market rent. The remaining over 5,600 stallholders are paying rent no higher than the assessed market rate.Median rental across our non-subsidised cooked food stalls has remained constant at about $1,250 per month since 2018. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have also supported hawkers by providing 10 months of rental waiver and six months of subsidies for table cleaning and centralised dish-washing. In fact, stall rentals at hawker centres are generally lower than most other comparable food establishments in their vicinity. Nonetheless, rental only accounts for about 9% of our hawkers' operating costs. Hawkers price their food based on multiple factors including operating costs, location, business level and patron demographics. They delicately balance these factors to attract patrons while trying to make a decent living. Today, patrons can continue to find affordable options in our hawker centres – as Mr Singh also acknowledges – including the Socially-conscious Enterprise Hawker Centres (SEHCs), where operators have committed to provide at least one budget meal option per stall.To help Singaporeans cope with inflationary pressure, the Government is, among other measures, providing CDC and GST vouchers under the Assurance Package, and with more assistance provided to the lower income. CDC vouchers can be used at our hawker centres. The Government will continue to monitor the situation and consider if further support is needed. We are taking additional steps to futureproof our hawker centres. Under the Productive Hawker Centres (PHC) Programme, the Hawkers' Productivity Grant (HPG) provides co-funding to purchase kitchen automation and queue management equipment. Ms Rahayu Mahzam would be happy to know close to $3 million has been provided to more than 900 hawkers under the HPG. Additionally, eight existing centres have tapped on PHC funding to implement centre-level Centralised Dish Washing (CDW) and Automated Tray Return System (ATRS). Today, more than 70% of cooked food stallholders in our hawker centres are already using e-payment. Support groups have been set up at 37 hawker centres to help hawkers embrace digital opportunities. Mr Gan asked what can be done to support hawkers to digitalise. We will be expanding the HPG to include stall-level digital solutions such as e-ordering solutions which are becoming more widespread. We will maintain the co-funding quantum at 80% but will increase the total claimable amount from $5,000 to $7,000 per stallholder. The funding period will also be extended to March 2026. Additionally, we will broaden the ATRS component of the PHC programme to cover Cleaning Process Automation (CPA) solutions. This helps to address challenges such as ageing cleaners and rising manpower costs. Examples include autonomous systems that clean tables and transfer used trays and crockery from tray return points to centralised dishwashing areas. This will reduce cleaners' workload especially during peak hours. We will co-fund up to 80% of deployment costs incurred by the cleaning operator for CPA solutions. Coupled with the mandatory tray and crockery return, these would help to improve the cleanliness situation and bird nuisance issues raised by Ms Nadia. With everyone doing their part to return their used trays and crockery, we noticed that the situation has generally improved and bird nuisance feedback at hawker centres has been declining annually from 2019 to 2022. As we celebrate our veteran hawkers, I am also heartened by the new hawkers who have joined the trade. Miss Chan would be happy to hear that many of them have benefited from NEA's Incubation Stall Programme (ISP) and Hawkers' Development Programme (HDP). Together with other similar programmes by our SEHC operators, over 50 aspiring hawkers have joined the hawker trade through these programmes. As part of our tradition, you would have tried some hawker fare from our ISP and HDP hawkers at yesterday's tea break. This included delicious halal braised duck kway teow from an ISP stall by Jonathan Tan and Habri Hammad Bin Mohammad at Amoy Street Food Centre. Johnathan adapted his grandfather's Hokkien braised duck recipe into a halal recipe so the Muslim community can enjoy his food, while continuing his grandfather's legacy. We are constantly reviewing our programmes. Through feedback, we realised that additional emphasis on culinary readiness alongside close mentorship from hawker mentors will raise participants' chances of success. Therefore, the HDP's classroom programme will spend more time honing culinary skills. At the apprenticeship stage, hawker mentors will also help to assess the participants' culinary readiness. Participants can have the option to extend their apprenticeship by four more weeks, on top of the current eight weeks. Finally, we have also received feedback that some local snacks are increasingly less commonly found. Those selling such snacks usually find it difficult to sustain an entire cooked food stall. We will work with SEHCs operators to pilot the use of kiosks, which would incur lower rental and operating cost to support the sale of snacks such as muah chee and putu piring. We hope this will help to preserve these snacks as part of our hawker culture. We will monitor the viability of such kiosks before deciding if we should scale up this pilot.Chairman, I am heartened that many Members have called on Singaporeans to embrace sustainability, reduce consumption and green business practices. I remember the slogan \"Courtesy begins with you and me\". Likewise, \"Sustainability begins with you and me\". The Government cannot build a green nation alone. I urge everyone to incorporate sustainable practices into your daily routines, starting with the three Rs and support our hawkers to sustain our hawker culture. The Chairman: Senior Minister of State Dr Koh Poh Koon.\n",

      "A multi-disciplinary consultancy study will holistically plan the development of LCK and the adjoining West Johor Strait. For example, we are exploring siting our fish hatcheries and other key infrastructural and processing facilities on land, to provide support to both land-based and sea-based fish farms. We will also incorporate upcoming regional studies for coastal protection measures at the LCK coastline, to enable our farms to be climate resilient.  Some of these ideas will be showcased in the LCK Master Plan exhibition, which SFA will launch in the second half of 2023. I hope Members will look out for the exhibition when it is finally launched.In the East Johor Strait shown on the slide, which is separated by the Causeway from the West Johor Strait, we have a distinct and separate cluster of fish farms, supported by key aquaculture facilities. The separation of the fish farms into two distinct clusters is especially important to enhance fish resiliency in the face of climate change, which may result in harmful algal blooms as has happened in the past before.Miss Cheryl Chan and Prof Koh Lian Pin asked how aquaculture would contribute to our \"30 by 30\" goal. Prof Koh Lian Pin also asked how we would ensure that the development of aquaculture in sea spaces is environmentally sustainable. We have identified fish production as one of our priority areas. It is a nutritious source of protein that can be grown efficiently. This is why we launched the Singapore Aquaculture Plan last year, to transform the sector in three ways. First, to increase and optimise spaces for farming. Secondly, to help the industry adopt technology and better farm practices. And thirdly, to invest in research and innovation.Miss Cheryl Chan asked how lessons from other countries with established aquaculture industries can be applied to our context.We plan to conduct a joint study trip this year with industry and academia, to countries with advanced aquaculture production, to understand how they have managed to grow their commercial aquaculture sectors without negatively impacting marine biodiversity.SFA will also dedicate significant resources and work closely with industry and academics to enhance our understanding of the effects of aquaculture on our local marine environment. For example, SFA is collaborating with NUS and the Barramundi Group to study the impact of aquaculture on the marine environment and marine life surrounding St John’s Island. The study will conduct reef surveys and measure water and sediment quality prospectively over a period of time, to better understand in real-time, how aquaculture practices and farming activities could potentially affect these environmental parameters. We will adopt relevant practices from our overseas learning trip and detailed insights gained from our own local studies to suit our Singapore context.To further support Singapore's ambitions in leading aquaculture research and innovation, we will enhance our R&D facilities to attract more companies and researchers to base themselves here. In November 2022, we launched AquaPolis to transform the aquaculture research landscape. The brain trust of AquaPolis will comprise scientists from various research institutions, including the National University of Singapore (NUS), Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory and many others.They will work on addressing real world aquaculture challenges to enhance the productivity of farms and quality of fish farmed in Singapore. For example, by developing superior fingerlings with traits, such as faster growth rates and higher Omega-3 content and reducing fish mortality from common fish diseases.SFA's Marine Aquaculture Centre, located on St John's Island, will serve as the anchor research campus of AquaPolis. We will undertake two new initiatives.First, we will enhance its facilities with upgrades, such as the installation of recirculating aquaculture systems for research in intensive farming within closed environments, to cater to evolving R&D needs. Second, we will also embark on a study to review how our future research facilities can be better integrated with aquaculture infrastructure, such as jetties and hatcheries.In the steady state, our Singapore Aquaculture Plan will comprise three distinct centres, as you can see on the slide: the West Johor Strait, the East Johor Strait and AquaPolis in the Southern Waters. This will provide critical diversification of our aquaculture production across three different sites and ensures our aquaculture sector expands in a climate-resilient manner. The enhanced research capabilities and facilities will also be better integrated with aquaculture infrastructure. Miss Cheryl Chan asked about plans to build the manpower pipeline for our farming industry.For students, Republic Polytechnic has broadened the scope of their Diploma in Biotechnology to include a specialisation in Food and Agro-technologies. For mid-career professionals, SFA partnered with Workforce Singapore and Republic Polytechnic in 2022 to launch a Career Conversion Programme to equip them with the knowledge and skills as Agri-tech Specialists or Agri-tech Operators. I am glad to announce that for Nitec and Higher Nitec graduates as well as in-service employees, a new Work-Study Diploma in Agriculture and Aquaculture Technology will be launched by ITE next month. This will provide them with engineering skills to operate new agriculture and aquaculture systems, knowledge about food crops cultivation and fish farm management.We will, therefore, have training programmes for different segments of the workforce to meet the agri-food industry's manpower needs. As we encourage our local farms to produce more, there must be sufficient demand for our local produce. I thank Ms Hany Soh for her suggestion for Government to demonstrate support for local produce in food procurement. I agree that this is an area we should study further. In February, a new Alliance for Action (AfA) on \"Demand Offtake and Consumer Education\" was formed, as part of the Forward Singapore conversation. The AfA includes key members of our local food ecosystem, such as representatives from farms, off-takers, such as supermarkets and trade associations representing the hotels, the retailers, as well as the catering associations, supported by various agencies, like Singapore Tourism Board (STB) and Enterprise Singapore. Together, they will explore solutions to help the hotel, restaurants and catering sector, as well as our local consumers, embrace local produce. I look forward to hearing their ground up recommendations that will further develop our local agricultural industry. Sir, in Mandarin, please.(In Mandarin): [Please refer to Vernacular Speech.] Food is an existential concern for Singapore as we import more than 90% of our food supply. Over the past two years, we have experienced first-hand the effects of disruption to our food supply chain. Many consumers have readily embraced alternatives, for example, by buying thawed frozen chickens from Australia and Thailand, or by switching to other protein types, such as fish and eggs. To further strengthen our food resilience, we are pressing ahead with our \"30 by 30\" goal of building our agri-food industry’s capability to produce 30% of our nutritional needs locally and sustainably by 2030. To ensure the continuous growth of local agriculture, the next key step is to grow demand for local produce. In February, a new Alliance for Action (AfA) on \"Demand Offtake and Consumer Education\" was formed, as part of the ForwardSG conversation, including representatives from farming, food processing, hospitality and F&B sectors.AfA will look into demand and supply aggregation of local produce and build greater mindshare for local produce through consumer education. Recommendations from AfA will strengthen our food supply resilience. The development of our agriculture industry depends on the support from Singaporeans for our local produce. (In English): Ms Nadia Samdin asked how SFA will innovate to bolster its food safety capabilities. SFA is developing Whole Genome Sequencing analytics to better identify the causes of foodborne diseases, and to help prevent outbreaks. We will strengthen SFA's use of data analytics to identify food establishments with higher risks of food safety lapses, enabling our officers to conduct more targeted inspections and educate poorer performing food establishments to tighten their food safety practices. We will also invest in deep technology to ensure that our food safety regime keeps pace with industry innovation. Dr Lim Week Kiak about progress in novel foods. Since SFA approved the sale of cultured meat in 2020, a global first, we have seen a steady increase in applications for the sale of novel foods. Most recently, SFA gave regulatory approval to GOOD Meat for the use of serum-free media in the production of cultivated meat.  We will set aside $23 million, under the Singapore Food Story R&D Programme 2.0, the national R&D programme for food, to build new food safety capabilities to cater to developments in the novel foods space. SFA will support research projects to develop new methodologies which aim to provide more timely assessments, including toxicity and allergenicity assessments for novel and alternative proteins.I thank Ms Nadia Samdin for her suggestions to enhance our food safety framework to encourage industry to maintain good food safety standards, including our home-based businesses and food sold through online platforms. Home-based food businesses are not licensed by SFA as they pose relatively low food safety risks due to their small scale. They are still subjected though to prevailing food safety regulations and should comply with SFA's regulations and guidelines on proper food handling practices.In January, a new Singapore Standard was launched to guide food e-commerce players on their roles and responsibilities related to food safety. The guidelines were co-developed with a wide range of stakeholders, from food e-commerce platforms to food delivery platforms as well as supermarket retailers. Food safety is a joint responsibility. I am heartened to see strong industry support in committing towards best practices in providing food safety information to consumers and improving traceability and recall along the food e-commerce chain.Next, I will touch on coastal and flood protection, which Dr Lim Wee Kiak, Mr Edward Chia, Ms Nadia Samdin as well as Ms Poh Li San asked about. Singapore is a low-lying island. Thirty percent of our land area is less than five metres above the mean sea level. With climate change, the Centre for Climate Research Singapore estimates that the mean sea level around Singapore could increase by up to one metre by 2100. This will affect many stretches of our coastline. Combined with the effects of more sudden and extreme rainfall as well as storm surges, we can expect greater risks to the community, our infrastructure, and our livelihood.  PUB, our national coastal protection agency, has been making steady progress and will periodically refine our coastal protection plans.To Mr Edward Chia's question, since May 2021, we have progressively launched several studies to understand the characteristics of Singapore's coastlines and develop targeted coastal protection measures. PUB will commence the next site-specific study for the Sungei Kadut and the Lim Chu Kang area in the second half of this year.I agree with Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Ms Nadia Samdin that these present opportunities to shape climate resilience efforts with the public. In conjunction with the Forward Singapore exercise, PUB started the Our Coastal Conversation series, and conducted two dialogue sessions for the City-East Coast area in October 2022.Participants from diverse backgrounds, corporates, community groups, NGOs and even schools, participated in the dialogue and raised interesting perspectives on the trade-offs that we would need to make to tackle the effects of climate change. For example, some participants raised issues like, how would we retain the scenic views and the convenient access to the beaches that we enjoy while, at the same, looking at how we protect our coastlines, including the coastal nature parks. I would like to reassure Ms Nadia Samdin that we will continue to work closely with our stakeholders on topics, such as coastal protection and other topics like marine litter. Last year, we published Singapore's first National Action Strategy on Marine Litter in consultation with our people, public and private sectors.In addition to trade-offs, coastal protection is a long-term endeavour and requires new technologies and innovations, as Ms Poh Li San and Prof Koh Lian Pin had pointed out. I am pleased to announce that we will launch a new dedicated Coastal Protection and Flood Management Research Programme (CFRP), funded by the National Research Foundation, to strengthen long-term coastal protection and inland flood management capabilities in Singapore. The CFRP will provide $125 million to foster research and collaboration across academia and the industry. This will establish a vibrant R&D ecosystem to support the development of innovative coastal protection and flood management solutions.  I agree with Prof Koh Lian Pin that we should work with industry and consider solutions that they can offer. The CFRP’s applied research and living lab components will support the test-bedding of inter-disciplinary urban flood solutions and equip our industries with the capability to develop and eventually export the next generation of coastal and flood protection solutions. The CFRP will be anchored by a Centre of Excellence, hosted by National University of Singapore (NUS). More details will be provided later this year.Beyond sea level rises, climate change will also bring about increased and more intense rainfall, as we experienced in the last two days.Ms Nadia Samdin, Ms Poh Li San and Mr Edward Chia asked about drainage and coastal protection infrastructure plans. Mr Edward Chia also asked about how these will be financed. Since 2011, the Government has invested around $2 billion on drainage improvement works. We have set aside another $1.4 billion to carry out further improvements to the drainage system from 2021 to 2025. Drainage improvement works in 25 locations are currently ongoing, including the expansion of the Bukit Timah Canal. PUB is exploring solutions that address the combined effects of sea level rise and intense rainfall and will continue to collaborate with agencies to co-create multi-functional drainage solutions.One funding source is the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund, set up in 2020 with an initial injection of $5 billion. But the cost to expand our drainage to cater for every extreme rainfall event is prohibitive. We must therefore strengthen our community resilience and collective response to how we deal with floods.I encourage everyone to stay updated on PUB's flood alerts. Please sign on to their Telegram alert system if you have not done so, and for property owners and developers to ensure that the flood protection measures in your own developments remain effective.Mr Chairman, as a small city-state with no natural resources, we must adapt and evolve to the constant changes around us.We will continue to strengthen our resilience against existential threats by reimagining our coastlines as we explore new coastal protection measures, improving our drainage infrastructure to withstand more intense rainfall, and building a more food resilient Singapore. Whether it is mitigating the effects of climate change or strengthening our food resilience, each and every one of us has a role to play. My Ministry will work in partnership with all Singaporeans to build a more resilient Singapore.The Chairman: Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey Yam Keng.\n",

      "Thank you, Chairman. I thank Minister Grace Fu and the whole team in MSE for leading the whole nation in this green transition. It is not easy. I have one question for Minister Grace Fu. She mentioned that Pandan Reservoir will also be expanded to include the floating solar farms. I would like to know, from the Tengeh Reservoir experience, how is biodiversity in the water in the reservoir affected with solar panels.I have another question for Senior Minister of State Koh. I am heartened to learn about the set-up of the Coastal Protection and Flood Management Research Programme (CFRP) to have an applied research and living lab in NUS. May I know how do we intend to bring in talents to do the research, and also, will we be looking at courses for students at NUS to support this effort?And the last question is for Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey. In the fight against dengue, I understand that to expand Project Wolbachia, we have to increase mosquito productions from two million to five million every week. That is a lot of mosquitoes. How do we sustain this effort over the long run? What is MSE's strategy?\n",
      "\n",
      "Chairman, I would like to thank Ms Poh for her clarifications.On Pandan Reservoir, I would like to assure Members that before we embark on the project, we will do the appropriate environmental study, just as we have done for Tengeh, and also for Bedok. It is important for us to take a holistic evaluation on the impact on the environment, and Members, as well as members of the public, can rest assured that PUB will do the right thing of studying before we embark on it.We had taken care of it when we did Tengeh, situating the solar panels where we are limiting the size, where we think that it is appropriate for the animals and the birds in the area. We will similarly do the same for Pandan Reservoir.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chairman, I thank Prof Koh Lian Pin for a very thoughtful question. I totally agree with him about the need to create excellence in Singapore but at the same time have a strong local anchor so that Singaporeans will find exciting career and also will be able to create value as we move towards sustainability.I think the example that Senior Minister of State Koh Poh Koon has mentioned earlier about the climate protection and flood management centre that we have just announced is a very clear illustration of how we intend to do that. It is a centre that is located in NUS, with strong anchors – not just in NUS but in various IHLs that have capabilities in related issues. It also intends to pull in disciplines from other centres that are related to coastal protection and flood management. For example, if we consider nature-based solutions, then expertise in this area will have to be incorporated.At the same time, we talked about a living lab where interesting solutions that have worked elsewhere, we need to refine, we need to test and we need to pilot it, to ensure that they are effective in the Singapore context. This is where overseas expertise and local companies can jointly work on such projects, and therefore, anchoring, transferring and absorbing some of these foreign expertise into the local talent pool.Senior Minister of State Koh Poh Koon has also talked about how we intend to engage students in PhD projects and also in the Masters project to ensure that we have sufficient people in the pipeline to enable us to undertake this project that is going to be massive, that is going to be huge, that is going to be significant and at the same time, it is going to take many decades.It is going to be a multi-billion-dollar and multi-decade undertaking, just as we have done for the water security story, the coastal protection part of it is going to be a new area where we expect international collaboration, foreign ideas and innovations that we should be open to accept, while at the same time, finding our own local applications that is relevant and cost-effective to us. I would also like to just refer Members to what has been announced under the MTI COS debate, that a Green Skills Committee will be set up to look at creating greater capabilities and developing more expertise in the areas of sustainability and green economy.This is a very exciting area. It cuts across many sectors. It is both vertical, like coastal protection; and horizontal, cutting across sustainability, verification and management reporting of carbon emissions. So, there are many opportunities and lots of work ahead of us, and we want to see how we can bring greater coordination between the public, private and people sectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Chairman, we expected Mr Louis Ng to ask \"what's next?\", even as and when we announce the first step. I would just like to assure Members that we would definitely want to go as fast as possible. Focusing on our target of 2030 and realising that green procurement has its impact of expanding the introduction of new, more environmentally friendly products and services; and also, hopefully, as a pathfinder, introduce more technologies and introducing scale, so that we can help to bring down the costs of such products and services. So, we are very mindful about the impact that we can play.But at the same time, I think several Members in the House, Mr Chairman, have also asked that we do it in a way that is inclusive, so that all our companies, our SMEs are also brought along this journey.Balancing the pace is a bit like the Goldilocks problem – not too hot, not too cold, just right.We should not go too slowly, but neither should we go too quickly, but we should do it just right. We will take the lessons learned from the first tranche that we will be implementing. Members can be assured that we will want to go as quickly as we can.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thank the Minister, the two Senior Ministers of State and Senior Parliamentary Secretary for their responses. I just have one clarification question. As Singapore pursues our ambition to be a climate services hub, we are seeding our ecosystem of sustainability solutions providers by welcoming and working with international partners. I think it makes a lot of sense to attract the best people and best organisations here quickly, to support us.At the same time, I would like to hear the Minister's thoughts on what more can we do. How can we ensure that there is sufficient investment and coordination across our public, private and people sectors to nurture world-class sustainability champions, leaders and institutions of our own, to service both Singapore and the global community?\n",

      "Let me take the first question on disposable carrier bag charge.I have just announced that we are going to start charging on 3 July 2023, Monday. So, we have not even started. But having said that, the issue is not about charging for disposable carrier bags. The idea of doing this is to nudge a change in behaviour, to get people to think more before they take that bag, to reduce their use; and if possible, even not to use it.You are talking about small little bags, why do you need to use it? Put in the pocket, put in the bag, your handbag and so on, and you do not actually need. So, the idea is to nudge a change in behaviour.If indeed, once we start this, there is a significant change in behaviour, then there is no need to expand it because people will change their behaviour automatically, they will not take the bags if they do not need to. And also, other organisations may follow suit in charging for bags just to help nudge behaviour. So, I think we need to monitor and do not jump the gun.I also want to thank the Member for asking a clarification on second-hand smoke. Thank you, indeed, because frankly, I ran out of time. And it was not my pet subject, so I had to choose. [Laughter.] Yes, but thank you, now I can continue with the rest of my speech.Mr Chairman: Sounds like \"kelong\". [Laughter.]\n",
      "\n",
      "I thank the Member for her suggestions. Indeed, we can work with the grassroots, the local advisors, as well as to via the Green Action for Communities programme, which Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey was talking about, in order to look at outreach and education efforts, as well as increasing awareness about recycle and nudging people to adopt such green habits. So, we can do so. We have got our NEA officers on the ground too, and we can work to this as well as through the Green Action for Communities programme.With regards to supermarket operators, we are already engaging the supermarket operators. I have just announced that all the supermarket operators have already agreed that they are going to use the proceeds from the bag charge for environmental and social causes. And one of them could be giving out reusable bags to the community, to encourage them to use that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you, Sir. I thank Minister for the good news about the green procurement, the disposable carrier bag charge. Could I ask whether we have a timeline in terms of when we will expand the green procurement practices and the disposable bag charge? And whether the Ministry will consider publishing a roadmap for these expansions, similar to what we have done for our carbon tax?Second, I am sure Senior Minister of State Amy Khor did not do this on purpose, but she did not respond to my cuts on second-hand smoke. Could I ask her whether we can do a public consultation or set up a citizens workgroup to tackle this issue of second-hand smoke?\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, the work of MSE is a very diverse and very important one. It covers the food we eat, the environment we live in, the water we drink and, of course, the future of humankind, in terms of protecting our planet and fighting climate change. And I did not forget and did not run out of time – the air we breathe, second-hand smoke as well.I know I ask some difficult questions, especially to Senior Minister of State Amy, but since she says she is immune to it, we can continue. But I want to record my sincere appreciation for the hard work by all the office holders, the team and staff members at MSE, NEA, PUB, SFA. Thank you for all your hard work.I thank all the Members of Parliament who have spoken up as well, to question our policies, to make our policies better, and I should also record our thanks to Chairman and the team at Parliament, for greening Parliament. For again, ending the use of disposable cups, for turning up the air-con temperature, so we sweat it out as we debate here – all in the spirit of cutting our emissions.And I hope, Chairman, will note that I am the first Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) to thank you in the wrap-up speech. But you should take note of me as Louis Ng, not Louis Chua. [Laughter.] With that, Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.The sum of $2,432,080,200 for Head L ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates.The sum of $1,056,918,300 for Head L ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you, Chairman. I have three supplementary questions, two is for Senior Minister of State Amy Khor. I am heartened to hear about the plans to be rolled out on the International E-Waste Day, which is in October. But apart from that, could NEA also look into how the three Ps can come together, to increase awareness in other aspects.For example, the World Environment Day in June, and coming up very soon, the Global Recycling Day on 18 March, so that we can encourage more active recycling and for the community to collectively take the lead to further reduce the contamination rate of our recyclables.The second question is on the charging for plastic bags. During Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC's Green Action Communities deep dive, one of the suggestions is actually to explore how the community can collaborate with supermarkets to incentivise and encourage Bring Your Own Bag (BYOB) initiatives. So, how can the Ministry facilitate to link up the community and these supermarkets, so as to organise more of such green sustainable initiatives.Thirdly, for Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey, in relations to the Project Wolbachia, I understand that it has been rolled out and it is intended to ramp up to more HDB blocks and also landed homes. Can I also clarify that whether we are also exploring, if we have sufficient numbers, to release it to the private condominiums as well, as during the peak periods. For example, in Wood Grove, I have seven condominiums, there is actually a cluster for these condominiums.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head L of the Estimates be reduced by $100\".Sir, during the debate on the Carbon Pricing (Amendment) Bill, I did not raise my hand but Mr Speaker thought he saw my hand raised and called me for my clarification. I do hope he does this more often and calls my name; my correct name more often as well. But for that occasion, I really did not raise my hand and I replied to him that, for once, I have no questions.And that is the truth. I had no questions as I sincerely believe that we are heading in the right direction in terms of our climate policies. There is no doubt there is still work to be done but we have done so much in the past few years to not just adapt to climate change but, most importantly, mitigate climate change. We are significantly cutting our emissions and getting everyone on board on this important journey to save our planet. We have also done a phenomenal job in our #SayYesToWasteLess campaign and for all of us to go zero waste. The Extended Producer Responsibility, the upcoming disposable carrier bag charge, the Deposit Refund Scheme are all steps in the right direction and positively respond to the calls by so many activists who have called for these for many years.We are also taking active steps to solve problems we all face on the ground. We will be more effective in tackling high rise litter with the recent amendments to the Environmental Public Health Act and  is proving a vital tool in our efforts to combat dengue. We are also uplifting our lower income workers with the Progressive Wage Model (PWM) for workers in our cleaning and waste management sectors. We are also doing well in advancing food resilience and security, ensuring water sustainability and transforming and uplifting the hawker industry. Now that we done so much and done so well in all the above aspects, we now have some breathing space and some time to devote to tackling second-hand smoke. Our residents need their breathing space and need us to change our policies so they can protect themselves and their loved ones from the dangers of second-hand smoke. Like climate change, you cannot just adapt to secondhand smoke. Like complaints about high-rise littering, complaints about secondhand smoke is rising, it is doubled. And like high-rise littering, we need to amend our policies and even our laws to tackle secondhand smoke. Like , we can be creative and come up with ways to detect, deter and wipe out secondhand smoke. I know Senior Minister of State Amy Khor is equally concerned about secondhand smoke and I know that we can move forward on this issue like so many other issues I have debated her in this House over the years. There are lots more issues to cover. I know my Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) colleagues, fellow Members of Parliament and I will be asking lots more questions and I look forward to a robust debate. Question proposed.\n",

      "The Public Service is one of the biggest users of services in Singapore. Its procurement contracts are very significant in value. Public agencies abide by the procurement principles of transparency, open and fair competition and value for money. For many years, I have called for sustainability to be included as a principle of Government procurement. I have also called to expand life cycle costing to more categories of products, by measuring and setting standards for carbon footprint and publishing a yearly sustainability report. Many of our Government contractors also service other clients. When we tighten our sustainability requirements, it can spark process improvements across the supply chain, creating a multiplier effect.Can the Government share how it is driving green procurement to create a green economy? Will the Government introduce a green procurement roadmap similar to our carbon tax roadmap to help businesses prepare and change mindsets much earlier? \n",

      "Sir, I have been raising the tackling of e-waste for many years now. It is an issue close to my heart as I see so much wastage of precious resources. E-waste that is improperly handled can also be toxic and damage the environment. I am glad we are finally seeing progress in terms of tackling e-waste. E-waste bins are now a common sight in our neighbourhoods and malls. The Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) System for e-waste ensures the proper handling of e-waste and that valuable resources can be extracted. Given that it has been two years since the e-waste EPR was implemented, can the Ministry provide an update whether the scheme has been successful in increasing e-waste recycling rates? Can the Ministry share what other measures it is studying to further increase e-waste recycling rates?It has been almost five years since I delivered an Adjournment Motion to call for a charge on single-use carrier bags. Five years later, this has become a reality and we will soon be debating a Bill to make a disposable carrier bag charge at supermarkets compulsory.Many supermarkets and shops have already started to charge for disposable bags. I am glad that many Singaporeans have adapted to this. I often see shoppers bring their own reusable bags or decline to take disposable bags for small items. I believe we are starting to see a mindset shift.Can the Ministry share whether we will look into extending the requirements to convenience stores? In particular, the small disposable carrier bags for small convenience stores purchases are often unnecessary. Can the Government provide a roadmap for the expansion of the disposable carrier bag charge so that people and businesses know where we are heading towards and can prepare for it?I am sure Senior Minister of State Amy Khor is tired of hearing me repeat myself and of repeating her replies even though she just told me that she is immune to it. I continue to raise the issue of second-hand smoke because it continues to be a problem many people face and people continue to have no solutions that will protect them from the dangers of second-hand smoke. Second-hand smoke kills and is a public health issue rather than a neighbourly dispute. Many times, we tell our residents that the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals (CDRT) may be a solution.Let me share the voice of Ms Chong. She shared how even a CDRT court order was powerless to help protect her family from second-hand smoke. She shared the following in a forum letter, “A chain-smoking neighbour exposes my family to smoke every single day. The exposure to toxic second-hand smoke has greatly affected our health, living and lives. My mother often suffers from coughing and throat irritation, which make it difficult for her to eat as she chokes easily. We obtained a court order from the CDRT in June 2022, but this was not enough to stop the smoking.”To help Ms Chong and so many other residents, can the Ministry conduct a public consultation and set up a citizens’ workgroup to study the issue of second-hand smoke in homes?\n",

Our water treatment infrastructure and technologies have enabled us to move towards long-term water sustainability. The Public Utilities Board (PUB) has the ambitious goal of increasing NEWater supply capacity by up to 55% of demand by 2060.The tunnelling works for the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (DTSS) Phase 2 was about 80% completed as of April 2022. With COVID-19, the timelines of various infrastructure projects were delayed due to manpower shortages and supply chain disruptions.When is PUB expecting to complete Phase 2 of the DTSS project? On a related note, would the Minister share an update on the progress of the Tuas Water Reclamation Plant as well as the Kranji Water Reclamation Plant?Apart from the DTSS and Tuas and Kranji plants, are there new used water treatment plants in the plans? How will such developments improve Singapore's water supply resilience?Correspondingly, with the increase in electricity tariffs and the Public Sector's goal to achieve net zero earlier by 2045, how will these pressures affect the cost and quantity of NEWater production?Finally, will the Ministry also share an update on the investments made by PUB in science and technology solutions to increase the energy efficiency of our water treatment?

There is urgency in coastal protection. Do we have the time and the capacity to test out potential solutions? Would the Ministry share an update on how we are building up research, innovation and engineering capabilities to apply against the threat of rising sea levels?  How are we collaborating in terms of research and exploration of new ideas with other countries in the same predicament? How can we involve members of the public, Government agencies, research centres and the private sector to tap upon their collective suggestions for solutions and measures to protect our coastal areas?With climate change, we are also experiencing more intense rainfall. A case in point, we experienced the heaviest rainfall yesterday in 30 years of 225.5 millimetres of daily total rainfall.In January this year, PUB announced that a study to assess the feasibility of using an underground drainage and reservoir system to combat inland and coastal flooding will start in 2023.Would the Ministry share more about PUB's plans to develop flood protection measures and integrate these with coastal protection?Over the years, dengue remains as one of the biggest public health threats. In 2022, there were more than 32,000 dengue cases in 2022 and about six times the total number of cases recorded in 2021.More alarmingly, dengue can kill. In 2022, there were 19 dengue deaths – four times more than 2021. I understand that quite a number of estates had asked when  will be extended to more areas, especially for their areas.  Would the Ministry share how successful has this project been in areas where it had been launched? It takes time and resources to breed this special type of male mosquitoes. Would the Ministry share an update on the progress of ? Will the programme be extended to more areas in the near future?

Will the Government share the quality considerations and criteria for identifying eligible carbon projects' host countries, carbon crediting programmes and carbon accounting methodologies for carbon tax offsets in Singapore?Last year, the Government launched the Forward Singapore exercise to engage all segments of society to discuss the challenges, constraints and opportunities that Singapore faces as we move forward to realise our common vision for the future.Can the Government provide an update on the Steward Pillar of Forward Singapore and how Singaporeans are wanting to contribute towards a green, liveable and climate-resilient Singapore?  Since 2019, the National Environment Agency's (NEA) \"Say YES to Waste Less\" campaign has introduced initiatives to reduce food wastage and discourage the use of disposables such as bags, cups and takeout containers.Recently, NEA commissioned a campaign called The Waste Cafe, which generated some negative feedback from the public.How is the Government ensuring that future campaigns that seek to create public awareness, sometimes understandably through a shock factor, will not inadvertently lead to unnecessary waste? Will the Government share the outcomes of this campaign?Domestic recycling is an important part of Singapore's sustainability journey.

      "Thank you, Chairman. In 2021, the public sector launched GreenGov.SG to lead Singapore's pursuit of sustainable national development, as laid out in the . Under GreenGov.SG, the public sector aims to reach ambitious sustainability targets in carbon abatement and resource efficiency as well as influence support and enable green efforts nationwide, whether these are initiated by individuals, community groups or the private sector.Under GreenGov.SG, the public sector aims to peak its carbon emissions around 2025, ahead of the national target. Specific targets are set for buildings, information technology (IT), transport and solar deployment. Public sector infrastructure and operations, such as public transport, infrastructure and healthcare facilities, are included. May I ask the Minister to elaborate on how this will be done, without affecting the quality of public services? Will such efforts entail higher costs, leading to higher fees? If so, what measures are there to mitigate these increases, particularly in view of the inflationary environment currently? In addition, how will the Minister ensure that the public sector's organs, Ministries, and statutory boards meet the set targets? Would MSE share how GreenGov.SG will work with Singaporeans and residents and the private sector to reach its ambitious goals? Can the Government provide an update on our progress so far and what lies ahead? The Ministry had shared that to enable a sustainable economy, it would require the public sector to engage in green procurement. Hence, products must meet high efficiency or sustainability standards. This requirement will apply to a very wide range, from electrical appliances to building materials.  The Government will factor in companies' sustainability-related policies and practices when evaluating Government tenders, including event venues, accommodation, public waste collection contracts and so on. I am curious how wide the scope would be and to what extent items will be evaluated. For example, as meat accounts for nearly 60% of all greenhouse gases from food production, does it mean less meat at events organised by the public sector?  I look forward to the public sector's green procurement becoming an exciting new opportunity for our home-grown companies. It is very important to support our SMEs as the public sector transits to green procurement. SMEs may face significant obstacles in their attempts to bid for and win public procurement contracts for many reasons, including their limited resources, lack of knowledge about the new green requirements, unfamiliarity with possibly lengthy and difficult bidding processes and so on. I appeal to the Government to make an effort during this transition phase to provide support for our SMEs.How is the Government driving green procurement, so as to help SMEs and to engender a green economy?\n",

Having actual data tracked routinely will help our organisations to get a better understanding of their choices in the course of their actions, enabling them to make better decisions in the future. This will lead to a more responsible and efficient allocation of resources and capital as well as to expedite Singapore's transition to become a more sustainable nation with low carbon emissions.

The investment market and customers have demanded a greater transparency for useful climate change risks and opportunities information related to businesses. In a way, this demand has become so strong that businesses that fail to disclose their climate change risks could jeopardise their reputations. However, reputational risk do not solely apply to businesses only, they have similar implications for any Government. I would like to touch on two areas. First, the need for disclosure from businesses and Government. From FY 2023, it is mandatory for public-listed companies under the Singapore Exchange (SGX) beginning with specific sectors to make climate disclosures. More sectors will be included from FY 2024. However, there has not been any requirement made on the Government and its agencies. While we have the intended strategies in place as a nation, we also need instruments to monitor and measure against the targets set on a continuous basis.As the Government is the regulator and governing structure in Singapore, are there any plans for the Government to provide similar disclosures annually, in order to send strong signals about our commitment to combat climate change?Second, the provisioning and allocation of allowances for carbon emissions. The Carbon Pricing (Amendment) Bill was passed in November 2022. Given how heavily trade exposed our economy is, such a provision is vital to ensure our businesses remain competitive as they adjust towards a low-carbon economy. However, the Act does not define clear boundaries on how much allowances the Government will be allowed to issue and how these will be allocated from a sectorial perspective. This brings me to the point about volume of allowance, its fair allocation and integrity of businesses using the allowance. On the provisioning of allowances, could the Minister clarify the estimated volume of allowances the Government is planning to issue as part of the transition framework? How will the volume be calibrated over the years as Singapore progressively lowers our carbon intensity? Will the Ministry consider introducing a cap on the number of allowances that can be issued annually to safeguard against any overprovision of allowances from a national perspective?On the allocation of allowances, could the Minister also clarify how the Government plans to allocate allowances across the different sectors?As the businesses liable for carbon tax can have differing strategic importance to Singapore, how will the Government benchmark a business which provides critical infrastructure, such as the power sector, versus another business which serves as a growth engine in new emerging economy?While the current provision allows internationally recognised benchmarks to be applied in the methodology of assessing the award of allowances, it does not obligate the use of benchmarking elements.I would like to seek clarification on how the Government will track the carbon intensity performance of a business benefiting from such allowances. Will there be regular benchmarking reviews on its carbon intensity performance against global peers? How would feedback loops be put in place to adjust the allowances issued based on the benchmarking results?\n",

      "Chairman, with an increasingly volatile climate pattern and supply disruptions, COVID-19 has only reiterated the importance for Singapore to enhance our self-reliance in basic supplies. Singapore’s \"30 by 30\" goal is definitely a step in the right direction, leveraging agri-tech to help production in eggs, seafood and vegetables to meet the  targets. In the 2022 Committee of Supply (COS), there was an effort to transform the aquaculture sector – from providing existing farmers with Temporary Occupation Licences to reducing the farm culture licence fee. Yet, that is only the starting point to convert existing farms and solutions. Aquaculture itself is a complex ecosystem. This includes impact on land and water resources, studies on the life cycle of different breeds of fish and crustaceans, health of each breed under varying environmental conditions, how to manage controlled parameters for healthy breed of produce, availability of efficacious vaccines for intervention and to promote growth of fry and fingerlings. Efforts are also required to translate the lab trials to open waters.All in all, it is a huge science that the industry needs to finesse with the researchers, engineers and biologist experts.  I seek the Minister to provide an update on the detailed plans of how aquaculture will support our \"30 by 30\" ambition. To better support the industry, what is put in place to build the pipeline of researchers, technologists and industry partners to manage the trade? Given our climate conditions which are different from those in temperate regions where aquaculture sector is more advanced, can the Minister explain how we are developing and applying learnings in this area for the tropics?\n",

      "Chairman, with the green transition, there will be a learning curve for companies and workers, and both must meet new conditions. Some businesses may be unable to keep up while others will find new opportunities. Some workers will be made redundant, but others will find themselves in high demand for their new expertise. Even households are not spared from needing to adapt to greening. They must learn new habits to save water and electricity, reduce and recycle waste, for example. How will the Government support businesses, households and individuals with the green transition?With increasing inflationary pressures, households are looking for ways to cut down on expenditures, including on utility bills. Switching to more energy-saving appliances would require investments in new ones. What help can the Ministry provide to households to be more energy-efficient and save on their electricity bills? We have over 290,000 small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Singapore, employing two thirds of our workforce and contributing to half of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Collectively, our SMEs have a major impact. Any effort to reach our net-zero greenhouse gas emission target must surely require their active involvement. But SMEs have limited resources. What has the Ministry been and is doing to help SMEs become more energy-efficient?\n",

I would like to ask the Ministry for an update on the pilot disposable carrier bag charge scheme.Singaporeans are used to collecting and using such plastic bags for the disposal of trash and waste. How do we balance the need to cut down on plastic bags and the need to contain trash? How is the response so far for the collection of e-waste and recyclables via the big blue bins in our housing estates? Has the problem of contamination of the bins been reduced? How can the Ministry encourage more responsible usage of these bins?The Chairman: Mr Louis Ng, please take your three cuts together.\n",

      "Chairman, according to the data from Singapore Department of Statistics and the Energy Market Authority (EMA), our household electricity consumption in Singapore rose nearly 33% from 6.6 gigawatt hours in 2012 to 8.2 gigawatt hours in 2021.Households account for about 15% of total electricity consumption, with public housing accounting for 60% and private residential accounting for 40%. For each household, the main uses of electricity are in three categories: environmental control, 49%; household appliances, 45%; and personal devices, 6%.The Government has been advocating the use of more energy-efficient air conditioners, lighting and household appliances with energy efficiency ratings so consumers can be better informed. What accounts for the 33% increase in electricity of Singapore households over the last 10 years? What more can the Ministry do now to help Singapore households manage their electricity consumption? What is the targeted electricity consumption by each Singapore household that the Ministry hopes to achieve and how is this target communicated to the public?Our Public Service and commercial industries are major consumers of the remaining 85%. What is the Ministry now doing to make them more energy-efficient and reduce electricity consumption?\n",

      "Sir, Singapore has over the years been shoring up our coastal areas against rising sea levels and the onslaught of stronger waves pounding on our shores.We have built walls and stone embankments covering 70% to 80% of our coastline. We have seen local institutions working together to research on coastal protection measures, using mangroves and other sea grasses as natural barriers to provide protection from the effects of climate change. We have several beautiful beach parks from Changi to East Coast and West Coast, from Pasir Ris to Sembawang, not to mention many more offshore islands. I will just pick one area, that is the East Coast Park, which has seen many efforts being put in place to stem the erosion of the sandbanks and wave breakers.The average sea level around Singapore is projected to rise by up to one metre in about 80 years' time. As studies show, sea levels could rise up to four to five metres, if we take into account other effects: (a) the mean sea level rise of one metre phenomenal as well as daily tidal activities occurring twice a day; (b) storm surges where on average Singapore experiences two to four each year; as well as (c) land subsidence due to tectonic movements. So, we have very good reasons to be concerned about rising sea levels. Can the Minister update us on our progress to safeguard Singapore against the threat of rising sea levels and also the effort in coastal protection? This will also provide great opportunities to reimagine, reshape our coastlines and, at the same time, integrate amenities for human activities.Can the Ministry involve the public in the design of Singapore's coastal protection measures so that they have a sense of ownership in managing climate change as well as the design of our future beach parks?In my Budget debate speech, I have also urged the Government to bring forward the timeline to build the podders and seawalls that were announced by the Prime Minister during the 2019 National Day Rally. \n",

      "During the recent Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC's Green Action for Community's (GAC) deep dive session, one of the topics which was discussed among the GAC members is the concern for high contamination rates of recycling bins. Items containing food and liquid waste are frequently sighted being disposed of in recycling bins.Despite NEA's Recycle Right campaign, we still continue to see non-recyclable items such as used shoes and textiles found in these recycling bins. What other measures can the Ministry further introduce to reduce the contamination of recyclables in the blue bins?During the GAC's deep dive, green task force members from my Woodgrove division also shared with me that the issue of reducing household waste and successful recyclables are intertwined. In this regard, what are some of the efforts made by the Ministry to encourage households to reduce waste?The reduction of waste and contamination rates begin at home. Residents need to be equipped with the knowledge on what kinds of waste can be reduced, reused and recycled. While sorting is not required in Singapore as separation of materials is done at the materials recovery facilities, not doing so increases the likelihood of recyclables being contaminated.Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) like Tzu Chi Foundation has set a good standard for us to follow.By setting up active recycling points, residents will be more empowered to take matters into their own hands, putting in the effort to segregate all waste materials.Can the Ministry explore how we can eventually do away with one physical recycle bin but adopt methods practised in countries such as Japan by setting up more active recycling points and allowing a certain day of the week to be set aside as the recycling collection day when residents can place their segregated items for recycling?\n",

Could MSE share how can the public, including youths, be involved in the design of Singapore's coastal protection measures, including nature-based solutions?Beyond public consultations for the design of coastal protection measures, how else does MSE engage with the people sector to empower individuals to take action towards our overall environmental goals, including, for example, on marine litter.\n",

We need more of such ground-up initiatives led by and in the community.I would like to ask, does the Ministry track how community-led projects supported by the SG Eco Fund help us achieve our climate targets and  goals? What are the support and resources provided to such groups to plan and implement sustainability initiatives in the community as well as evaluate such projects? Does the Government have any plans to engage youths to encourage more ground-up sustainability initiatives and personal responsibilities in the green space beyond the classroom for the longer term, beyond ad-hoc one-off activities?\n",

      "Mr Chairman, Sir, being a small city-state, Singapore is not shielded from the impact of climate change. The average temperature has increased, rainfall has become more unpredictable and intense in recent years. Singapore will remain more vulnerable to worsening climate changes. As a low-lying island with 30% of our island being less than five metres above the Singapore Height Datum which is used as a reference for height measurement, rising sea levels pose the most immediate threat to us.If we take into account the compounding effects of mean sea level rise of one metre by 2100 as projected by PUB, sea levels could potentially go up by four to five metres if we include other activities such as storm surges and land subsidence.  The Government has taken the lead in advocating for a climate-resilient Singapore with adaptation efforts, one including protecting Singapore from sea level rise.I would like to raise the following questions. First, with the proposed plans of raising platforms for new critical infrastructure to be at least five to 5.5 metres above the mean sea level, how often will this measurement be reviewed by MSE? Given that there can be drastic climate effects in a short period of time, what are the plans to ensure that infrastructure planning is capable to meet with these changes? Second, MSE's publicly available information shared about the development of engineering projects for coastal protection measures.What would be the scope in engineering solutions and the timeline that MSE is looking at? In addition, will MSE work with relevant Ministries on creating new job opportunities and local business capabilities for these projects? Lastly, our national agenda on building a climate-resilient nation requires a strategic financial plan to ensure that monetary resources are well spent on long-term benefits. Therefore, how will these infrastructure-related project costs be financed?\n",

      "Mr Chairman, oil and gas prices have been on a rollercoaster for more than 10 years. The COVID-19 demand crash, followed by the supply collapse caused by the Ukrainian war, plunged the world into an energy crisis which threatened countries with blackouts and freezing winters. Given the inherent volatility in energy production, supply and trading today, it is reassuring to hear our long-term plans to accelerate solar deployment, work with regional partners to develop regional power grids, import low-carbon electricity by 2035 and explore new alternative sources of energy. It is encouraging that our National Hydrogen Strategy anticipates that hydrogen could supply up to half of power needs by 2050.However, the ordinary Singaporean and company would be equally concerned with the shorter-term affordability of electricity. An update on the status and timelines of the consultation to enhance the regulatory regime for electricity retailers would be helpful. How will Singapore safeguard our energy security and advance our energy transition despite our physical constraints and at the same time, balance the green transition? How are we preparing to deal with increased volatility in the global energy markets?\n",

      "Thank you, Mr Chairman. I would like to ask the Ministry two or three clarification questions, if I can, Chairman.The first is in regard to the Green Skills Committee that the Minister mentioned earlier. How is it different from the Jobs-Skills Integrator? Is it working in tandem? I think what would be interesting would be to note what age groups will be impacted, whether they will benefit from this as well? Because I think Minister of State Alvin Tan mentioned that there are 850 internships for ITE students. So, the question is whether there will be ITE absorption into the manufacturing sector and also into the green sector.My second question is in regard to Minister Tan's answer. I think he elaborated about the green transition, the carbon transition, the energy transition. My question is going forward, beyond this Budget, will there be any additional spending on physical infrastructure needed for the energy transition as Singapore prepares to absorb some of this solar and other alternative energy inputs coming to Singapore going forward? What is our strategy on that front and our spending needs?\n",

      "I mentioned during the Budget debate that I am glad that the Government continues to encourage SMEs to look towards the longer term to transform and capture opportunities in the new economy, even as they are focused on overcoming near-term challenges.A key thrust I raised was about helping our SMEs develop Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) capabilities. SMEs must adopt greener practices in their service and products, as well as measure, track and report their own carbon footprint. Such measurement is not easy to do but is essential to stay relevant in tomorrow's green supply chain.Beyond internal transformation, SMEs should venture out to pursue green prospects. For example, countries in the region are boosting electric vehicle (EV) initiatives. This means opportunities for Singapore SMEs with capital and know-how. to help fellow businesses in the region to accelerate their green transition. As transformation requires not just a push factor like carbon tax, can MTI further explain the pull factors that will be put in place to encourage and help SMEs in their green transition so that they can stay relevant and capture opportunities in the green economy?I am glad that existing schemes, such as the Energy Efficiency Grant for the food and retail sectors, are retained. Nonetheless, while these two sectors presumably consume more energy, I hope more SMEs across sectors can be included as all local businesses should be brought onto the green journey. The reality is that SMEs, especially smaller ones, may not know how or where to start.On this note, can MTI consider expanding the scope of current schemes and grants to spur our SMEs in more sectors?In a nascent and growing market where standards have yet to achieve global consensus, there are opportunities for Singapore and our businesses to lead in the development of a credible regulatory framework and standards for carbon credits. These efforts will help establish Singapore as a growing and leading green hub, leveraging on and furthering our status as a trusted international centre for professional services.To this end, can MTI share more on how businesses, including SMEs and the service sector, can play an expanded role, as part of plans to establish Singapore as an international green hub? – Opportunities and Risks\n",

      "Mr Chairman, Singapore is a small country with limited natural resources. Our energy needs are mostly imported, with few options for renewable energy. Most of Singapore's energy is generated by natural gas. Lowering our carbon emissions while ensuring our energy security and reliability is a challenge. In Budget 2023, Deputy Prime Minister Wong shared that Singapore is working towards the transition to solar energy and cleaner energy sources. He also mentioned working with our neighbours to develop regional power grids.It is important for our transition to alternative sources of energy to be a gradual one. Our current sources of renewable energy are not sufficient to support all households and businesses. Even in resource-rich countries, the switch to renewable energy is not immediate and takes a few years. While more research is being conducted for more viable approaches to renewable energy, we will need to educate and prepare households and businesses for this switch to greener energy. For businesses in particular, the adoption of renewable energy options might incur greater operational costs. How is the Government investing to build Singapore's energy security to enable reliable and affordable sources of energy for businesses in line with our economic goals and environmental needs? and Transition\n",

      "Mr Chairman, to achieve our target of net zero emissions by 2050 will require all in Singapore to work together.Businesses are important stakeholders in our green transition. To make the transition will involve adoption of innovative measures and technology for businesses to be more sustainable and efficient. Often, this means that businesses will have to incur more costs. However, businesses are already facing increasing costs of operations and labour. In 2022, and now in 2023, the unit business cost in manufacturing and service sectors rose by 9.6% and 8.8% respectively. It is projected that these costs will continue to increase in 2023.As we work towards decarbonisation, what are the Government's key measures to support businesses in the green transition? How will the Government make it viable for businesses to embark on sustainability initiatives to reduce cost? What support can be given to businesses to address current business costs pressures as they make the investments for the transition?Being able to report their carbon emissions will increasingly become a requirement for doing business in many countries as well as with larger companies. SMEs may struggle to account for and report their carbon emissions if they are unable to deal with such costs. Does the Government have plans to support SMEs in their sustainability reporting?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Chairman, over the past year, Singapore has clearly stepped up in its green ambition.We have committed to net-zero emissions by 2050 and passed the Carbon Price (Amendment) Bill in this House. We will raise carbon tax from $5 per tonne of emissions to $50 to $80 by 2030 to provide an economy-wide price signal to reduce emissions. The public sector has also stepped up and made the commitment to reach net-zero carbon emissions five years earlier, by 2045.These decisive commitments made in last 12 months should now translate to decisive actions.We have seen sustainability efforts gather pace across Government agencies as well as large corporations. However, the picture is mixed with SMEs. According to UOB's SME Outlook Study in 2022, whilst three in five of Singapore's SMEs believe in the importance of incorporating sustainability practices, they face challenges in implementation.Sir, the net-zero goal will increasingly become a prerequisite in the expectations of customers, investors as well as regulators across the world. It is urgent that we support our SMEs to take action to stay competitive and relevant.Companies are increasingly subjected to tighter sustainability reporting and regulations, particularly those with trading partners such as the EU, which have placed higher standards. As more trading partners follow similar measures in meeting their own goals of net zero by 2050, our businesses will face growing pressures to adapt or face obsolescence.It is critical that the Government supports industry to achieve a better understanding of the impact of a low-carbon future on their business and help them with the know-how and innovations that are available to make the green transition.I would like to call on the Government to help them with four interventions: (a) promote sector-based sustainability road maps, frameworks and uniform standards to level up knowledge and understanding; (b) support our companies with pre-identified sector-based green solutions to fast-track adoption, including supporting them in test-bedding new ideas and experimenting with new technologies; (c) leverage the ecosystem to build scalable green capabilities and collaborations, including knowledge-sharing platforms; and (d) build a framework to help companies comply with reporting requirements and compliance practices that are required by their counter parties.Sir, making the green transition will incur substantial investments by these companies. I would like to ask the Minister what strategies will the Government adopt to help companies cope with higher business costs arising from investment in low-carbon equipment, using sustainable supplies and adopting green processes? They also need to make provisions for the carbon tax hike.Sir, the introduction of the new Enterprise Financing Scheme Green (EFS-Green) to support local firms with a range of financing needs is a great initiative. However, companies have pointed out that the financing terms, which are intended to fund green transition, actually do not go far enough to spur adoption.With the Government sharing up to 70% of the risk with partner financial institutions, I would like to ask the Minister what expectations have been laid down with participating financial institutions to provide preferential loan terms and interest rates under EFS-Green?Sir, addressing climate change requires both mitigation and adaptation.A Harvard Business Review report argued that whilst climate change mitigation efforts have been front and centre, more efforts must be dedicated to climate adaptation to help people, animals and plants survive because of the rising climate volatility.I would like to ask the Minister how much is the Government's effort towards climate adaptation to help companies evolve organisational practices and infrastructure to deal with the inevitable climate risks such as floods, droughts, heat waves?Equipping the Singaporean workforce to take on jobs in the green economy must be a key priority. As countries compete for green talents to meet Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) needs in the coming years, Singapore must both attract the best of sustainability as well as develop our own capabilities to nurture our pool of talent to take up green jobs.I would like to ask how many of such positions does the Government project to become available over the years? How can Singaporeans receive the necessary training and credentials to secure green jobs?\n",

      "Sir, the protracted energy crisis continues to be a major challenge for the world. Faced with the need to keep prices low, countries are stockpiling energy and going back to coal. If this continues, it will be a vicious cycle, putting the planet's net-zero transition in jeopardy.The notion that energy security has to be secured at the expense of energy transition is a false one. We need to address both in parallel. In Singapore, this dilemma is an existential one that could erode our competitive position in the world economy. Businesses are citing energy prices as one of the main drivers of business cost in Singapore. At the same time, other geographies are luring industrial investments with cheap energy price, and luring clean energy investments by providing very attractive tax credits for producing clean energy. Despite our challenges, Singapore has committed to drive energy efficiency and to decarbonise. But because 40% of our overall emissions comes from the power sector, decarbonising the power sector therefore has to be an even more urgent priority. For example, we have put solar panels all over many of our HDB blocks.Can I ask the Minister how many of the solar panels are actually in operation today?Can the Minister also provide an update on Singapore's efforts to enhance our energy security and accelerate our energy transition, including driving energy efficiency, deployment of solar energy, development of emerging low carbon technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) and the import of renewable energy?\n",

      "Sir, to support our net-zero transition, and to turn the green economy into an engine of growth, we face a significant skills challenge. There is a high demand for talent to field green jobs and greening jobs, but there is a significant gap in supply. There is a need for a more urgent agenda in green skilling that addresses these gaps. Existing skilling efforts must be sharpened and accelerated. The green skilling agenda must address gaps in green technical skills including deep engineering skills and supply chain skills, and move from awareness building to application orientation. Can the Minister provide an update on how Singapore will develop the skills needed for a green economy in its workforce?\n",

      "Mr Chairman, decarbonisation is a generation defining business opportunities and our Singaporean companies are well-positioned to lead the way.According to the UOB SME Outlook Study 2022 Report, many SMEs understood the importance of sustainability. We need Enterprise Singapore to provide more assistance to SMEs so that they know how to measure emissions as many MNCs buyers have started to request their SME suppliers to furnish their carbon emission data.What are the quantifiable aims of the Enterprise Sustainability Programme (ESP)? How does Enterprise Singapore promote this ESP to the 290,000 SMEs in Singapore? I understood that many business consultants help to promote these Government schemes to the SMEs and assist these SMEs with the application of grants or reimbursements. These consultants' earnings are predicated on the loan amounts approved or amounts of grant received by the SMEs. If a particular scheme's approval process is lengthy or if there is no certainty that the grant can be approved after a huge amount of capital expenditure is incurred, the business consultants will only promote more straight-forward schemes, like Enterprise Financing Scheme, and not the ESP nor the Enterprise Innovation Scheme (EIS). I also hope that Enterprise Singapore can process the reimbursements according to the mini project milestones completed so that these SMEs' cash flow constraints can be alleviated.Lastly, how can more support be provided to the small accounting and auditing practices which provide sustainability accounting or assurance services to the SMEs?\n",

It also announced a transition framework to give existing emissions-intensive trade-exposed companies (EITE) more time to adjust to our new carbon tax policy, and to help maintain their business competitiveness.Can the Government elaborate on the efficiency standards and decarbonisation targets that EITE companies would have to meet to receive transitory allowances for part of their emissions?How long will these allowances be used for, and how will they affect the effectiveness of tourrevised carbon tax for incentivising decarbonisation?Singapore is building a robust green talent pipeline in Government, industry and academia, as part of the Singapore Green Plan 2030. Green jobs ensure Singapore's long-term economic resilience and provide important social values. However, business costs have been increasing due to persistent inflationary pressures and other economic challenges.What are the Government's efforts to increase the awareness and accessibility of sustainability-related information, knowledge base and opportunities to support our businesses and workforce in the green transition.

      "Chairman, I want to record my appreciation to all my fellow workers in the power and gas industry for their tireless efforts to keep and ensure our lights on and the gas keeps flowing for our homes and businesses at all times, with or without COVID-19. Our fellow workers regularly face brunt from the public whenever price hike is announced. When we, as workers, do not even have control over the price.As a General-Secretary of Union of Power and Gas Employees, in short UPAGE, we represent about 6,000 workers in this industry, ranging from technicians, technical officers, engineers, admin assistants, managers, and even chief executive officers (CEOs). Our strong tripartism model also involves having regular discussions with the Energy Market Authority (EMA) led by their CEO.Chairman, prior to today, my fellow members have been pestering me for any recognition or even monetary awards from the Government, just like our healthcare workers, for their efforts to ensure highly reliable electricity and gas supplies during the COVID-19 period. We all know our hospitals are equipped with many highly sophisticated machines and needs highly reliable electricity and gas supplies for them to operate efficiently. Have we ever imagined how it will turn out if we have power failure that would have failed the machines in hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic? Our workers also work round the clock but observed that we are hardly mentioned nor fairly rewarded. Hence, I am humbly appealing to the Minister to consider rewarding our workers for their efforts just as the Ministry of Health did for their healthcare workers earlier in November 2021.Our power and gas industry workforce is not as large as that in the healthcare industry. Hence, it would not burn a big hole in MTI's pockets to reward us. Chairman, the workers in this industry have gone through and overcome many changes and challenges together. Our next big thing is getting our fellow workers ready for new skill sets required for the new energy solutions. Calling and rallying workers to attend training is never an easy feat. In 2018, when SP Group embarked on Project Fusion, which meant future skills in everyone, my fellow union leaders and me, were given sarcastic remarks and bombarded by members and workers. We were labelled as pro-management. However, we believed in this project as it was meant to prepare our workforce for the job roles of tomorrow and the future.The training focuses on technological and technical fronts. With such focus, it will result in higher value-add jobs and meaningful careers leading to better wages, work prospects and welfare. Our leaders led by example and stepped forward earlier to attend the designated courses and progressively brought everyone on board.I am humble to share that we have succeeded in rallying 3,500 workers in acquiring new skills and achieved over 800,000 training hours. Amongst them, 200 workers have completed upskilling programmes and are applying their newly acquired skills in their new jobs. Importantly, management reciprocated by revising their wages after certain periods into their new job roles. We will not stop here but will continue to press on.Another example is City Energy, previously known as CityGas, who have decided to expand their business and move into new energy solutions, like green hydrogen and electric vehicles charging. In order to prepare for this transformation, both the union and the management formed company training committees, followed by rallying and re-energising their workers in order to develop a strategically adept and proficient workforce. UPAGE leaders will press on to advocate for our members' rights and long-term employability, in an efficient and a productive way. So, would the Minister for Trade and Industry who takes care of the energy industry, please do not disappoint us.\n",

      "I thank Mr Saktiandi for his clarifications. The Green Skills Committee (GSC), as the Minister has mentioned, will be set up by the second quarter of this year. How is it different from Jobs-Skills Integrators? Jobs-Skills Integrators will serve sectors which are a little bit more fragmented and less regulated, such as precision engineering, retail, wholesale, trade.The GSC is different in such that the focus will be on emerging green skills. These are in areas of green growth opportunities such as smart grid technology, even for workers that are graduating from Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) or ITEs, for example, in electric vehicle (EV) technology. Those are very emerging technologies.The committee will need to map this green skills development with a framework and a training roadmap and size the implementation and training needs as the economy grows in this regard.The GSC will focus first on two green skill areas, as the Minister mentioned. First is on sustainability reporting and assurance and the second is on energy. Let me just dive very quickly into these two.We are looking at skills on the first front – sustainability reporting, disclosures, advisory and compliance. So that is one sector, one first key area.The second is on energy. We know that and we envision that there will be a demand for skills associated with generation storage and deployment of renewable energy, for example, battery energy storage systems design, modelling and simulation and distributed energy resources management.So, sustainability reporting and assurance first because this is emerging and, of course, as infrastructure changes, energy as well.The Chairman: Mr Desmond Choo. Sorry, Minister Tan.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will answer the second question. I thank the Member for his clarification. To support our energy transition, there are a couple of initiatives that we are doing.One, obviously, is, as I have said in my speech, in terms of coming up with our energy market structure where we require the generation companies (gencos), in terms of the upgrading of CCGTs, to move to a more energy-efficient and lower emission, type of newer generation CCGTs. As a result of that we will request for proposals and interests. The change in terms of the markets, in terms of our regulation, allows us to plant that capacity, in the event that our existing gencos do not want to participate in it.If you talked about the kind of costing, at this particular point in time, given the fact that as a result of providing more market certainty to all of our gencos, we think that there is a higher chance of them participating in the RFP to build these new CCGTs.On the second part of it, in terms of our resilience, given the heightened uncertainties, the volatilities in the energy market, we need to also ramp up our capacity for standby facility. For instance, we have a standby LNG storage facility to ensure that we will not in any way be compromised if there are shortages in terms of the global supply chain.The third part is that we will also continue to invest in our grid development as well as energy storage systems and in terms of building interconnectors, when we import renewable energy from around the region.We will be providing more insights throughout the year in successive meetings. I hope that gives you a bit of a preamble as to what is to come.The Chairman: Mr Desmond Choo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you, Chairman. Just a quick question for the Minister. This is with respect to his comments on works that had been temporarily halted on Pedra Branca. Can I confirm with the Minister what is the timeline vis a vis Singapore's position on the monsoon season? When can we be expected to recommence work, precisely because the works are for the purposes of protecting against sea level rise and climate change? \n",
      "\n",
      "Chairman, as a small city-state, Singapore has thrived through many years of mutual exchange with many countries. We celebrated the 30th anniversary of the Singapore Cooperation Program (SCP) in 2022. Close to 150,000 foreign officials have participated in SCP courses, and a large proportion of participants were from ASEAN member states. Given the global fight against climate change and the impact of digitalisation in dealing with real world issues, there is increasing need for countries to cooperate and develop framework, conduct practices and co-create technical solutions that are beneficial for both their domestic needs and concurrently helping to solve global issues. While the commitment from countries is strong in wanting to reduce global emissions under the Paris Agreement, there needs to be demonstrated political will to set up intersectoral climate governance on critical areas like renewable energy transition, food security, forest and land use protection amongst others. I note that MFA has launched the Sustainability Action Package to support the capacity-building needs of developing countries on sustainability and climate change.Moving forward, I would like to ask the Minister how is SCP evolving to better meet regional and global challenges? Will SCP be advocating for an overarching coordinating body on climate change to ensure more information-sharing across ASEAN bodies, one that can convene dialogue partners to exchange based on structural needs and solutions and also engage civil societies; something similar to the public health emergencies model established during the pandemic? \n",
      "\n",
      "Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head U of the Estimates be reduced by $100\".The 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27) held in Egypt last year was set against challenging global geopolitical and economic conditions. Despite this, countries were able to deliver a package of decisions that reaffirmed their commitment to limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change and increase support for finance, technology and capacity building for developing countries.Can the Minister share the significance of COP27 for Singapore, the Singapore delegation's contributions to the conference and expectations for COP28 to be held in the United Arab Emirates later this year?Question proposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rising sea levels pose an existential threat to an island nation like ours. We must do our utmost to contribute to global efforts to combat climate change. On the other hand, we have very limited natural resources to generate green energy and rely heavily on traditional energy sources to keep the lights on and even to produce NEWater.How can we balance the needs of our economy to protect livelihoods and to mitigate climate change and the rising sea level threat? What factors did the Government take into consideration when it raised our climate targets to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050? How was the decision reached to reduce emissions to around 60 MTCO2 in our revised 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)?These are ambitious goals, considering that we are a high-density city state and international hub operating one of the busiest seaports and airports in the world. Our value-added manufacturing, particularly in the chemicals, electronics and precision engineering sectors, our financial services sector, the information and communications industries are all energy intensive. Hence, I would like to ask how confident is the Government of achieving our climate targets while maintaining economic growth? How will we manage the green transition and enforce compliance? What are the Government's key strategies and policies that will help Singapore peak emissions earlier and reach net-zero emissions by 2050?I am concerned about the impact on our small and medium enterprises. Would the Government provide an update on the measures to reach out to our SMEs and guide them in their journey to transform their operations and reduce carbon emissions?The Chairman: Mr Louis Ng. You can take your two cuts together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir, I welcome the commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. I also commend our revised 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution, which was submitted after a public consultation. I also thank the many activists and individuals on the ground who have worked tirelessly over many years for Singapore to be more ambitious on our climate goals. In my speech last year, I shared the stories of Esther from CDL, Lastrina, Cheryl and Swati from SYCA, Xiang Tian from LepakinSG and Wei-Shan from YP. There are many others fighting alongside them. They hold us accountable to our promises to future generations. Net-zero emissions by 2050 is an important but not an easy goal. The public sector has committed to taking the lead of achieving net-zero emissions around 2045. Can the Government share how it intends for the public sector to achieve net-zero emissions by 2045 and for the nation to reach the goal of net zero by 2050?Achieving net zero by 2050 has to be a whole-of-nation effort involving the Government, civil society, businesses and individuals. In 2021, the industrial sector and energy sector collectively contributed to 88% of Singapore's greenhouse gas emissions. While we encourage individuals to adopt low-carbon practices, efforts directed at the industrial and energy sectors will have the most impact on our nation's carbon emissions. Additionally, transitioning to a green industry will create more jobs. Can the Government share how it will move away from emissions-intensive industries? Will the Government provide a roadmap for the nation in achieving net-zero emissions by ensuring that all 23 industry transformation maps are reviewed with the goal of net zero by 2050?s\n",
      "\n",
      "Chairman, our Singapore Green Plan 2030 was launched in 2021. There is no lack of publicity about our efforts to achieve net-zero emissions and we have invested in various infrastructure projects such as electric vehicle (EV) charging points, the use of EVs, promoting green buildings and offering grants for energy efficient technologies, among others. These were commendable efforts and we have thus far kept up with the momentum, although it was eclipsed shortly by the outbreak of COVID-19.Today, we have learned how because of high energy prices, some countries have taken a step back to using coal to supplement their use of fossil fuels. But there are also countries that stepped up their effort in moving forward to use clean energy and invested heavily in wind, solar and others.In fact, nearly half of the world's low-carbon spending took place in China last year, according to one research.Every one of us has a part to play in our Green Plan 2030. I would like to ask what is the Government doing to help individuals, households and businesses to play their part in the Singapore Green Plan and the transition to a greener, more sustainable economy? What Government support is there to help in this transition? From the individual's perspective, how will the Government ensure there are good jobs and good growth opportunities for Singaporeans amidst this Green transition from a little red dot to a little green dot?\n",
      "\n",
      "Chairman, as we transition to become a green economy, new jobs and business opportunities will be created in almost every sector, ranging from engineering to finance, manufacturing to trade, services to construction.At the same time, certain jobs and businesses will become obsolete. Workers and staff who are unable to adapt will risk unemployment. Traditional enterprises that fail will affect livelihoods and invested capital and funds.How will the Government support workers who will be affected by the green transition? Will the Government share an update on the training and education measures to facilitate the preparation of workers for good jobs and career paths in this nascent sector? What initiatives are available to promote and support green businesses to encourage Singaporeans to explore such new opportunities?Mr Chairman: Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you, Mr Chairman.I speak as Chairman of our Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change (IMCCC). The IMCCC works very closely with the various ministries, and the ministries, in turn, work very closely with the sectors that they are responsible for, and in particular, we work very closely with Minister Grace Fu and the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE).Today I will give a broad overview and each of the Ministries will elaborate, in detail, on the plans that they have specifically.Reducing global greenhouse gas emissions is urgent. The Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change's Sixth Assessment Report warns that after 2030, it will become increasingly difficult to limit global warming to 2°C and we will face heightened and more complex climate risks.At COP26 in Glasgow, countries pledged to act. But recent conditions have made it more difficult to stay the course. Russia's invasion of Ukraine, exactly a year ago, disrupted energy and food supplies, causing energy and food prices to increase in many countries.Despite these external challenges, Singapore decisively stepped up our efforts against climate change last year. In Budget 2022, we announced Singapore's intention to raise our climate ambition. In October, after several months of public consultation, we formally revised our climate targets. We will reduce our emissions to around 60 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2030, after peaking our emissions earlier. We also committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.Ms Poh Li San asked about the considerations for raising our ambition – after all, we also are affected by external events and Singapore, as a small, alternative energy disadvantaged city-state, faces natural limitations on our climate action measures.Mr Chairman, first, climate change is an existential threat for us here in Singapore. As a low-lying island, we are vulnerable to rising sea levels. Being densely built-up, we are prone to trapping heat in our urban environment. Climate change poses risks to our biodiversity, food and water security, and public health.To mitigate climate change effects on Singapore, we must engage other countries to reduce their emissions worldwide. We must do our best and do our part, so that we can shape international norms to bring us closer to our collective goals.Finally, putting our climate ambition into action positions Singapore as a choice location for businesses and investors interested in participating in the regional green economy. This puts us in good stead to capture new economic opportunities in the climate transition.Ms Poh Li San, Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Mr Louis Ng asked how we will meet our climate targets. The Government, through IMCCC, strikes a balance between ambition and practicality of action. And it will take a whole-of-nation effort. The Green Plan sets out how the Government, businesses and the community can work together towards a greener future.The public sector will set the example by aiming to achieve net-zero emissions around 2045, five years ahead of our national target of 2050. This year, we will enhance our public procurement strategy and start making regular progress reports on public sector sustainability initiatives. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) and MSE will provide further details to this House.We will also continue to forge international collaborations on climate action. Prof Koh Lian Pin asked about the significance of COP27 and COP28. Let me share two positive examples of how Singapore contributed and made a difference.At both COP26 and COP27, Minister Grace Fu co-facilitated negotiations on Article 6. The Article 6 rulebook enables cross-border cooperation through carbon markets, for countries to jointly fulfil their national climate targets, making it more efficient and easier for countries to reduce their climate emissions and on a global level.The inaugural Singapore Pavilion at COP27 showcased our homegrown companies, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), youths and academics, including Prof Koh, to the international community. For instance, Sembcorp Industries launched its carbon management platform, GoNetZero. And one of GoNetZero's partnerships, with OCBC Bank, encourages clean energy adoption and decarbonisation, starting with Singaporean companies and scaling up to the region. Overall, COP27 advanced workstreams to support the implementation of the Paris Agreement. And we will press on at COP28.Mr Chairman, government action is necessary but not sufficient to achieve a low-carbon future. Businesses need to act as well, and we will partner them in their sustainability journeys. The industry sector contributes over 60% of our overall carbon emissions. So, to reach net zero by 2050, we must decarbonise at every level – the economy, each sector and individual firms – so that our businesses are ready to thrive in the green economy.Our carbon tax shapes economy-wide behaviour. The Government has specified carbon tax levels up to 2027 and a range of $50 to $80 per tonne of CO2 by 2030. All of us must now factor in the cost of emitting carbon. And now that the carbon tax levels are known, companies can also plan with greater predictability.This will make greener modes of production, investment and living more desirable. The carbon tax collected will continue to support businesses and households. We will invest in green technologies and infrastructure, extend energy efficiency grants to businesses, and cushion our lower- and middle-income households from the impact of the carbon tax on electricity prices with U-Save rebates.The Government will enable the energy transition by securing greener sources of energy. Our National Hydrogen Strategy lays out the roadmap for the use of hydrogen which, with technological advancements, could potentially supply up to half of our power needs by 2050. In the meantime, we continue to see how we can import green electrons.Mr Louis Ng asked about support for industry. Aside from economy-wide moves, such as carbon tax and decarbonising our grid, we will also help sectors reorient towards greener production and develop competitive advantages in growth sectors.As a financial hub, Singapore has a head start in green financing services. Our industry sectoral roadmaps consolidate common challenges, allowing scale-up of promising initiatives and guide companies in positioning themselves to capture opportunities. The Ministry of Transport (MOT) and Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) will update this House on the sustainability plans for the transport and tourism sectors respectively.Every business, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), must be financially and environmentally sustainable in order to thrive in the long run, by decarbonising their value chains and accelerating their green transition. MTI will report on how we are helping SMEs to level up in areas, such as sustainability reporting and carbon accounting.Small companies can drive sustainability efforts across their supply chains. One example is DTC World, a local SME specialising in corporate gifts. It champions sustainable procurement and promotes sustainable consumption and it has received multiple corporate sustainability awards. So, SMEs also can do their part.Finally, Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked how the Government ensures that opportunities and good jobs for Singaporeans will be there amid the green transition. Many Singaporeans are passionate about sustainability – not many more than Mr Louis Ng. We will support you in challenging your passion towards making an impact.For Singaporeans who may not yet have internalised climate change, understanding the implications of climate change on the environment and our society is the first step. The Ministry of Education (MOE) will elaborate on how we will nurture our young to become eco-stewards and live sustainably, with a focus on food sustainability in 2023.We will also support Singaporeans to acquire green skills and improve their access to green job opportunities. MTI will describe how we will do so with industry players and training partners.Mr Chairman, Sir, global climate action is urgent. All countries, including Singapore, must honour our shared responsibility for our planet earth. The IMCCC takes a whole-of-nation view to make sure our efforts are comprehensive and coordinated. Businesses, communities and individuals have a key part to play.The climate transition will be challenging, but it will be a rewarding journey, with opportunities for us to innovate and reimagine a greener and more sustainable future. So, let us work together, towards a better and greener Singapore.The Chairman: Ms Mariam Jaafar.\n",
