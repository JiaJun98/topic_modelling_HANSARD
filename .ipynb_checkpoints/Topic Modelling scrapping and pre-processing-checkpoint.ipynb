      "Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok): Mr Chairman, Sir, I beg leave to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head P of the Estimates be reduced by $100\".\n",
      "On 18 February 2023, the Operation Lionheart contingent of SCDF, comprising 68 officers, which included two Full-time National Servicemen doctors, and four canines returned home after being deployed in TÃ¼rkiye for search and rescue operations. This followed the devastating earthquake that has to-date killed more than 50,000 people in the region.  \n",
      "Our officers under the command of Col Chew Keng Tok, were activated to fly to TÃ¼rkiye at short notice. There for 10 days, they operated in very difficult conditions. They had to contend with freezing temperatures, the ever-present threat of further collapse of buildings and the calamitous security situation. In fact, rescue officers from several other countries suspended their operations owing to the prevailing security situation. Despite these challenges, our officers persisted. They saved lives, comforted many and brought honour to our country.  \n",
      " That our officers were able to execute their duties in such a way as to win the admiration of the Turkish people is a testimony to their sterling standard of training and preparedness, strong sense of duty and purpose, excellent leadership and high morale.  \n",
      "Sir, I am sure all hon Members of this House will join me thanking our SCDF officers as well as that of their family members for their courage, and their spirit of sacrifice, in the name of our country. [Applause.]\n",
      "From the reports that I have read, I note that our SCDF officers' work was enabled by the technology of our Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) equipment such as fibre-optic scopes to detect lives.  \n",
      "It is clear to me that technology has and will continue to play an increasingly important role in securing better outcomes in operations. There are a number of factors that drive this including the reality that our Home Team's manpower is likely to remain lean and the likelihood that our Singaporeans will constantly expect more of the Home Team over time. We must, in short, do more with less.  \n",
      "Over the years, the Home Team has invested heavily on technology. For instance, ICA officers leverage on video analytics and live tracking technology to maintain security at the Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints. The Singapore Prison Service is trialling an unmanned and automated urine collection and screening system for its prison inmates.\n",
      " Whilst it is correct that we in the House support the Home Team's investment in technology to achieve operational efficiencies, we also need to be able to gauge the effectiveness of investments. I therefore wish to ask the hon Minister the following questions: \n",
      " How much has the Home Team invested in technological solutions in the past five years? What has been the tangible returns from these investments? What lessons have been drawn? And what would be the framework under which further investments will be made?  \n",
      "I also wish to understand how the Home Team Science and Technology Agency, set up in 2019, has aided the development of cost-effective science and technological capabilities for our Home Team operations. \n",
      "In addition, I wish to better understand how the Police's effectiveness is being measured. \n",
      "Several decades back, the Police relied on the prevalence of the five preventable crimes as a measure of its effectiveness.  \n",
      "Over time, these KPIs became less relevant with the emergence of new kinds of crime such as internet-based scams.  \n",
      "I had previously suggested that the Police publish how much it has seized pursuant to criminal investigations and how much is returned to victims of crime as a KPI. This is done in the UK.\n",
      "The hon Minister informed that his Ministry does not track such data. I seek a review, as just a few days ago, the hon Minister of State announced in this House that over a five-month period in 2022, virtual assets amounting to $172.8 million were seized. Hence, it appears to me that there is an ability to track such data.\n",
      "As I alluded to in my preceding paragraphs, even as I speak about the need for technology, I also see that there remains an irreducible human dimension in keeping Singapore safe and secure. We must ensure that our investment in developing our Home Team's human capital is kept in tandem too. What is the hon Minister's plan in this regard?  \n",
      "I now turn to Singapore's security situation. It seems to me, by reference to the increasing number of recent cases of young persons being self-radicalised through access to harmful online content, that there is a case to take a relook at the legislative levers to ensure that our Home Team officers, particularly the Internal Security Department (ISD) have the tools to prevent the proliferation of such cases. Otherwise, the impact on Singapore can be significant and severe.  \n",
      "We should remind ourselves that terrorists need only be successful once. ISD, on the other hand, has to be successful all the time. In 2022, it was announced in this House that the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) will develop a framework that will tackle online criminal activity, including content inciting violence in our community, to complement the current legislative measures. I seek an update on this matter, please.  \n",
      "Let me now turn to the situation in our prisons. I commend the Singapore Prison Services (SPS) for spearheading efforts with its stakeholders to keep the recividism rate amongst desisters relatively low and stable. The five-year recividism rate of 39.9%, which I believe is being released for the first time this year, is an encouraging statistic even though there is a slight increase in the two-year recividism rate by 0.4% to 20.4%.  \n",
      "I was glad to note that the Government has announced in Budget 2023 the Uplifting Employment Credit (UEC) for companies to employ desisters. This was something I pushed for in this House when I suggested that the Jobs Growth Incentive for ex-offenders to help them during the COVID-19 pandemic be turned into a permanent scheme.  \n",
      "I think, from the experience of the JGI and the steps taken by SPS, we have an opportunity to aim for even lower recividism rates.  \n",
      "The Government's UEC creates an important incentive for employers to seriously consider investing in our desisters. In turn, by gainfully employed in good jobs that have good prospects, it gives our desisters the best chance to break free from their past.  \n",
      "To effect permanent changes, we have to start with the individual and work with their families too. This will not be easy but has to be done. I understand that SPS has, over the years, built a substantial number of volunteers who are roped in to help with reintegration support for prison inmates and desisters. I believe that there is a case for SPS and its volunteers to partner the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), Ministry of National Development (MND) and other Government agencies to co-create bespoke plans for each desister that has a series of incentives and disincentives during the supervision period of desisters. The purpose is to motivate desisters to be responsible family members and encourage reconciliation within their families. I truly believe that once our desisters are accepted back and reconciled with their families, the sky will be the limit for them.  \n",
      " As a broader point, our community must play its part to encourage our desisters to make strong contributions to their families and enrich the Singapore's story. They have talent, knowledge and experience which Singapore can benefit from. We need to get behind them and signal to them that we will support them so long as they keep on the path of rehabilitation and reintegration. Early last year, I suggested in this House that our desisters be given an opportunity to perform at our National Day Parade. Having seen them perform, I know that they will be a hit amongst Singaporeans. I understood that my suggestion was made too late for National Day Parade (NDP) 2022. I wonder whether it was in time for NDP 2023 instead.  \n",
      "May I ask what strategies SPS will employ to leverage on the UEC, to help desisters overcome real-life challenges and lead crime-free lives? What is the permanent employment rate amongst our desisters? What would be the realistic stretch target for us to achieve in the years to come?  \n",
      "We also need to pay special attention to desisters with drug-abusing pasts. I understand that this is the group of persons who are more likely to re-offend as they struggle to steer clear from triggers that make them consume drugs in the first place. May I ask what new measures, if any, that SPS and the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) are proposing to deal with this admittedly intractable issue?  \n",
      "Mr Chairman, Sir, I have spoken on what I see to be the three elements of securing Singapore for the future. Courage is beyond price, but technology and developing the talents of our men and women in the Home Team, these require constant investments and our continued support. I look forward to hearing from the Minister and her colleagues on the issues that I have raised.\n",
      "Question proposed. \n",
      "New Citizen Selection Criteria\n",
      "Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied): Chairman, new citizens are going to be even more important to the future of Singapore. With our total fertility rate at the historical low of 1.05, it will not be hyperbole to say new citizens are a critical pillar in the shape of any future Singapore. \n",
      "In line with the Government's Forward Singapore exercise that promises a renewed social compact with citizens, we need to ask what should Singapore's goals be when bringing in new citizens? \n",
      "We want those who truly know Singapore and want to embrace the Singapore way of life. We want those who really want to live here and be here. We want people who have already proven themselves by having integrated into Singapore life after some time as Permanent Residents.\n",
      "Singaporeans do not want new citizens who do not want to live here but only want the power of the Singapore passport for their convenience and the safe and secure environment for their assets and wealth. We do not want new citizens who are reluctant for their sons to do National Service and, certainly, none of us want people who only want Singapore Citizenship as a stepping-stone to another country but, instead, seek those who have a long-term commitment to Singapore.\n",
      "Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong has promised that Forward Singapore will move on to looking at solutions.\n",
      "The Swiss, for example, have a highly specific selection process for new citizens. People must show deep commitment before granted Swiss citizenship through naturalisation. Applicants must show themselves to be successfully integrated into Switzerland and know Swiss ways and customs. \n",
      "For ordinary naturalisation, a person must have lived in Switzerland for 10 years and hold a permanent residence permit. The Swiss Naturalisation Authorities summoned applicants for a personal interview which focuses on their knowledge of Switzerland. They must be able to answer questions on Swiss geography, history, politics and society.\n",
      "Do we have similar requirements? For example, the latest Singapore Census 2020 revealed that 48.3% of the resident population in Singapore spoke English most frequently at home compared to 32.3% a mere 10 years ago. Is the working proficiency in English a criterion for citizenship for better integration between new citizens and Singaporeans of all races and religion, since English is our main language of communication?\n",
      "Can the Government share more details on how new citizenships are granted as there are aspects of the process and criteria currently that are opaque? How is our system different from that of the Swiss? Is there already a point system in place and what does it consider apart from the publicly revealed criteria, such as economic contribution, educational qualification, family profile and length of stay in Singapore?\n",
      "Most importantly, how will the citizenship selection process evolve in face of the Forward Singapore exercise and a review of the social compact?\n",
      "Legislation for Online Criminal Activity\n",
      "Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang): Chairman, cybercrime is a broad area. The police have described the two categories as cyber-enabled offences and cyber dependent offences. Cyber dependent offences are those where digital assets are the target and include hacking, ransomware and website defacements. These of these offences are covered by the Computer Misuse Act.\n",
      "On the other hand, cyber-enabled crimes relate to crimes that are facilitated by the computer and include the wide range of scams, cyber-harassment, cyber-extortion and illegal online gambling. These are currently covered by different pieces of legislation, including the Penal Code and the Protection from Harassment Act.\n",
      "Both areas seem to have been growing. In relation to cyber dependent crimes, a total of 1.8 million web threats against Internet users were detected and blocked in Singapore between April and June 2022 according to data obtained from Kaspersky Security Network, and this was a 17.6% rise from the previous year.  \n",
      "On cyber-enabled crimes, The Straits Times reported that around $661 million was lost to online scams in 2022. While there are a wide range of tools that are needed to deal with such crimes, legislation is obviously an important component. Does MHA see any gaps in the existing legislative framework to deal with cybercrime?\n",
      "3.30 pm\n",
      "At the Committee of Supply debate in 2022, MHA mentioned that it was working on a framework to deal with a broad suite of online criminal activity. How will this framework relate to the existing legislation?\n",
      "The Chairman: Mr Christopher de Souza, both cuts please.\n",
      "Home Team Transformation â Technology\n",
      "Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah): Sir, as a result of technological advancements, the threat of crime is considerably more global than ever and certainly does not respect boundaries. We need to continually strengthen our technological capability so as to detect crime, including multi-jurisdictional crimes. What is the Home Team doing to leverage on technology to battle domestic and transnational crime and does this requires some degree of transformation of operations?\n",
      "Home Team Transformation â Manpower\n",
      "MHA fulfils a key function: the maintenance of order and law in Singapore. But with declining birth rates, manpower has been and will continue to be affected. Leveraging on technology, cooperation with MINDEF, partnerships with international organisations such as Interpol and good relationships with police forces in the region are key to making up for the reducing pool of local manpower.\n",
      "But in the round, manpower is still key. Ground, human judgement is key in ground ops and therefore how will MHA transform itself to ensure: one, that our officers continue to be world-class; and two, that our world-class officers work alongside best-in-class technology to assist in the fight against crime?\n",
      "Youth Radicalisation\n",
      "Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang): In Malay, Sir.\n",
      "(In Malay): [Please refer to Vernacular Speech.] We have seen more cases of youth radicalisation recently and they are getting younger. \n",
      "Just a few weeks ago, we were shocked with reports of two Singaporean teenagers being issued orders under ISA for terrorism-related activities. One of them, a 15-year old teenager, is the youngest person to be dealt with under ISA. The teenagers were contacts of another self-radicalised 18-year old, who was also detained by ISD last December.\n",
      "Although they were self-radicalised separately, they subsequently became acquainted online. The teenagers joined multiple extremist-themed servers on online gaming platform Roblox. Such online gaming platforms are being used by extremist groups to disseminate their ideological beliefs. They use video games and gaming culture to attract and influence our youths. We need to keep abreast of the technological developments and current societal trends to prevent terrorists from abusing such online platforms to spread extremist ideologies that prey on the minds of our youth.\n",
      "Can MHA provide an update on how it intends to tackle this trend?\n",
      "The Chairman: Mr Christopher de Souza. You can take your three cuts, please.\n",
      "Home Team Transformation â Anti-terror\n",
      "Mr Christopher de Souza: With the threat of self-radicalisation becoming more apparent in Singapore and around the region, stepping up our efforts in countering the threat of terrorism is key. We need to continually strengthen our regulatory framework and our detection capabilities so as to keep a close watch on potential terror situations or threats.\n",
      "How will MHA continue to partner with other states in our fight against terror, given the fight is not one that exists in vacuum? Further, how is the Home Team transforming its operational capabilities such as to prevent terrorist financing and to prevent money laundering in relation to terrorism?\n",
      "Fight Against Tolerance to Drugs\n",
      "Sir, Singapore has had a long and hard stance against drugs. It has benefited our nation. However, there is a gradually growing perception that drugs are less harmful or not harmful if used just socially. But it is obvious that experimental drug use can lead to addiction.\n",
      "How does MHA intend to reinvent and transform its engagements and messages regarding the growing tolerance to drugs? In particular, how will MHA explain that the liberalisation of recreational drug use in other countries, including some in the region, will in every likelihood lead to massive long-term societal harm? Such brutally honest messaging could achieve the deterrent effect needed to puncture the growing tolerance to drugs.\n",
      "The Battle Against the Lure of Cannabis\n",
      "Sir, Singapore is seeing a rise among younger members of society in terms of usage of cannabis. Youth form a significant proportion of new abusers of illicit drugs. We need to continue and readily impart drug-free values to the next generation and educate and inculcate the understanding that addiction is not without consequences. Families can be torn apart by addiction and what more, widespread addiction can lead to devastating consequences on our society as a whole.\n",
      "How does MHA intend to ramp up its engagement of our youths regarding the dangers of drug abuse, especially in the light of the growing and dangerous lure of cannabis?\n",
      "Prevention of Drug Abuse\n",
      "Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio): Chairman, I support our zero-tolerance stance against drugs. Unfortunately, as some other countries resort to legalising and decriminalising drugs, such a liberal attitude towards narcotics has been spreading through social media and other channels. This may have an impact on certain segments of our society including some youths. How will MHA proceed with its efforts to prevent drug abuse?\n",
      "Drug Offences Recidivism\n",
      "Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member): Sir, the Singapore Prison Service recently released statistics of the drug offences recidivism rates. Both the two-year recidivism rate at 26.1% and the five-year recidivism rate at 45.2%, were up. Separately, the consistently higher five-year rates point to the fact that over the longer term, the chances of re-offending are higher. This could be because former offenders are more likely to fall in with bad company and into their old ways once Government support tapers off.\n",
      "Yellow Ribbon Singapore (YRSG) looks at rebuilding the lives of former inmates and ex-offenders through skills and career development. There are excellent programmes like training even before an inmate is released and career coaching. Could the Minister elaborate on MHA and YRSG's plans in the coming year for programmes specifically targeting the two- to five-year period after an ex-offender for drug offences has been released? It appears from the statistics that this is an important period to have ongoing programmes.\n",
      "Furthermore, recidivism should be tackled not only through helping ex-offenders get jobs but through community support as well. I would like to ask whether the Ministry will consider expanding the role of YRSG to cover holistic rehabilitation of ex-offenders beyond skills and career development, and that will empower YRSG to also be somewhat of a coordinating body for all the various efforts by various Government bodies to tackle recidivism, including community efforts and long-term programmes up to and even beyond five years.\n",
      "YRSG held its second CARE Network Summit in 2022. Could I ask the Minister to elaborate on what outcomes from that summit will implemented by YRSG this year or that it is considering? How will community groups and employers be involved?\n",
      "I would also like to ask, Sir, how YRSG actively reaches out and provides support to families of offenders and ex-offenders, and could the Minister elaborate on YRSG's plans for this year in this area?\n",
      "Drug laws, Sir, has been liberalised in many countries, including neighbouring countries. Could I ask the Minister how would the Government ameliorate the effect of a stepped-up anti-drug campaign on ex-offenders such that we do not see a resurgence of stigmatisation?\n",
      "Recidivism and Reintegration\n",
      "Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim: Sir, Singapore's two-year recidivism rates are not only the lowest in the world but also our lowest in 30 years. As a Board Member of YRSG, I am proud of all the efforts made by the entire ecosystem of support from the Singapore Prison Service (SPS), MHA, community partners and employers to assist us in the reintegration effort.\n",
      "As mentioned in my Committee of Supply speech last year, we need \"offenders\" to become \"overcomers\" â overcoming the challenges in life in a whole-of-society approach. I welcome that SPS now use the term \"desistors\" which helps to remove the stigma of incarceration.\n",
      "While the numbers are good, we cannot rest on our laurels. We should tackle long-term recidivism rates on a five-year period horizon. How does MHA intend to further reduce the long-term recidivism rates of ex-offenders?\n",
      "The Chairman: Mr Christopher de Souza. Both cuts, please.\n",
      "Acceptance of Ex-offenders\n",
      "Mr Christopher de Souza: Sir, many former offenders find themselves to be the target of the invisible bars of prejudice and suspicion, making their process of rehabilitation and reintegration into society that much more challenging. By raising more awareness to accept former offenders as fellow and equal members of society, we can generate greater public support which could translate into a greater number of volunteers for the Community Action for the Rehabilitation of Ex-offenders (CARE) Network, the Yellow Ribbon Project and other aftercare programmes. How is MHA creating awareness and generating acceptance for our former offenders in order to facilitate their transition and welcoming back into society?\n",
      "Mentorship Programmes for Ex-offenders\n",
      "Sir, we must make a concerted effort to welcome former offenders into our society after their release. Such a welcoming attitude will also reduce the chance of re-offending and possibly even heal families. In the road to recovery and reintegration, mentorship is key. How can MHA and the Singapore Prison Service continue to enhance the provision of post-release mentorship schemes for our former offenders?\n",
      "Employability of Ex-offenders\n",
      "Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong): Chairman, I have met Clementi residents who are ex-offenders. Some were in prison for many years, and upon release find that the job market has changed from the days before. Some are older, having been in and out of incarceration and now are dealing with health conditions even as they are trying to find work. Finding work, finding a job â it is part of the recovery journey, the rehabilitation journey, rebuilding a life while coming back into society.\n",
      "What is MHA doing to improve the employability of ex-offenders who are rebuilding their lives and how are we recognising employers who are inclusive, employers who lean in to give someone that second chance in life?\n",
      "Yellow Ribbon and Criminal Records\n",
      "Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer): As part of our #EveryWorkerMatters conversation exercise last month, together with my NTUC colleagues and volunteers, I had the great opportunity to host a dialogue session at our NTUC premises for more than 100 employers, ex-offenders, Yellow Ribbon Singapore, Singapore Prison Service and New Charis Mission friends. This is the first time that NTUC and Labour Movement has engaged this community for a dialogue.\n",
      "On another occasion earlier this month, my team and I had an opportunity to engage a group of inmates at Changi Prison as part of our #EveryWorkerMatters conversation to share as well as hear their thoughts on jobs, training, skills and employment and employability in general.\n",
      "I applaud the work of Yellow Ribbon Singapore and Singapore Prison Service and for making our engagement possible so that we can hear first-hand from the community as we forge a new workers' compact.\n",
      "As much as it was happy to hear some employers leaning forward to help and hire ex-offenders, we hear the fears and anxieties from the inmates who are soon to be released and wanting to re-integrate back into society as well as find decent work when they are out.\n",
      "In this respect, I wish to make three points.\n",
      "First, I wish to know what is being done thus far and the plans of Singapore Prison Service and Yellow Ribbon Singapore in this important space to help in the employment and employability needs of ex-offenders.\n",
      "Second, I hope that MHA will consider reviewing the Registration of Criminals Act in the treatment and type of offences that are spent including the duration of the past offence before a criminal record is spent. This area has not been reviewed for a long time and I hope the review will be able to give ex-offenders a higher chance of employment and employability when they re-enter into the workforce and society.\n",
      "3.45 pm\n",
      "Third, taking off my interaction with the community, I suggest that MHA give more support for halfway houses and shelters specially catered for women, including those run by charities, NGOs and religious organisations.\n",
      "Collaboration with Malay/Muslim Community\n",
      "Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim: Sir, in Malay.\n",
      "(In Malay): [Please refer to Vernacular Speech.] The number of new Malay drug abusers arrested has decreased by 21% in 2022 compared to the previous year. In 2021, the number of Malay drug offenders arrested dropped by 15%; compared to other communities who declined by 7%. \n",
      "This statistic shows that efforts by CNB and our community, through the close cooperation of the Dadah Is Haram Campaign, M3 and other Malay/Muslim bodies, have yielded results.\n",
      "Our Malay/Muslim community has also greatly supported the Dadah Is Haram Campaign through a network of more than 70 mosques throughout Singapore and volunteers. Apart from that, the FITRAH program by M3 and our Malay/Muslim Organisations Rehabilitation Network have also helped to combat the scourge of drugs and its impact on our community.\n",
      "Chairman, therefore, I would like to ask what is MHA's plan to continue working with our Malay/Muslim community to help offenders and ex-offenders within our community?\n",
      "Regularising Security Officer Work Hours\n",
      "Mr Raj Joshua Thomas: Sir, security officer working hours in both private and Government contracts are typically 12-hours a day, six days a week. Such working hours are unreasonable and unsustainable.\n",
      "I would like to ask if the Government will take the lead to regularise working hours for security officers in Government security contracts, including to give more weightage at the evaluation stage of outcome-based security contracts, to tender bids that propose shorter working hours for security officers. Let us ensure that our security officers are not left behind in all this talk of work-life balance.\n",
      "The Chairman: Mr Derrick Goh. Not here. Mr Sitoh Yih Pin.\n",
      "The Threat of Scams\n",
      "Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir): Mr Chairman, the recent statistics that were released by the Police on scams released has surely captured our attention on the threat that scams are causing in the community. That the Police released this set of statistics separate and distinct from other crime numbers for the first time, shows that scams are fast becoming a major cause of concern.  \n",
      "The numbers are quite astounding. Year on year, the total amount reported to have been cheated from all scams rose from $632 million in 2021 to $660.7 million in 2022. The number of scams and cybercrime cases increased by about 25%, from 26,886 in 2021, to 33,669 in 2022. \n",
      "And for those of us who think that seniors are generally the vulnerable class in society that are more susceptible to being scammed, we know that the cases involving seniors only amount to 8.8% of all cases. A whopping 79.4% of cases involved individuals from the ages of 10 to 49 years of age.\n",
      "Anecdotally, I am sure all of us have heard of many stories of scams. As representatives in this House, we will also have met many residents who have sought our assistance when scammed. \n",
      "Not so long ago, I remember that the concern was mainly about phishing links, sent by emails, digital messages or on social media. Raising awareness on such modus operandi was easier. We warned one another not to click on links immediately, to always question and verify before proceeding.  \n",
      "Scams have evolved quite significantly since then. There are now scams that appear to be innocuous but end up being most insidious. Scammers masquerade as love interests, friends who have changed numbers and are in need of assistance or even promise what appeared to be legitimate jobs but end up cheating, oftentimes, life savings of individuals. Some scams even play the long game for many months, slowly cheating not only money, but also causing great emotional turmoil to its victims.     \n",
      "Perhaps, what is the most alarming about scams, is the fact that it is often the case that these scams originate from overseas and once money is transferred to another account, it promptly leaves our shores and jurisdiction almost instantaneously. This makes the task of the Police, no matter how well-trained and determined they are, all the more challenging in arresting scammers and especially in their efforts to retrieve the stolen monies for the victims.  \n",
      "Given the insidious threat of scams and the disproportionate harm it brings to its victims, I hope that the Government will take steps to augment its support of the Police, by legislation or otherwise, work with industry partners, such as our financial institutions and other stakeholders in the process to combat scams and protect the community.  \n",
      "In the premise, I invite the Minister to share with this House, the steps that the Government is taking to address the threat of scams in the community, whether the Ministry has plans to strengthen legislation to combat scams and the efforts that are being made to educate and keep the public informed of the latest developments so that Singaporeans can take the necessary precautions against scams.\n",
      "Support for Scam Victims\n",
      "Dr Shahira Abdullah (Nominated Member): Chairman, scam victims suffer more than just financial losses. It often takes a toll on them physically, mentally, and socially. Many may be too embarrassed to seek help. Victims feel anxiety, shame and helplessness, and a variety of other emotions which may lead to depression, tension and stress. The deep shame may also prevent these victims from seeking help. They may also engage in self-harm or turn suicidal.\n",
      "The Anti-Scam Centre was set up last year as a collaboration between Singapore Police Force (SPF) and six banks. Building on that, could I also suggest having a one-stop unit that collaborates with relevant agencies and professionals dedicated to assisting scam victims amid a scam or after they have fallen prey to the scam? This unit could ensure that vulnerable groups, such as the deaf, who may not be able to utilise the phone hotlines can get timely help. Post-scam, frontline officers from the Police or banks could refer victims to this \"Post-Scam\" Unit to better address their financial and mental needs promptly.\n",
      "Financially, the unit can assess the victim's financial needs, provide information about financial support services and refer the victim to relevant social service agencies. Emotionally, the Post-Scam Unit would be equipped to assess their mental health needs and provide immediate emotional support, if needed, to prevent further deterioration in their mental well-being. The unit can then refer the victim to follow-up mental health services and support groups.\n",
      "Finally, the unit can follow up with the victim after the initial report to check on their well-being and provide additional support if needed. They can also provide updates on the status of the investigation and any support services that may be available to the victim.\n",
      "The Chairman: Mr Christopher de Souza, you can take your four cuts, please.\n",
      "Online Scams â Shutting Mule Accounts\n",
      "Mr Christopher de Souza: Sir, money mule accounts are a serious issue and the impending changing the law is good. Laws need to be regularly reviewed to respond to the fast-evolving nature of the scams.\n",
      "There needs to be sufficient flexibility within the legislation and subsidiary legislation. People are being lured by easy money to sell their Singpass details and bank accounts for purposes, such as money laundering, facilitating unauthorised access to computer material and carrying out unlicensed businesses.\n",
      "How is MHA aiming to reduce the prevalence of money mule accounts and lower the incidence of people selling their personal details and bank accounts?\n",
      "Combatting Online Scams Using Technology\n",
      "Sir, scammers are getting increasingly diverse in the forms of scams that they are able to carry out with the use of new technology, AI and over the Internet. To build a strong digital infrastructure to prevent scams, we need to utilise technology, such as big data, to be able to spot common patterns, to highlight suspicious transactions and websites with scammers spoofing e-commerce platforms, fake friend call scams and impersonation scams.\n",
      "How is MHA using technology and partnering with various stakeholders to further flag out suspicious transactions for our digital infrastructure needs to develop to put up more barriers and warnings against phishing and other forms of data theft?\n",
      "Multi-pronged Way to Fight Online Scams\n",
      "Sir, a collective multi-pronged approach to fight scams is necessary, given the nature of online scans. This includes not just Government agencies and banks, but telcos customers and consumers and the community at large.\n",
      "How is the Government working in tandem with the various sectors in order to develop specific and targeted approaches to dealing with different sorts of scams particularly, because scams evolve quickly? What infrastructure is in place to respond to new forms of scams across the various industries, such that all stakeholders are informed and play their part in collectively combatting the threat?\n",
      "Raising Awareness to Deter Online Scams\n",
      "Sir, we need a strong public awareness regarding the nature of scams and the various forms they take.\n",
      "In recent years, there has been a proliferation of scams, including e-commerce scams, Internet love scams and investment scams. These scams are particularly difficult to track and counter because these deal with daily life and, to some extent, human sentiment and human emotion.\n",
      "Given how fast scams can evolve and new scams can appear, we need to be able to quickly inform the public, especially the targeted groups that are most vulnerable to a particular form of scam. Increasing public awareness is one key plank.\n",
      "How is the Government working to continually update the public on new forms of scams and keeping up with its public education and awareness efforts?\n",
      "Online Scams\n",
      "Mr Vikram Nair: Chairman, earlier this month, the Police Force released data on cybercrime which was reported by CNA and the figures were sobering. The amount lost to online scams the last two years has been staggering, around $632 million in 2021 and $661 million in 2022.  \n",
      "The total number of cybercrime cases rose by around 25% to 33,669 cases compared to 26,886 cases the year before. Scams accounted for 94.2% of these cases. Of these cybercrime cases, scams accounted for 94%.\n",
      "The top five scam types were phishing scams, job scams, e-commerce scams, investment scams and fake friend call scams. They made up about 80% of the top 10 scams.\n",
      "The largest amounts lost were to investment scams, about $198.8 million, followed by job scams, which caused around $117.4 million in losses. Somewhat surprisingly, at least to me, the largest group of victims were young adults, aged 20 to 39, who made up around 53% of all victims.\n",
      "It is good that the Police is keeping tracks and close tabs on cybercrime data and able to produce such information on the issue. I am interested to know what steps are being taken to combat cybercrime and whether the existing steps are enough. In particular, I wonder whether the Police believe any further steps need to be taken in educating the public better as well as steps that are required to catch and prosecute the perpetrators. \n",
      "Where these perpetrators are abroad, which I believe happens in many of the scams, have we had any success in capturing the perpetrators and/or recovering assets for victims?  \n",
      "The Chairman: Mr Derrick Goh, you can take your earlier cut as well.\n",
      "Concerning Increase in Youth Crimes\n",
      "Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon): Chairman, I mentioned in our Budget debate about the worrying trend we are seeing, where our youths perpetuating crimes is on the increase. \n",
      "On the scams front, SPF reported that majority of those arrested for e-commerce scams were youths. For first half of 2022, almost 60% of arrestees for e-commerce scams were aged below 29.\n",
      "4.00 pm\n",
      "While Singapore has been steadfast also in its zero-tolerance approach towards drugs, even amid more liberal attitudes towards the use of drugs both internationally and in the region, such as in Thailand, CNB has also highlighted a worrying trend of more youths abusing cannabis. \n",
      "While the drug situation in Singapore remains largely curbed, CNB reported that cannabis abusers arrested in 2022 climbed 71% to 236. Worryingly, over 60% of arrestees were aged below 30 and some even as young as 14.\n",
      "This is complicated by the continued emergence of new psychoactive substances and a quadrupling of vaping cases from 2020 to 2022. Such illicit habits appeal more to the youth and could be gateways to other forms of harder substance abuse as well as give rise to other social ills and offences. Moreover, accessibility to these harms is easily facilitated in the digital space, where youths can deal anonymously, which could be challenging for our agencies to detect. \n",
      "What is equally concerning is that in most cases, parents did not seem to be aware of their child's involvement with such harms. Can MHA explain its plans on how it can deepen engagement with all stakeholders in the ecosystem â parents, schools, youth groups, media platforms, and so on to identify at-risk youths for more timely and effective intervention? What further measures will MHA take to address this worrying trend of youth perpetrating crimes? \n",
      "Stepping Up Efforts to Combat Scams\n",
      "Despite the increased and commendable efforts by MHA and its partners, the scourge of scams remains unabated and continues to evolve. 2022 saw both a record 34,000 cases and a loss of well over S$660 million. This means that in the past two years, close to over S$1.3 billion has been lost to scams.\n",
      "A discerning public is our first line of defence. MHA has been strengthening public education efforts, through the ACT Against Scams campaign and by encouraging residents to download the ScamShield app.\n",
      "The Anti-Scam Command has also done well, partnering local banks to freeze more than 16,700 bank accounts and telcos to terminate more than 6,500 lines, thereby preventing a further loss of about S$146 million in 2022. Noteworthy, is the step up in anti-scam enforcements such as the recent islandwide operation in February where over 500 scammers and money mules were arrested.  \n",
      "Unlike physical crimes, scams are perpetrated by highly organised transnational syndicates and conducted swiftly in the digital space; and experts have also spoken about sophisticated operations that are aided by AI. \n",
      "Combatting scams hence requires a concerted \"all-hands-on-deck\" response. MHA should build upon its success to further deepen international co-operation with foreign law enforcement agencies, and partnerships with stakeholders like platform providers, for example, communication and social media firms, as well as e-commerce players in the digital value chain. To be effective, these stakeholders, who themselves benefit and profit from the digital ecosystem, need to do more, and have accountability clearly assigned, to drive more proactive upstream prevention of scams.  \n",
      "This will become important as recent trends show that while the number of scams have increased, the amount lost per transaction is smaller on average. This trend is expected to worsen as frictionless payments increase along with more cross-border linkages, such as the link-up of Singapore's PayNow with Thailand's PromptPay and, as announced last week, India's UPI.\n",
      "We are an international and well-digitalised financial centre. This makes us inevitably prone to cybercrimes. There is a pressing need for us to swiftly and resolutely act against scams to uphold public trust, as the digital world becomes more complex with greater cybersecurity risks.\n",
      "Singapore has often been lauded as one of the safest cities in the world, and we should uphold this standing in the digital sphere too.\n",
      "The Chairman: Minister Josephine Teo. \n",
      "The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo): Mr Chairman, at the outset, let me thank Mr Murali Pillai and Members for their recognition of our SCDF officers as well as the team behind Operation Lionheart. They have done us proud and in a very tragic situation, we are glad that Singapore was able to make a small contribution.\n",
      "Sir, Singapore remains one of the safest countries in the world. Since 2015, we have been ranked first in Gallup's Global Law and Order Report, except in 2021 when the survey was not conducted here due to the pandemic. In the 2022 World Justice Project Rule of Law Index, Singapore was ranked as one of the top three countries in \"order and security\", for the sixth time in a row. \n",
      "These accolades do not mean that we can take our peaceful state of affairs for granted. On the contrary, given the dynamic operating environment, the Home Team is constantly challenged with emerging threats. These include foreign interferences, scams and other cybercrimes, and a more permissive global attitude towards drugs.\n",
      "My MHA colleagues and I will share how we are responding to these challenges, and also address points raised by Members. Minister of State Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim will speak on our efforts to combat drug abuse, including by enhancing our rehabilitation programmes. Minister of State Sun Xueling will speak on our multi-pronged approach to tackle scams. I will speak about online crimes more generally. \n",
      "We have been able to keep our country safe and secure, in large part because the public has placed a high level of trust and confidence in the Home Team, and also do their part to uphold law and order. This compact between Singaporeans and the Home Team is important and extends to the online domain. I spoke at the SNDGG Committee of Supply debate about the digital social compact.\n",
      "Within our security social compact, the Government enacts laws and policies, giving due consideration to all parties who have a stake. We earn the public's trust by enforcing laws in a fair and transparent manner and by consistently delivering good safety and security outcomes. \n",
      "In the online space, the Government does not set out to dictate or curtail the adoption of technology or use of online platforms. However, we have a duty to protect our citizens from online harms, the same way we deal with threats in the physical domain. The measures we take must be reasonable and calibrated. As for the individual, we have a part to play by being alert and vigilant and by looking out for the vulnerable amongst us, who may be more susceptible to crimes carried out online. \n",
      "Mr Murali Pillai, Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim and Mr Vikram Nair asked for an update on legislation to target online criminal harms. Let me share our plan.\n",
      "Online harms are constantly evolving and take various forms. They include falsehoods, foreign interference and inappropriate sexual abuse material. Online mediums are also exploited to incite violence, carry out scams at scale and traffic drugs.\n",
      "There is a growing international consensus for rules to combat online harms. For example, jurisdictions such as the UK, the EU, Germany and Australia have introduced or proposed new laws to regulate the online space. \n",
      "Over the years, the Government has taken steps to deal with different types of harmful online content and behaviours. We introduced the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act and the Foreign Interference Countermeasures Act. The Broadcasting Act was recently amended to deal with harms that impact user safety, such as suicide and self-harm, cyberbullying and content likely to undermine racial and religious harmony. We can also block access to egregious content on online communications services, including social media platforms.\n",
      "But there remain gaps. There is online content which are criminal in their own right, or content which facilitate or abet crimes. These include syndicated crimes such as scams, online incitement of mass public disorder and malicious cyber activities such as phishing and the distribution of malware. We have been monitoring these developments closely and intend to update our suite of legislation to better protect our people.\n",
      "MHA will therefore be introducing the Online Criminal Harms Act later this year. The proposed Online Criminal Harms Act builds on our current laws in three ways.\n",
      "First, it will expand the scope of regulatory levers that we can apply to online criminal activities. This includes powers to stop or remove online communications that would facilitate crimes in the physical world, such as inciting violence. \n",
      "Second, it will increase the scope of entities we can act against. It will cover all mediums of online communication through which criminal activities could be conducted. \n",
      "Third, it will introduce levers that deal more effectively with the nature of online criminal harms. To Mr Derrick Goh's question on how online entities can be involved in prevention and be held more accountable, the new legislation will introduce upstream measures to detect and reduce scams such as safeguards against inauthentic accounts. This legislation will also apply to other malicious cyber activities like phishing.\n",
      "Mr Chairman, MHA continues to monitor closely one specific type of online harm, that of online gambling. As Members know, gambling is prohibited unless licensed or exempted. This applies whether gambling takes place online or physically. \n",
      "In 2022, we amended our gambling legislation to ensure that our laws are up-to-date and able to address emerging trends. This is especially as the lines between gambling and gaming have become blurred.\n",
      "Take the example of video games with loot boxes. They may feature a range of virtual items of value, which a player may win with varying probabilities. We allow games with such loot boxes via a class licensing regime, but only if the game fulfils either of two conditions. The loot box within the game must be entirely free of charge to play. Otherwise, the game must not contain monetisation facilities; meaning that players cannot exchange the virtual prizes for real-world pay-outs, such as money or merchandise. \n",
      "This is a practical and balanced approach. It ensures we safeguard against gambling inducement, rather than gaming. We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of our gambling legislation and update our regulatory approach where needed. \n",
      "Beyond legislation, the Home Team must constantly enhance our capabilities to respond to evolving threats. Mr Murali Pillai asked about the returns from our transformation efforts and how we will make future investments. \n",
      "Over the past five years, an average of about 30% of the Home Team's expenditure has been on capability development, including investing in new technological solutions. We will continue such investments to improve our operations and reduce our reliance on manpower. The results can be seen through how the Home Team has been transforming in four areas: Processes, Platforms, People and Partnerships â four \"Ps\". \n",
      "First, our processes. Over the years, we have used automation and biometrics to make our immigration clearance more efficient. Today, Singaporeans who travel through Changi Airport are familiar with the automated immigration clearance gates. \n",
      "We want to further smoothen clearance processes. Since January 2017, we have implemented 100% automated clearance for all motorcyclists at the land checkpoints. Following successful proof-of-concept trials, ICA and Home Team Science and Technology Agency (HTX) are now working to introduce automated in-car clearance for car travellers. Travellers will remain seated in the car and self-scan their passport and biometrics to verify their identities.\n",
      "4.15 pm\n",
      "With automated clearance, we expect overall faster and more secure clearance for car travellers. It also reduces the manpower demand, which can be deployed to meet other needs.\n",
      "Mr Christopher de Souza asked how technology helped tackle domestic and transnational crime and aid our ground operations.\n",
      "We have invested in new technology platforms such as those that improve incident response. In this regard, the use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) has been a game changer for the Home Team as it provides us with an eye in the sky that supplement ground officers and ground-based cameras. \n",
      "For example, SPF deployed such systems for crowd management at events, including heartland celebrations of the National Day Parade and the year-end countdown in 2022.\n",
      "HTX is further pushing the boundaries by trialling a system that can be operated remotely from a centralised command and control centre. This will allow SPF and SCDF commanders to receive visuals of the scene even before our officers arrive, allowing them to better plan their responses. \n",
      "Technology has also supported our fight against scams, which are crimes that often have a transnational element. Minister of State Sun will provide more details in her speech. \n",
      "The third \"P\" is people. Mr Christopher de Souza rightly pointed out the challenging manpower situation, which is why we have redesigned our training.  \n",
      "For example, our built environment is becoming more complex for our firefighting and rescue operations. \n",
      "The redeveloped Field Training Area at the Civil Defence Academy will host new infrastructure and stimulators that expand our training scenarios in an area nearly the size of three football fields. This will be ready in end 2023.\n",
      "The Home Team must also ensure that we have the specialised talent to enable our use of advanced technology, and Mr Murali Pillai asked how HTX has helped. \n",
      "Beyond consolidating capabilities from across the Home Team, HTX has developed deep expertise in areas ranging from biometrics to robotics and automation that support the Home Team's unique needs. The partnerships which HTX has forged, both with local research institutions and foreign counterparts, has enabled us to be at the forefront of new technological developments.\n",
      "So that it has enough talent, this year, HTX will be ramping up its recruitment and training of fresh Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) graduates from the universities as well as polytechnics. We will also include experienced professionals from the science, engineering and digital technology sectors. The target is to fill a total of 500 positions. \n",
      "Mr Chairman, our stakeholders and the public are ultimately who we serve. Technology has enabled us to enhance the final \"P\" â partnerships that are essential to the Home Team. \n",
      "For example, SCDF's myResponder app has been key to helping to activate Community First Responders (CFRs), who are members of the public, to provide immediate assistance before our officers arrive. \n",
      "There are more than 130,000 Community First Responders today. From 2015 to January this year, they have responded to over 3,000 minor fire cases, 6,000 suspected cardiac arrest cases and saved more than 40 lives. \n",
      "To better equip these responders to respond to minor fires, SCDF will start a new trial to place one fire extinguisher at the ground floor of every two HDB blocks. When fully implemented over five years, this will benefit 1.1 million HDB households.\n",
      "Mr Murali also asked about the lessons we have learnt from our transformation journey. \n",
      "One key lesson is that transformation does not just come about by deploying more technology. We must also streamline our processes, train our officers with the relevant skills and make our partners a part of our transformation.\n",
      "Mr Chairman, the Home Team transforms its capabilities so that it can continue to respond effectively to a wide range of threats. \n",
      "Some, like terrorist attacks, we hope, never to have to respond to. But we must be prepared nonetheless and realistic exercises are one way we can achieve this. \n",
      "In March this year, the Home Team will be conducting Exercise Northstar XI, a major ground exercise which will test multiagency responses to a terrorist attack on Jurong Island. Exercise Northstar will bring together over 300 participants from agencies such as Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), Singapore Police Force (SPF), Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), JTC and private sector partners. This is a valuable opportunity to validate our interagency responses and capabilities in a realistic setting. \n",
      "Sir, on a completely different track, let me address Mr Pritam Singh's questions about the selection criteria for new citizens and whether we consider an applicant's extent of integration into Singapore society as the Swiss appear to. \n",
      "The short answer is \"yes\". We certainly consider the ability of an applicant to integrate in Singapore. But unlike the Swiss system, we do not use a naturalisation test or interviews. \n",
      "All tests have pitfalls. Sample questions for the Swiss naturalisation test can easily be found online. One can learn the right answers that immigration authorities want to hear and not actually be integrated with locals. \n",
      "Interviews, if conducted at scale, will also be resource-intensive and uneven in quality. Results are also not conclusive. For example, in 2021, 41% of those with a migrant background felt that they were not perceived as Swiss. This is a survey that was conducted by the Swiss themselves.\n",
      "Instead, we consider various markers of social integration such as family ties to Singaporeans, length of residency, whether the applicant studied in our national schools or completed National Service. These are assessed together with their economic contributions, qualifications and age.\n",
      "All applicants must also complete the Singapore Citizenship Journey before being granted citizenship. This programme helps participants better appreciate our history and culture. It was recently refreshed and enhanced, with content co-created with ordinary Singaporeans.   \n",
      "Sir, these measures are by no means perfect, but they have generally served us well. As to Mr Pritam Singh's call to publicise detailed criteria for assessing citizenship applications, let me restate the key reasons not to do so, which remain valid.\n",
      "First, detailed criteria can be abused to inflate an undeserving applicant's chances of success. There are applicants who submit false documents just to obtain immigration facilities. This problem will be exacerbated if we publish the detailed criteria and applicants know exactly what areas they can game. ICA will have a harder time securing the integrity of our process.  \n",
      "Second, we have unique sensitivities by virtue of history and geography. Today, most of our Permanent Residents (PR) and new Singapore Citizens (SC) come from neighbouring regions. This is unsurprising. We do not reveal our detailed criteria or disclose country-specific figures on our PR and SC population as this information could be misinterpreted or misused by others to stir up bilateral and domestic sensitivities.\n",
      "Mr Singh spoke about a points-based system and asked why MOM publicises its criteria for the assessment of Employment Passes (EP) whereas we do not for PR and SC. \n",
      "The considerations for EP are quite different. They are mainly to supplement our workforce. For most EPs, the stay in Singapore will come to an end. For PRs and SCs, this is far less likely. We must therefore also consider how they impact our demographic make-up and social fabric over the long term. Because of the permanent nature of PR and SC facilities, the need to guard against gaming is also greater. Mr Chairman, allow me now to speak in Mandarin. \n",
      "(In Mandarin): [Please refer to Vernacular Speech.] Mr Chairman, Singapore remains one of the safest countries in the world, in large part because the public has placed a high level of trust and confidence in the Home Team, and do their part to uphold law and order. \n",
      "But we cannot take our peaceful state of affairs for granted. The Home Team must anticipate and deal with emerging and evolving threats. We continue to put in place new laws and policies to improve Singapore's safety and security. \n",
      "One such area is our approach towards online harms. We have witnessed the online medium increasingly being used to facilitate crimes, such as large-scale scam operations and malicious cyber activities. \n",
      "Therefore, later this year, MHA will introduce the Online Criminal Harms Act. This will build on our existing laws and strengthen our ability to deal with online criminal activities. This includes powers to stop or remove online communications that facilitate crimes in the physical world, such as inciting violence.\n",
      "The Home Team will also continue to enhance our capabilities and partner the public to keep Singapore safe. \n",
      "For example, there are more than 130,000 Community First Responders (CFRs) today, who are members of the public who can provide immediate assistance to minor fire and cardiac arrest cases before our officers arrive. \n",
      "To better equip CFRs to respond to minor fires, SCDF will be embarking on a new trial to place one fire extinguisher at the ground floor of every two HDB blocks. When fully implemented over five years, this will benefit 1.1 million HDB households.\n",
      "Mr Chairman, Singapore's success in meeting safety and security threats relies on the collective effort of the Home Team and the public. The Home Team will continue to do our utmost to live up to the trust and confidence Singaporeans have placed in us, so that Singapore will remain a safe and secure home for all of us. \n",
      "(In English): Thank you, Sir.\n",
      "The Chairman: Minister of State Muhammad Faishal.\n",
      "The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim): Mr Chairman, the Home Team continues to do well in keeping our streets safe. However, terrorism poses a serious threat to our security. \n",
      "Mr Christopher de Souza asked about efforts to combat terrorism.\n",
      "International cooperation is critical to tackling terrorism and terrorism financing. We work closely with overseas counterparts to share intelligence on potential terror threats and conduct joint operations. We will continue to enhance collaboration through international platforms such as the Financial Action Task Force and INTERPOL.\n",
      "Within Singapore, we have implemented structures and processes to take swift action against terrorism financing. This includes the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism Steering Committee, which coordinates efforts amongst Government agencies.\n",
      "We also work closely with private sector partners under the Countering the Financing of Terrorism Operational Group. This workgroup facilitates round-the-clock investigative collaboration, allowing us to investigate terrorism financing expeditiously.\n",
      "Youth radicalisation cases have increased significantly in recent years. From 2002 to 2014, only two youths aged 20 were dealt with under the Internal Security Act (ISA) for terrorism-related activities. Since 2015, ISA orders were issued to 11 self-radicalised youths aged 20 and below.\n",
      "Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim asked about measures to address youth radicalisation. The Internal Security Department (ISD) has intensified its outreach. In 2022, ISD organised close to 70 counter-terrorism or radicalisation outreach events in schools and Institutes of Higher Learning targeting students and educators. This includes workshops to train school counsellors to identify signs of radicalisation and on early intervention. \n",
      "The upcoming Online Criminal Harms Act announced by the Second Minister earlier will also give us powers to direct takedowns of online content facilitating radicalisation. As the threat of terrorism in Singapore remains high, we will continue to enhance our operational capabilities and expand our outreach.\n",
      "4.30 pm\n",
      "I will now address cuts on drugs. Globally, drug use continues to rise, posing challenges to keeping Singapore drug-free. Locally, while the drug situation remains under control, we are concerned with drug abuse amongst youths. While most youths support a tough stance against drugs, some younger Singaporeans take a more permissive attitude, especially towards cannabis. \n",
      "Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked how we are preventing drug abuse. We will continue to strengthen our harm prevention approach to combat drug abuse. Our first line of defence against drugs is a well-informed public. Mr Christopher de Souza and Mr Derrick Goh asked about preventive drug education (PDE) for youths. \n",
      "The Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) will expand PDE efforts in schools. Secondary schools which did not do a PDE engagement in the last two years, will conduct at least one engagement in 2023. Moving forward, CNB is working with MOE to ensure all primary and secondary schools conduct at least one PDE programme annually. \n",
      "With TikTok becoming increasingly popular amongst youths, CNB launched its TikTok account last year, which regularly posts short videos of our drug enforcement efforts. Mr Christopher de Souza asked about sensitising the public to the threat of drug liberalisation globally. CNB highlights trends of concern in the global drug situation through various communication channels.\n",
      "As part of the #CNBPerspectives Series launched in 2022, CNB took to Facebook and Instagram to share worrying trends from the World Drug Report 2022. In fact, I also posted things relating to this to support their effort. These include the increase of cannabis-use disorders in jurisdictions which legalise cannabis for non-medical use. We also educate our anti-drug abuse advocates about the increasingly permissive views other countries have towards drugs and train them to speak up against drugs. \n",
      "The second pillar of our anti-drug strategy is tough laws and robust enforcement. To deter Singaporeans and PRs from abusing drugs overseas, CNB has stepped up enforcement at the checkpoints with the deployment of Saliva Test Kits from January this year. These kits, like the one I am holding here â they are light and compact. They offer a more efficient way to detect drug abusers at the checkpoints. \n",
      "This month, CNB and Police started trialling joint roadblock operations to detect drug abusers. Saliva Test Kits will also be used. Mr Derrick Goh asked about enforcement against New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) and vaping. The speed and breadth at which NPS variants have appeared have often outpaced authorities' ability to control them.\n",
      "On 24 February, MHA introduced a Bill to amend the Misuse of Drugs Act to control psychoactive substances based on their capacity to produce psychoactive effects rather than their chemical structure alone. This will empower CNB to take swift enforcement actions against illicit activities involving NPS. Enforcement against vaping will be addressed at the Ministry of Health (MOH)'s COS.   \n",
      "The third pillar of our anti-drug strategy is enhancing rehabilitation. Mr Raj Joshua Thomas asked about efforts to reduce drug recidivism. CNB recently reviewed its drug supervision regime and has deployed suitable officers to take on specialist roles in supervision to enhance the rehabilitation process. \n",
      "As I had announced last year, CNB has been piloting Community Supervision Sessions, in short, CoSS, since 2019, where supervision officers help supervisees address financial, housing and other rehabilitation needs.\n",
      "A supervisee who has benefited from CoSS is 46-year-old Mr Aidil. After his release from the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC) in 2021, Aidil was afraid of not being able to find a suitable job. Through CoSS sessions, Aidil was given career guidance and advice on his rehabilitation needs by his supervision officer. With this support, Aidil landed a part-time job within five months of his release. \n",
      "As the pilot has shown good results, I am pleased to announce that CoSS will be progressively rolled out to all supervisees by June this year. \n",
      "Mr Murali Pillai asked about support for desistors with drug-abusing pasts. The Singapore Prison Service (SPS) has enhanced its Psychology-based Correctional Programmes (PCPs) to be more targeted for repeated drug abusers during their in-care period. These PCPs will cater more time to address negative attitudes and improve emotional regulation, as both factors contribute to repeated drug use.\n",
      "Mr Murali Pillai, Mr Christopher de Souza, Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim and Mr Raj Joshua Thomas asked about efforts to reduce recidivism, and Mr Patrick Tay and Dr Tan Wu Meng asked about improving the employability of ex-offenders. \n",
      "Singapore's two-year recidivism rate is low and stable at around 20% for the 2020 release cohort. Our five-year rate is higher, at between 40% to 43%. Reducing long-term recidivism will not be easy. We must work with community partners to offer offenders and drug abusers an eco-system of support, starting from when they enter our prisons and DRCs and continuing after their release. Let me share our strategy to support them. \n",
      "First, by enhancing their skills and employment outcomes. Gainful employment allows ex-offenders to be financially independent and reduces risks of re-offending. In 2023, SPS and Yellow Ribbon Singapore (YRSG) will continue to work with partners to help ex-offenders upskill and boost their longer-term career progression. \n",
      "In collaboration with the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), SPS has set up education hubs to enrol more inmate students. In 2023, SPS will work with ITE to run more short courses, such as the Computer Maintenance course, following positive reviews.\n",
      "I am pleased to announce that YRSG is launching the YR Sandbox initiative to develop new career options in emerging sectors. YRSG will work with industry partners to hire releasing inmates and provide on-the-job training or work-study programmes. Potential sectors include skilled sectors like Digital, Built Environment and Agri-Tech.\n",
      "This new initiative complements TAP & Grow â TAP meaning \"Train and Place\". This scheme provides inmates with industry training in prison and potential job placement with a partner employer. TAP & Grow has been launched in the Precision Engineering, Media and Logistics and Wholesale sectors. As of 2022, a total of 422 inmates have completed the training programmes. \n",
      "In 2023, YRSG will expand TAP & Grow to Food Services, which we expect to benefit up to 700 inmates and ex-offenders annually. \n",
      "Mr Murali Pillai asked about the Uplifting Employment Credit (UEC). It will provide time-limited wage offsets to encourage employers to hire ex-offenders. More will be announced at MOM's COS. Currently, about two-thirds of ex-offenders secure employment within six months of release. We hope to improve this and will raise awareness of the UEC and other available support amongst employers.\n",
      "Dr Tan Wu Meng asked about recognition for inclusive employers. In 2022, over 200 employers, community partners, ex-offenders and volunteers were recognised for their contributions towards second chances through the Yellow Ribbon Awards. \n",
      " Sir, I would like to express my appreciation for NTUC in joining SPS and YRSG in engaging with inmates and ex-offenders to understand their concerns, priorities and aspirations through the #EveryWorkerMatters conversation.\n",
      "Second by strengthening pro-social support in the community. The community, including ex-offenders themselves and their family plays a critical role. Mr Christopher de Souza asked about enhancing post-release mentorship. \n",
      "I am pleased to announce that SPS has piloted a new scheme for volunteers to assist in the case management of selected supervisees emplaced on Community-Based Programmes (CBPs). Volunteer Case Officers will guide the supervisees towards a pro-social life during and beyond the CBP.\n",
      "SPS is working with community partners to launch the Desistor Network in April this year. Desistors who have stayed clear of crime and drugs will serve as mentors to recently released ex-offenders. This will also strengthen desistors' sense of self as contributing members of the community. \n",
      "Mr Raj Joshua Thomas asked about follow-ups from the CARE Network Summit 2022 and expanding YRSG's role. YRSG will continue to work closely with SPS and community partners via the CARE Network to tackle long-term recidivism. From 2023, the CARE Network will tap on the Desistor Network to co-opt desistors in planning and conducting programmes for ex-offenders.\n",
      "Family support is also critical. Mr Murali Pillai asked about supporting offenders to mend family ties. To aid in their family reintegration, SPS works with community partners to provide family programmes to inmates and befriending and other pro-social support to ex-offenders after release.\n",
      "Mr Christopher de Souza and Mr Raj Joshua Thomas asked about creating greater acceptance for ex-offenders and recruiting more volunteers to help with rehabilitation.  \n",
      "The Yellow Ribbon Project's (YRP) outreach has generated high awareness and support. Based on a 2022 survey, about 91% of respondents were aware of YRP's objectives, rehabilitation challenges faced by ex-offenders and the need to reduce stigma towards them. SPS and YRSG have expanded roles and training for volunteers in areas of in-care and aftercare, including support for families. Collectively, SPS and YRSG have more than 4,000 volunteers supporting rehabilitation.\n",
      "In 2023, YRSG will focus on showcasing inmates and ex-offenders' talents and contributions to reiterate that ex-offenders can contribute to society.\n",
      "Mr Murali Pillai asked about allowing desistors to perform at National Day Parades (NDPs). We have been providing desistors with opportunities to showcase their talent at public events. The Yellow Ribbon Performing Arts Centre Alumni Band had performed at Red Dot August at the Esplanade for the past three years. We will explore more opportunities. \n",
      "Mr Raj Joshua Thomas asked about alleviating the impact of incarceration on one's family. Yellow Ribbon Community Project (YRCP) grassroots volunteers have engaged over 19,000 families since 2010, linking them to community assistance and ensuring their well-being. In 2023, we will strengthen support for inmates' families by collaborating with more community resources, such as religious organisations, Social Service Offices (SSOs) and Family Service Centres (FSCs).\n",
      "Mr Patrick Tay asked for a review of the Registration of Criminals Act on spent offences. From time to time, MHA reviews the spent regime for criminal records. In our last review in 2021, we assessed that the existing regime continues to be appropriate to facilitate the reintegration of ex-offenders, in particular those who committed minor crimes. This position took into consideration the many initiatives to facilitate reintegration and reduce long-term recidivism. \n",
      "Mr Patrick Tay asked about support for female ex-offenders. In September 2022, SPS set up a secular all-women halfway house, named Rise Above Halfway House (RAHWH). RAHWH provides gender-responsive interventions and facilitates social reintegration for the residents. As of February 2023, 31 female offenders have been emplaced to RAHWH. We will continue to support female ex-offenders and facilitate their reintegration.\n",
      "4.45 pm\n",
      "Next, Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim asked about collaboration with the Malay-Muslim community to better support inmates and ex-offenders. I will now speak in Malay about our community's crucial role. \n",
      "(In Malay): [Please refer to Vernacular Speech.] Sir, many Malay-Muslim Organisations (MMOs) have stepped forward to work with SPS and CNB to prevent offending and re-offending by providing support to inmates, ex-offenders, and their family from incarceration to post-release. These include AMP, FITRAH, Jamiyah, PERGAS, PPIS, PERTAPIS, Yayasan Mendaki and a number of mosques.\n",
      "Let me share some examples of how these MMOs have stepped forward to offer assistance.\n",
      "FITRAH has developed a values-centric in-care religious programme for inmates and prepares Friday Prayer sermons that are contextualised to their rehabilitation needs.\n",
      "FITRAH has galvanised all 71 mosques to support inmates, ex-offenders and their family, beyond zakat assistance. Today, all mosques are familiar with FITRAH's work and refer them to FITRAH for support, such as befriending.\n",
      "Many MMOs have joined Singapore's efforts in supporting rehabilitation. MHA recognises that there is value in coordinating all these efforts to create greater synergy. In November 2021, we launched the MMO Rehabilitation Network, which brings together 26 MMOs and all eleven MÂ³@Towns.\n",
      "Since its launch, many collaborations have been forged. For example, FITRAH has collaborated with New Life Stories to develop a referral system where they can tap on each other's expertise. Jamiyah Halfway House has collaborated with the West Mosque Cluster to further support the reintegration of its residents.\n",
      "Supporting inmates, ex-offenders and their family is an endeavour that cannot be undertaken by the Home Team alone. I am thankful to MMOs for working closely with us to uplift and make a difference to the lives of our beneficiaries.\n",
      "Your efforts and contributions have helped to keep the recidivism rates low and the number of new drug abusers stable. Keep up the good work!\n",
      "(In English): Sir, in conclusion, thanks to our Home Team Officers, Singapore remains safe and secure. We will continue to work with our community partners to combat terrorism, prevent drug abuse and support our inmates and ex-offenders.\n",
      "The Chairman: Minister of State Sun Xueling.\n",
      "The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling): Mr Chairman, we have a war against scams on our hands. In 2022, we saw 31,728 scam cases, a 32.6% increase from 2021. More than $660 million was lost, 4.5% higher than 2021. \n",
      "Mr Sitoh Yin Pin asked for an update on the Government's efforts to combat scams. I chair the Inter-Ministry Committee on Scams, which leads a multi-agency effort to develop a systems wide collective shield to protect us from scams. We deploy a multi-layered defence strategy against scams: first, we endeavour to block scam calls, SMSes, online listings and websites; second, we secure Government services and banking channels; third, we strengthen our enforcement capabilities; and lastly, we strengthen our laws.\n",
      "Mr Christopher de Souza and Mr Vikram Nair asked how the Government partners industry and people sector stakeholders to combat scams. Mr Christopher de Souza asked about the use of technology in our efforts to fight scams. \n",
      "The Home Team has established partnerships across Government, private and people sectors, using technology to aid our efforts.\n",
      "For calls, SPF works closely with local telecommunication companies to terminate mobile lines used for scams. In 2022, more than 6,500 such mobile lines were terminated. The SPF also engaged WhatsApp on more than 22,800 WhatsApp lines believed to be used in scams in 2022.\n",
      "For SMSes, IMDA mandated SMS Sender ID registration from January 2023 and implemented anti-scam filters to detect potential scam SMSes. Under the Sender ID regime, all non-registered senders are flagged as \"Likely-SCAM\". After a transition period, SMSes carrying unregistered Sender IDs will be blocked upfront. \n",
      "To address scams arising from international numbers, the IMDA is exploring offering the option to members of the public to not to receive international calls and SMSes. More details will be released when ready.\n",
      "For online listings, the SPF partners social media companies and e-marketplaces to remove suspicious accounts and advertisements. In 2022, more than 3,100 accounts and advertisements suspected of involvement in scams were removed. \n",
      "For websites, SPF uses analytic tools to identify and block scam websites, by detecting tell-tale characteristics. In 2022, about 20,000 scam websites were blocked. \n",
      "The Home Team also works with stakeholders to secure Government services and banking channels, so scammers cannot exploit system vulnerabilities.\n",
      "We have onboarded all Government agencies onto the SMS Sender ID registry, making Government agencies harder to spoof. We are considering measures that allow the verification of incoming calls from Government officials.\n",
      "The SPF also deepened their partnership with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and domestic banks to flag and freeze suspicious accounts. Over the past year, MAS worked with the Association of Banks in Singapore, or ABS in short, on the following measures: (a) a cooling-off period for provisioning new digital tokens; (b) removing clickable links from official emails and SMSes; (c) lowering default transaction limits; and (d) an emergency self-service \"kill switch\", allowing customers to suspend their accounts quickly if compromised. \n",
      "The MAS and the ABS are exploring a \"Money Lock\" solution, which enables customers to \"lock up\" a designated sum in their bank accounts. This reduces the amount that could potentially be lost to scams via digital transfers. \n",
      "Mr Derrick Goh spoke about the increased use of foreign payment gateways. As more foreign gateways open up, we are also working with MAS to review and enhance the suite of anti-scam measures to mitigate the risk of these channels being used for illicit purposes.\n",
      "Mr Chairman, no defence is impenetrable. Some scams will succeed. For example, investment scams and job scams, which contributed to the bulk of monies lost to scams in Singapore, are very hard to tackle. We have thus strengthened our enforcement capabilities, to minimise the number of victims and amounts lost to scammers.\n",
      "[Deputy Speaker (Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo) in the Chair]\n",
      "The Anti-Scam Command was formed last year to consolidate expertise in combatting scams across the SPF. In 2022, 25 island-wide anti-scam enforcement operations led to over 8,000 money mules and scammers being investigated.\n",
      "Mr Vikram Nair asked about our collaborations with foreign law enforcement authorities to address the transnational nature of scams. The SPF works closely with their foreign counterparts to exchange information and conduct joint operations. In 2022, this led to the successful take-down of 13 syndicates. The SPF arrested more than 70 people based overseas, who were responsible for more than 280 scam cases.\n",
      "Mr Christopher de Souza also asked about MHA's plans to reduce the prevalence of money mules. We intend to tighten the law against those who facilitate the movement of scam proceeds.\n",
      "Currently, the vast majority of money mule investigations do not result in prosecution. Based on current laws, we need to prove that the money mule knew that the monies he was handling were linked to criminal activity. We will amend the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act, or CDSA, to prescribe specific conduct for which we can hold mules criminally liable. \n",
      "MHA is also working with SNDGO on legislative amendments to the Penal Code to curb abuse of SingPass credentials as a vector to perpetrate scams. \n",
      "Given the evolving landscape of scams, new forms of scams will emerge. Mr Christopher de Souza asked about the processes in place to inform and activate stakeholders to address the latest scams. \n",
      "Once we are aware of an emergent scam, the SPF works with the media and other stakeholders to publicise information on it so that the public can be put on guard. The SPF also taps on its partnerships with sectoral stakeholders to swiftly activate a multi-layered defence, which we adapt as the scam evolves. \n",
      "The best defence against scams is a vigilant and discerning public. To defend ourselves and our loved ones, we need to move beyond awareness, to mobilise every citizen to take action against scams. \n",
      "Mr Christopher de Souza asked how the Government is keeping up our public education efforts to prevent scams. In January this year, we launched a new national anti-scam campaign with the tagline \"I can ACT against scams\" as our rallying call.\n",
      "ACT is an acronym for three key actions that each of us can take to keep ourselves safe from scams. \"A\" stands for Adding security features such as installing the ScamShield app on mobile devices. \"C\" stands for Checking for scam signs and verifying with official sources. \"T\" stands for Telling authorities, family and friends about scams.\n",
      "We will be launching the Scam Public Education Office later this year to drive our collective efforts with community partners and expand our outreach on scams, including (a) collaborating with NCPC to create and curate anti-scam public education content at the national level; and (b) working with private sector and community agencies to tailor our anti-scam public education efforts for different population segments.  \n",
      "In September 2022, we expanded the ScamShield app to Android device users. ScamShield protects users by blocking calls from known scam numbers and filtering out potential scam SMSes. It also allows users to report scam calls and scam SMSes. We are working closely with GovTech to roll out ScamShield 2.0, which will include a WhatsApp chatbot for the public to report scam messages. \n",
      "I encourage all citizens to download and use the ScamShield app. By playing your part in reporting scam calls, SMSes, and WhatsApp messages, you protect others by enabling the Police to detect scam messages and fraudulent WhatsApp accounts much more quickly and to put these scam messages on a blacklist. \n",
      "Mr Derrick Goh spoke about potential levers to ensure co-operation and accountability with stakeholders. Last year, we launched the E-commerce Marketplace Transaction Safety Ratings (TSR), a consumer advisory that reviews and tracks the transaction safety of major e-commerce marketplaces based on specific metrics. The TSR encourages marketplaces to deter and detect scams committed on their platforms. It allows consumers to make informed decisions on where to do their online shopping safely. We will be refreshing the platform ratings in the TSR in April. \n",
      "Mr Murali Pillai referred to his previous suggestion for SPF to publish the amounts seized and returned to victims. The SPF does not actively track the cumulative dollar value of assets recovered and the amount returned to victims. The seizure of $172.8 million in assets that Mr Pillai referred to, was a statistic quoted from INTERPOL's article, about a global INTERPOL operation that Singapore participated in.\n",
      "5.00 pm\n",
      "Beyond being aware and acting against scams, we need to educate the public on the consequences of engaging in scam activities. Mr Derrick Goh asked about our efforts and partnerships to address the increase in youths involved with scams and to encourage positive youth development. \n",
      "A key initiative for youths is the biannual Delta League, run by SPF and NCPC. Youth participants engage in sports and participate in crime prevention activities, which enhance their awareness of the consequences of crime. More than 1,200 youths participated in the most recent Delta League which engaged participants in activities that educated them on scams.\n",
      "SPF also issues mid-year and year-end advisories to students and parents through schools to remind students to steer clear of crime, including being alert against attempts to trick them into becoming money mules. The SPF will continue to work with its stakeholders to promote a sense of social responsibility among our youths.\n",
      "Dr Shahira Abdullah suggested having a one-stop unit to assist scam victims and address their financial and emotional needs.\n",
      "The Victim Care Cadre programme under the SPF provides support to crime victims. Where needed, the Police activate volunteer Victim Care Officers, or VCOs, who work with the Police Psychological Services Department to provide psychological first aid. Where necessary, the VCOs will also direct victims to available community and professional resources for longer-term psychological support and/or financial support. This includes Family Service Centres, Samaritans of Singapore and the hospitals. \n",
      "Dr Shahira Abdullah spoke about disabled scam victims, and deaf persons in particular, getting timely help. Crime victims have multiple avenues for reporting, including online. If a report is lodged in person, the Police buildings are designed to be accessible for persons with disabilities. And if needed, sign language interpreters will be engaged to assist.  \n",
      "I will now address a question on the working hours of security officers. Mr Raj Joshua Thomas asked if the Government would take the lead to regularise their hours, by requiring shorter shift hours for all Government security contracts. \n",
      "Since 2020, it has been mandatory for public agencies to adopt outcome-based contracts for procuring security services. New tenders are generally required to specify outcomes, rather than dictate a fixed headcount or shift hours. This allows security agencies to optimise security solutions that integrate manpower, technology and processes, giving them the flexibility to decide on the duration of each security officer's shift. The Government will continue working with tripartite partners to further improve the working conditions of security officers.\n",
      "Mr Chairman, kindly allow me to say a few words in Mandarin.\n",
      "(In Mandarin): [Please refer to Vernacular Speech.] We are fighting a war against scams. Scammers are vicious and cunning. They prey on our natural human needs and motivation such as desire for companionship or additional income to support our families.\n",
      "Scammers often exploit our individual characteristics. For example, compliant residents may be targeted by scammers impersonating Government agents. The scammers may also target those who are impulsive in nature and create an artificial sense of urgency and require the victims to transfer money and provide information promptly.\n",
      "Scammed victims are often hurt more than just financially. They also suffer emotionally as well as mentally. In cases of love scams or fake friend calls, scammers normally take time to cultivate a close relationship with the victim, gaining their trust before draining their bank accounts. These victims not only suffer financial losses, but also often feel guilty or betrayed. They are hurt deeply emotionally and may even have difficulties to trust others in future.\n",
      "As with modern military weapons, the design of scams takes the form of innovative disguises meant to target our needs and desires. The traps they set up are everywhere and every day we find ourselves barraged by various scams. \n",
      "I would like to emphasize here that everyone could encounter scammers, and everyone can be scammed. We must remain vigilant and never let our guard down.  \n",
      "(In English): Mr Chairman, everyone has a part to play to keep Singapore safe and secure. While the Government will step up measures to protect us against scams, we need to remain alert and ready to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe. Beyond exercising individual responsibility, let us also look out for and support others in our community, to strengthen our collective resilience. Together, we will be able to fight the war against scams.\n",
      "The Chairman: Leader of the Opposition.\n",
      "Mr Pritam Singh: Thank you, Mdm Chair. Just some clarification questions for Minister pertaining to my cut on new citizen selection which would come under the ambit of the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority.\n",
      "The first clarification I have is the point about sensitivities. I think Minister shared that countries-specific information is not put out because it can be misinterpreted, I believe that is what the Minister said. I stand corrected if that is incorrect.\n",
      "My point is, based on the latest Census, and the Census before that, in 10-year intervals, information on the place of birth of PRs and citizens is actually provided in 10-yearly intervals. So, the countries that are covered â Malaysia, China, India, Indonesia, Europe, USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and other Asian countries â this information that is already provided. So, what specific sensitivities is the Minister referring to when the Minister says that revealing countries-specific information could be misinterpreted?\n",
      "The second question has to do with my point in the cut, I do not believe Minister addressed it. It has to do with English as a criterion for citizenship selection because of its utility as a language of better integration between Singaporeans and new citizens. Can the Minister confirm whether this is part of the process in assessing individuals for citizenship?\n",
      "My third clarification is on the refreshed Singapore Citizenship journey that Minister spoke of. Very recently, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs in Singapore, Mr George Yeo, spoke of suggestion of new citizens being approved by a jury of ordinary Singaporeans and these are his comments:\n",
      "\"We are completely self-interested. So, we bring in clever people, wealthy people, connected people. But some of them when they come in, they think they are a blessing to Singaporeans and act as if we should be pleased that they are here. I met some of them when I was a Member of Parliament. They talk as if we owe them. Now, this psychology is very important that Singaporeans do not feel that the foreigners whom we bring in are lording over them and looking down on them and misbehaving.\"\n",
      "In this regard, Minister said that the content of the refreshed â\n",
      "The Chairman: Mr Singh, could you get to your question?\n",
      "Mr Pritam Singh: Yes, I am putting my question across now, Mdm Chair. And in this context, with regard to the refreshed Singapore Citizenship journey, Minister shared that the content was co-created with Singaporeans. Can I just confirm with the Minister, which aspect of the content is she referring to? Thank you, Mdm Chair.\n",
      "Mrs Josephine Teo: Mdm Chair, I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his questions. He asked what aspects of our immigration information is not broken down by specific countries. And I believe if you look at the reports to do with annual awards of Permanent Residency and Singapore Citizenship, we speak of the regions from which the new citizens as well as the new permanent residents originate from.\n",
      "On the second question that he asked for a clarification on, Mdm Chair, if I may ask the Leader of the Opposition is he advocating that a test of English should be applied before someone can be considered for Permanent Residency and citizenship? Is he advocating a position or he is merely asking a question?\n",
      "Mdm Deputy Speaker: Mr Singh.\n",
      "Mr Pritam Singh: Mdm Chair, I thank the Minister for that. I believe it would be helpful, so I would advocate for it. And I used the peg of the findings of the latest Census report which spoke of English and how commonly it is spoken in Singapore, comparing 2020 to 2010 and it is much more widely spoken today. So, the peg that I am coming in from is its utility as a tool to improve integration between Singaporeans and new citizens.\n",
      "So, in that regard, given the new information that we have, I believe it could be a helpful tool to improve integration.\n",
      "Just on the first clarification that Minister provided, I do not think Minister answered the question. I am suggesting that those countries, the information which shows where someone was born is actually already provided in 10-year Census. So, what sensitivities apply with regard to not wanting to release that information on a yearly basis when I see it releases its information on PRs and citizenships awarded that year?\n",
      "Mrs Josephine Teo: I think we have said this on previous occasions. I think you can imagine the scenario if you publish this information on such a current basis, how this information can be misinterpreted and also can be used to suggest that we are friendly or not as friendly to certain nationalities, and even to certain ethnicities. I do not have anything new to add to the previous explanations that had been provided.\n",
      "On Mr Singh's advocacy of us using English perhaps as a test of the ability of a new citizen or permanent resident to integrate, I must admit to being quite surprised by his position, the reason being that firstly, one can imagine that for most applicants to permanent residency and citizenship if they have been in Singapore for a number of years, particularly if they had worked here, a facility with English is not surprising. And I would think a test need not be applied.\n",
      "For those who perhaps do not have the facility with English, cannot communicate easily in English, I think from our ground interactions, it is also quite clear who these individuals are likely to be. They are likely to be spouses of citizens or other permanent residents and have come from the same country of origin and unless we are saying that we, therefore, do not welcome such foreign spouses, then I am not sure to what extent a test of English that could be applied to prevent them from being considered would be helpful.\n",
      "Thirdly, on the ground, every day we meet with residents who cannot speak a word of English. I do not think anyone would suggest that they are any less integrated to Singapore society. As to some of the comments he made about applicants who may lord it over Singaporeans and so on, I am not sure what the question is, perhaps I could ask him to repeat it.\n",
      "The Chairman: Mr Singh, please keep it succinct so that others will have a chance to also ask their clarifications.\n",
      "5.15 pm\n",
      "Mr Pritam Singh: Yes, Mdm Chair. The question was with regard to the point that Minister made in her speech about the refreshed Singapore Citizenship Journey. And she mentioned that the content was co-created with citizens. So, I have asked what aspect of the content was co-created by citizens.\n",
      "Mrs Josephine Teo: I do not have the details of those content. But if the Leader of the Opposition is interested, we could share it with them. The Singapore Citizenship Journey includes materials that are shared with the applicants to our citizenship. And they can look at these materials in order to be more familiar with Singapore history and culture. Those probably have involved other citizens in terms of their development. And there is also, if I recall correctly, a component of the Singapore Citizenship Journey that takes these applicants to various locations. Those are materials that we can provide to you. \n",
      "The Chairman: Mr Christopher de Souza.\n",
      "Mr Christopher de Souza: Thank you, Chair, I have three clarifications. One on scams, one on cannabis and one on technology.\n",
      "My experience on the ground is, in terms of scams, it happens very, very quickly. Within a span of three weeks, I had two separate families come and see me. One had lost $280,000 and one having lost $80,000. And what they shared with me is that, through many money mule accounts in Singapore, money is transferred from account to account, and then transferred out. And while they are interested in prosecution of those involved in this, they are most concerned with the recovery of the money.\n",
      "That is the sentiment on the ground. My humble suggestion and respectful suggestion is that, we build in a \"kill switch\" that would just stop the flow of money from one account to the next account prior to it leaving our shores. So, would that be considered or enhanced?\n",
      "The second point is about cannabis. I listened very carefully to the Minister of State Faishal's response and I thank him for that. Would it be useful to share with the public the long-term societal harm of recreational cannabis use? And I use Washington state is a good starting point. I am not saying it has worked well or negatively there, but it is the 10th year anniversary of Washington state legalising recreational use of marijuana. I think it did so in December 2012.\n",
      "So, if we can have some statistical, empirical evidential data on what the societal effect, the effect on society are â employability, mental health, family relationships, long term â then, we will be on firmer standing on our zero-tolerance to drugs.\n",
      "The Chairman: Mr de Souza, can you ask your clarifications?\n",
      "Mr Christopher de Souza: Yes, Madam. Third point is technology. I thank Minister Mrs Josephine Teo for her explanation on how we are using drones and unmanned surveillance equipment. My humble suggestion is that that not substitute the need for good human ground judgement in order to know how to prevent crime and also disperse crowds. I am speaking up very much in favour of the retention of best-in-class, world-class officers on the ground to do their job, and not an over-reliance on technology. Thank you, Chair, for your Indulgence.\n",
      "The Chairman: Minister of State Sun.\n",
      "Ms Sun Xueling: I thank the Member Mr Christopher de Souza on his first question regarding scams. Indeed, we have a \"kill switch\" which I mentioned in my main reply. This emergency self-service \"kill switch\" allows customers to suspend their accounts quickly, if compromised. But this is their own account. As noted by Mr Christopher de Souza, what happens often is that the original sum of monies from the bank account, customer's account, gets dismantled, dispersed and then, goes through the banking system into various other bank accounts not owned by them. So, while the bank account, the original bank account holder, the victim has activated the \"kill switch\" for his or her own account, it has not stopped the monies from being transferred to other accounts.\n",
      "And that is why what we intend to do with the money mules is an important step because we want to prevent these money mules from setting up or using multiple bank accounts to allow the scam proceeds to filter through the system. We have also co-located the seven major retail banks together at Anti-Scam Command so that they can coordinate their efforts.\n",
      "I would like to give an example of one case I looked at. There was one victim. And guess how many accounts the original sum of monies went through? Eighty-nine bank accounts. That was how quickly bank accounts were set up and the monies is dispersed through the banking system. And that is why it is important that we work with the various retail banks to have the retail banks co-located together so that we can share information quickly and for the banks to quickly trace the monies and close off those bank accounts and stop the monies from moving through the banking system and then, out of Singapore, whereby it is then out of our jurisdiction.\n",
      "The Chairman: Minister of State Faishal.\n",
      "Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim: Madam, I thank Member Mr Christopher de Souza for the suggestion. Indeed, we have been studying the effects and we also have been sharing some of these through our various platforms, including our #CNB Perspective Series. And essentially, if you look, for example, in the US, for those jurisdiction where cannabis is legalised, you see that the prevalence of cannabis consumption is significantly higher in these states, compared to the overall average. So, that is one.\n",
      " Another part is, we can also see the more adverse effects, in terms of the medical and health perspective, and also the number of emergency visits and treatments that have been required.\n",
      "For example, in California, after the opening of the retail sales market for cannabis, emergency visits and admissions related to any cannabis use increased by 56% from 2016 to 2019. These are things that we continue to follow because we are convinced of the harmful effects of drugs, including cannabis, and we want to share a lot more of these with our people.\n",
      "In fact, in the coming months, I am going to share, through my social media platforms, some of the perspectives that we know, that we have learnt from our counterparts overseas, who may have a different stance on drugs. We will do that. And I thank the Member for believing in this; and we really, really appreciate your support.\n",
      "The Chairman: Minister Josephine Teo.\n",
      "Mrs Josephine Teo: Mdm Chair, I thank Mr Christopher de Souza for reaffirming the importance of our officers and their skills level, even as we deploy more technology in carrying out our mission. Let me assure him that the points that he made are definitely not lost on us. Ultimately, we will still need officers who have the judgement. We need officers who understand our cultural context and our operating conditions in order that they will be able to put the technologies to good use.\n",
      "Even in the way we develop the technologies, we need human talent. I mentioned in my speech earlier that HTX intends to fill something like 500 positions this year alone. And if you compare it to the size of HTX today, which is about 1,500, that is still a 25% increase simply to build the capabilities to use technology more effectively.\n",
      "So, it is a question of where we are deploying our talent resources in the sense of using technology as a force multiplier. That is still the approach that we hope to take in order to serve Singaporeans better, in order to protect Singaporeans through use of technology in the appropriate way and also to do so in such a manner as not to overly strain our resources.\n",
      "The Chairman: Mr Gan Thiam Poh.\n",
      "Mr Gan Thiam Poh: Mdm Chair, I just overheard about the saliva test kit. Can Minister of State share more about it. I find it quite interesting. It is very welcome.\n",
      "Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim: I have tried it. [Laughter.] Essentially, if you look at it, drugs in the body can enter oral fluid, the saliva, through passive diffusion from blood or may be deposited in the oral cavity during oral, smoke or intranasal administration. So, indeed, drug metabolites also can be detected in saliva. That is one.\n",
      "Then, the saliva test, I have shown you earlier: you need to swab a person's tongue, using the test kit to obtain minute sample of saliva. So, the test kit subsequently will check the saliva for controlled drugs and produces results in about eight to 10 minutes. So, it is quite fast. It is similar to the COVID-19 test kits where the test kit will produce red lines if particular drugs are present. So, it is quick, efficient, fast.\n",
      "Nevertheless, we will also have a double check. That means, if we find that there are some test results which are positive, we will bring them back to do further testing.\n",
      "The Chairman: Mr Raj Joshua Thomas.\n",
      "Mr Raj Joshua Thomas: Thank you, Mdm Chair. I thank the Minister of State for her response on my question of regularising security officers' working hours. And I understand her response is that the Government has implemented security outcome-based contracts (OBCs) for all of their security contracts.\n",
      "My clarification is whether, in precisely these security OBCs, whether the Government can implement higher weightage for bid proposals that propose shorter working hours? For security officers for two reasons: first, it has been shown that when security officers work shorter hours, they are operationally more effective, which is an outcome in and of itself; and the second is to support the overall effort to better the working conditions of our outsourced workers.\n",
      "Ms Sun Xueling: I thank the Member for his question. We share the same sentiment. We want to improve the working hours, the working conditions for our security officers.\n",
      "So, what we are trying to do now is that we want to work with stakeholders to look at outcome-based driven approaches and we do know that actually, the industry needs time to also develop expertise, because we are talking about a better match between manpower with technology and also with the solutions that are available.\n",
      "We will take into account the suggestion that the Member has made. We will go back and look into it and see how the Government agencies can further drive initiatives on this front.\n",
      "The Chairman: Mr Christopher de Souza.\n",
      "Mr Christopher de Souza: Thank you, Madam. I thank Minister of State Sun for the response and thank you for clarifying that there is a \"kill switch\" option on the part of the consumer. May I humbly propose that the \"kill switch\" option or power, also be bestowed on the banks? Because, in the example that Minister of State Sun provided, which is actually consistent with the example that was given to me by the residents who spoke with me, was that: from one account, it goes to six accounts, it goes to 36 accounts and carries on.\n",
      "5.30 pm\n",
      "So, if that algorithm or pattern is recognised by the bank internally, then my humble question is, ought not the bank then be given the power to \"kill switch\" the transmission of monies from accounts to accounts, without the incumbency being on the consumer, on the customer, but the bank itself. Could that be considered? \n",
      "Ms Sun Xueling: I thank the Member for his supplementary question. As I mentioned, the seven major retail banks are co-located with each other and the sole purpose is to be able to exchange information quickly, once they are aware that a scam has occurred, that the victim has lost money. The seven major retail banks are working closely together, together with the SPF, to provide standby services 24/7 and they aim to freeze accounts within an hour. So, we definitely try to do so.\n",
      "But the reason I actually use the example was to demonstrate the complexity. Because of the proliferation of the number of bank accounts that are being created by money mules who are negligent in the way they have given up control of their bank accounts or some have given up their Singpass IDs to allow others to set up bank accounts, many of these bank accounts are being used to launder these proceeds. And the banks do need time to be able to trace the monies and activate the \"kill switch\", as you say so.\n",
      "This is something that the banks are working on. The banks are working closely with the SPF to do that within an hour, to freeze the accounts so that there is a higher chance that we can prevent the monies from going out of the system, that we can return those monies to the victims.\n",
      "The Chairman: Mr Vikram Nair. \n",
      "Mr Vikram Nair: I just want to pick up on the point on international scams. I do not know whether it is Minister or the Senior Minister of State, but the number of scams that are routed internationally, what percentage would that be and how effective are we in capturing these and recovering proceeds? I think you mentioned a number of about 70 people have been arrested, but what percentage is that of the bigger pool?\n",
      "Ms Sun Xueling: Based on the numbers I have, more than 90% of scam cases that we know of originated from overseas. Like I have mentioned in my main reply, we work closely with foreign law enforcement agencies, but there are many operational challenges.\n",
      "Not all foreign law enforcement agencies conduct their operations the way we do. They may face very specific challenges in their home countries, cities or villages. And that is something that we do not have control over. But where we can, it is definitely our desire to work with the foreign law enforcement agencies and after they find out who the perpetrators are, they conduct those raids, they inform us. Sometimes, they are able to recover some portion of the scam proceeds. Because you can imagine that the scam proceeds actually move very quickly in the system, even if you were to trace them to Country A which was where the scam proceeds first go to, you never know how those scam proceeds then find its way to other countries or to other parts of the banking system. Or they may even have been changed into non-cash proceeds, for instance.\n",
      "So, I would just like to share with the Member that definitely we work with foreign law enforcement agencies, but we have to be mindful that there are operational challenges and that even when they are able to recover some portion of the scam proceeds, there are actually many, many claimants to those scam proceeds. And so, there is some difficulty to be able to return those monies in its totality to the victim.\n",
      "The Chairman: Mr Murali, would you like to withdraw your amendment? \n",
      "Mr Murali Pillai: Mdm Chairperson, with your indulgence, I would like to thank the hon members who filed 27 cuts spanning 52.5 minutes on various topics that made this debate quite enriching. But I also would like to extend my appreciation to hon Second Minister and the two hon Ministers of State for their responses and outlining their strategies to keep Singapore safe and secure.

       "['Order read for the Resumption of Debate on Question [17 April 2023].\\n\"That the following Address in reply to the Speech of the President be agreed to:\\n\\'We, the Parliament of the Republic of Singapore, express our thanks to the President for the Speech which she delivered on behalf of the Government at the Opening of the Second Session of this Parliament.\\'.\" â [Mr Murali Pillai]\\nQuestion again proposed.\\nMr Speaker: Mr Murali Pillai.\\n12.33 pm\\nMr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok): Mr Speaker, Sir, I seek a clarification of a response given by the hon Member Mr Leon Perera to Minister Ong Ye Kung yesterday. \\nAs may be recalled, the hon Member Mr Perera mentioned, in relation to the GST, that the Workers\\' Party (WP) accepted the GST at 7% and conveyed this in 2018. My interest is that I actually spoke about the WP position from 1993 when the GST Bill was being introduced all the way to date, and I checked the Hansard. \\nSo, I would like to seek clarification from the hon Member as to when and where this position of the WP was articulated.\\nMr Speaker: Mr Perera.\\nMr Leon Perera (Aljunied): I thank the hon Member Mr Murali Pillai for that question. What I had said and I will repeat that here, is that if you go back to those debates in Parliament in 2018, we opposed a hike of GST from 7% to 9%. At no point in that debate did we call for the GST to be lowered from 7% to 0%.\\n Mr Pillai makes reference to positions that were articulated by the WP in the 1990s. I do not know whether it is fair to bring up positions that were taken in the 1990s and have a debate about that. By the same token, I could bring up positions that the People\\'s Action Party (PAP) has taken in the 1990s and table that for discussion here, such as the Graduate Mother\\'s Policy, such as votes for upgrading, for example.\\n So, I think the point here is that at no point since the idea of a GST hike from 7% to 9% was first mooted and put on the table here in Parliament, which is in 2018 as I recall, at no point did anyone in the WP call for the GST to be lowered from 7% to 0%. And if there is anyone or if there is any evidence or reference that the Member can make, for anyone in the WP making that specific call, then we would be glad to discuss that. \\nMr Speaker: Mr Pillai. \\nMr Murali Pillai: I thank the hon Member Mr Perera for clarifying that the acceptance of the stance of GST being at 7% is to be implied from the fact that in 2018, when it was proposed by the Government to increase the GST from 7% to 9%, the WP did not ask for a reduction of the percentage. \\nJust on a point of elucidation, GST was not being increased for the first time in 2018. It was actually being increased progressively from 3% to 4% to 5%. And, in around 2007, it was increased from 5% to 7%. So, I take it that as far as my learned friend, or rather, the hon Member Mr Perera is concerned, this implicit decision to accept GST was made in 2018 when the Government conveyed its decision to propose an increase of GST from 7% to 9%. And if that is the case, then I think we have a happy situation because the gulf, or the gap, between the WP and the PAP is now narrowed from 9% to now 2%.\\nMr Speaker: Mr Perera.\\nMr Leon Perera: I thank the hon Member for his statements and, just to reiterate, when this idea of GST was mooted, we did not call for any reduction of the GST rate from 7% to 0%. So, that is, indeed, the position, and that would be borne out if you go back to those debates from 2018 until now.\\n I would again remind the Member with respect that if we are to bring up policy positions that have been taken decades ago and table them for debate, then I think the policies of the PAP from decades ago should also be put here and tabled for debate as well. \\nBut I do not think that that would be constructive because everyone evolves their position as conditions evolve. And I think for us in the WP, and it may be the same for the PAP, whenever we have to make a decision on whether to take a position on a policy, you look at all the options that are there on the table and you decide what is in the best interest of the country, what is rational, what is fact-based, and you take a position at that point in time on that particular issue. But I thank the Member for his comments.\\nMr Speaker: Mr Pillai.  \\nMr Murali Pillai: I thank again Mr Perera for his answers. And maybe, Your Honour, if I could clarify, my interest in relation to raising the position of the WP from the 1990s is, with respect, not unfair because what we need is clarity on where the WP â and, for that reason, any party â stands on important issues. \\nSo, if it, indeed, had evolved, then it will be incumbent on any party to then make that position very clear, so that the public understands where the parties are on these important issues.\\nMr Speaker: I am honoured, Mr Murali. But this is not a Court. Mr Dennis Tan.\\n12.38 pm\\nMr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang): Mr Speaker, I support the Motion of Thanks to the President for her address during the Opening of the second session of the 14th Parliament.\\nMr Speaker, we read in the news this week that the Certificate of Entitlement (COE) premium for smaller cars crossed the $100,000 mark to reach a record high of $103,721. New records were also set in the larger car and open categories at $120,889 and $124,501 respectively. And I read that the latter is the highest price ever posted for any category of COEs.\\nThe President of the Singapore Vehicle Traders Association, Mr Neo Tiam Ting, told The Straits Times that the companies that are supplying cars for ride hailing services are a key driver behind the demand for COEs in recent years. He said that these companies which grow their fleets aggressively and pushed up COE premiums in the process are able to pass on the higher cost in the form of relatively small increases in daily rental rates while private buyers have to stomach the premium hike in one go with a bigger loan.\\nThis is not a new issue and I am aware that the Government stated in a Parliamentary Question reply to my colleague, the hon Louis Chua, last year that there is no evidence that PHC companies have caused the increase in COE prices. Be that as it may, as prices spiral out of reach of many Singaporeans who aspire or need to buy a car for different reasons, can we not do more to review how we can ensure that businesses, whether ride-hailing companies, car leasing companies or car dealers, do not push up the COE premiums at the peril of private buyers who need to buy a car for various different reasons.\\nSuch reasons can include using their vehicles for work purposes, taking care of their families with young children, taking care of elderly family members or handicapped family members. For some of these people, operating a private hire car from a ride-hailing company or using Grab or taxis may somehow not be a suitable substitute.\\nCan we also see to it that COEs for commercial vehicles are not subject to similar pressures? The rising COEs for this Category C have contributed to rising business costs and present further challenges for our smaller businesses. And added business costs also contribute to the increase in cost of living for everyone.\\nIn the past week, when we have been talking about combating stratification and building social compact amidst rising costs of living and rising property prices, we should be wary of the possible social effects of spiralling COE prices.\\nMr Speaker, I welcome and support the Minister for Transport\\'s statement in the addendum to the President\\'s Address, that the Ministry of Transport (MOT) will further encourage the adoption of cleaner energy vehicles through regulation, incentives and infrastructure. Indeed, President Halimah stated in her address that we have committed to decisive action to reduce carbon emissions and are taking resolute steps towards meeting our net-zero commitments.\\nThe Minister also said that we will review financial incentives to encourage the adoption of electric cars and monitor related developments in other vehicle segments, such as motorcycles and goods vehicles. To date, the pricing of electric vehicles is still relatively unattractive, compared to internal combustible engine (ICE) vehicles. I agree that the Government should further review to see how we are better able to encourage and incentivise more people to switch to Electric Vehicles (EVs) and reducing the number of new ICE vehicles on the road.\\nMr Speaker, a recent CNA article dated 11 April 2023 reported that parallel importers face limits in what EVs they can put on the road as compared to the authorised dealers, as this is partly because of how road tax is calculated, which is pegged to the EV\\'s power rating. One importer reported encountering problems with the homologation and/or registration for EVs. It was also reported that EV models with dual electric motors require proper documentation from manufacturers that confirm their power rating and this makes it tougher for parallel importers to register these cars for road use as, unlike authorised dealers, they do not have direct contact with the car makers. Another importer stated that EV options are quite limited for parallel importers and they hope for, I quote, \"better support in terms of clarity on importing rules\".\\nI hope the Government can look into the concerns of these parallel importers to clarify and review the rules and documentary requirements for EV sales and registrations, which may be more disadvantageous to parallel importers. More importantly, I hope the Government can provide more assistance to parallel importers to encourage them to focus on getting higher volumes of EV sales as opposed to ICE vehicles.\\nMr Speaker, still on transition to EVs, I next move to the issue of the electrification of logistics vehicles. In my Budget debate speech in February this year, I expressed my concern that it remains unclear how soon certain logistics fleets, including but not limited to light goods vehicles, will be switching to EVs entirely and I said that a number of prominent logistics companies have not yet had any plans or have not announced any plans for EV conversion or some have preliminary plans for only limited initial conversion.\\nIndeed, I have brought up my concerns for the green transition in last-mile logistics and asking for our plans for conversion of goods and logistics vehicles variously in the Committee of Supply (COS) Debate 2022 with the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, and during the debate for the EV Charging Bill in November 2022. In the MOT COS debate last month, I also asked whether the Government will actively engage logistics companies directly on their plans to convert to EVs and to speed up the process.\\nSenior Minister of State Amy Khor replied that, and I quote: \"on logistics companies\\' transition to cleaner vehicles, we are working with them, but it is now limited by the availability of this kind of vehicles in terms of technology\".\\nSir, during the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE)\\'s COS debate in 2022, I have already said that we have also seen electric light commercial vehicle models increasingly being rolled out by manufacturers, such as Renault, Opel and BYD. More recently, we read that, in the US, Schneider has delivered its first short-haul logistics EV trucks while Tesla has also delivered EV trucks to PepsiCo.\\nMr Speaker, while I appreciate MOT\\'s efforts to engage our logistics companies in this area thus far and, admittedly, some manufacturers may have only started to build such electric commercial vehicles not too long ago. I hope the MOT will increase its engagement with logistics companies to persuade them to have step plans for the conversions. I hope MOT will have a dedicated roadmap on the conversion of the logistics and goods vehicle fleet operating in Singapore in the next few years and will work closely together with logistics companies on such a roadmap.\\nMr Speaker, during the EV Charging Bill debate in November last year, I also mentioned that we have a large number of goods vehicles which are coming from Malaysia on a daily basis. I hope the Government will have a plan to handle this large group of foreign ICE vehicles coming into Singapore and travelling all over Singapore every day even if this may take even more time, given that they are foreign vehicles. Yes, we may need the goods and supplies these goods vehicles bring in every day, but it will be good to know that the Government has a plan in respect of these vehicles even if it may involve foreign government or agencies. We should not let their emissions delay our zero emission goals indefinitely.\\nMr Speaker, I also like to congratulate MOT and Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) for the launch of the first electric ferry, the Penguin Refresh on Monday, to carry Shell workers, contractors and visitors between Shell\\'s Pulau Bukom premises and Pasir Panjang Ferry Terminal.\\nIt is also commendable that MPA is working with Shell to allow other electric harbour craft to access their electric charges in due course. This is a first big step in the decarbonisation of the harbour craft fleet in the Port of Singapore. Under MPA\\'s maritime decarbonisation blueprint working towards 2050, all harbour craft will operate on low carbon energy solutions such as blended biofuels, for example, the B100 fuel or hybrid diesel electric propulsion by 2030 and by 2050 will operate on full electric propulsion of net zero fuels in order to achieve 15% reduction of 2021 levels by 2030 and 50% of 2021 levels by 2050.\\nI support these plans and I hope we can achieve the targets ahead of time.\\nIn the course of my professional work over the years, I had to use harbour launches to board vessels lying in nearby anchorages over the years and I hope the familiar smell of the engine fuel of the old harbour launches will be a thing of the past. In fact, I can remember in the past, I would have to pick one of the many harbour launches lying alongside Clifford Pier, effectively like water taxis and the pierced smelling of the fumes.\\nMr Speaker, while it is noteworthy that Shell estimates that it can save more than 6,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year, the ferry operation is far from being the mainstay of Shell\\'s business.\\nIn my Budget debate\\'s speech on 2022, I mentioned that Shell had in November 2021 announced that it was halving its crude processing capacity at its Singapore hub and reducing fuel exports. The oil major, a major part of our oil and gas industry, is intending to transit from fossil fuels to cut emissions and meet global low carbon energy needs. I acknowledge that this is part of a wider global trend in a transition towards low carbon fuels and undoubtedly, will affect Singapore in some ways.\\nMr Speaker, I hope the Government will continue to update the House on the transformation of our petrochemical sector on a green transition process in this sector, whether Singapore will continue to attract and retain parts of the petrochemical industry in Singapore. They are relevant for the green economy. I hope the Government will provide updates on our efforts in attracting more businesses in areas like biofuel refining or sustainable aviation fuel production or storage for such fuels as well as updates on carbon capture and sequestration at petrochemical plants.\\nAnd finally, I hope the Government will continue to update the House on the just transition in manpower for our workers working in Shell and other companies in the petrochemical sector, what we are doing to retain and retrain workers in this sector as the sector transforms within Singapore. Mr Speaker, I support the Motion of thanks to the President.\\nMr Speaker: Mr Pritam Singh.\\n12.49 pm\\nMr Pritam Singh (Aljunied): Mr Speaker, the Government\\'s direction as encapsulated by the President\\'s Address continues in the same vein from the last term of Parliament. A significant part of the information contained in the addenda to the President\\'s Address has been made known previously even before Parliament was prorogued. The WP Members of Parliament (MPs) have therefore raised issues that remain at the top of the public mind, such as HDB matters, the cost of living issues that affect seniors and the young and matters of fairness and inclusivity.\\nFor my part, I will cover three broad points.\\nFirst, I will speak about foreigners in Singapore and restate my call to the Government to ensure that our foreign talent policies translate to tangible benefits for Singaporeans.\\nSecondly, I will revisit my call for proficiency in English as a requirement for new Permanent Residents (PRs) and new citizens.\\nThird, I will address the Deputy Prime Minister\\'s remarks on the WP as an opposition that seeks to chip away at the people\\'s trust in Government. I will also address the Deputy Prime Minister\\'s questions to the WP concerning the Goods and Services Tax and list several policy proposals made by the WP, which have been adopted by the Government.\\nFirst, foreigners in Singapore. WP MPs know from our engagement with the public that a unique Singapore identity â proud and distinctive â has formed but continues to evolve. Insofar as a new social compact is concerned, Singaporeans seek a fairer, more inclusive and more caring society. The Government recognises this and my colleagues have signposted areas where these objectives can be operationalised.\\nIn his addendum, the Minister in-charge of the Strategy Group under the Prime Minister\\'s Office, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence has committed to carefully manage foreign worker and immigration flows to ensure that these translate into tangible benefits for Singaporeans and separately, to help newcomers integrate better into society.\\nWith respect to tangible benefits for Singaporeans, the WP has made that specific point repeatedly and we continue to see it as an important requirement to ensure society remains welcoming of foreigners. \\nThe WP has also made calls for a report card on the Industry Transformation Maps and job outcomes for Singaporeans. The publication of outcome-based indicators of Government policies would be useful tools in ensuring continued public support or at least understanding of the Government\\'s foreign talent policies. Providing evidence of how foreign talent policies help Singaporeans in concrete ways will help prevent xenophobia, something we must always guard against.\\nTo this end, it is useful for me to restate the point the WP made on the Parliamentary debate on free trade agreements and the India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) in September 2021, a point that Minister Ong Ye Kung brought up yesterday. As that debate proved, getting the People\\'s Action Party (PAP) Government to reveal information on the number of intra-corporate transferees from India that worked in Singapore upon the introduction of CECA was like squeezing blood out of a stone.\\nParliamentary questions had been filed by the WP on the issue from 2016 but forthright answers were not forthcoming. In the meantime, pressures and tensions on the ground built up as a small number of Singaporeans became emotionally charged about CECA, using it as an adjective and in very uncharitable and downright racist ways. The WP sought information, answers to which could have shed light and reduced heat before things reached a boiling point. Unlike as suggested by Minister Ong yesterday, sometimes filing a parliamentary question does not guarantee receiving an adequate and substantive answer from the PAP Government from which alternatives can germinate.\\nMoving forward another potential tinder box that the Government should look at closely is the growth of family offices, inflows of foreign wealth and how Singaporeans are taking to these developments. There are already murmurings of discontent that are led by emotional perspectives, created by facts such as the mass buying spree of properties in single developments by foreigners. If the Government does not step in early and fill the information vacuum on how outcomes for Singapore and Singaporeans are enhanced, this subject may turn ugly too and it would be important for the Government to be on top of this.\\nIn future, the PAP must not see calls for information as a Trojan horse for ulterior motives or a red herring. When there are requests for detailed figures, the PAP must not turn defensive in response to the Parliamentary Opposition of the day playing its role checking the Government of the day.\\nIn moving this Motion, MP Mr Murali Pillai stated that we must recognise that the nature of the electorate is changing and today, a new generation is emerging â standing taller and brighter than the ones before. He also said, and I quote, \"People\\'s psyche will change and as they do, the Government must change to a degree and at a speed unprecedented.\" Likewise, the interventions of the Opposition in this House, the questions it asks and the proposals it advances must reflect this new psyche.\\nGoing forward, the 4G PAP Leadership cannot be dismissive or breezily use national security or sensitivity as reasons for withholding information without good reason. In fact, I foresee that a greater openness to releasing information will be fundamental to the refreshed social compact that the 4G Leadership seeks to forge with Singaporeans through the Forward Singapore exercise. \\nOn the point of the Prime Minister\\'s Office\\'s Strategy Group\\'s addendum covering better integration of newcomers into society, I had proposed an English requirement for PRs and citizenship applications in last month\\'s Committee of Supply debate. A few weeks later, in a demographically representative poll of 500 Singapore-born citizens aged between 18 and 69, a CNA MediaCorp survey reported on 3 April this year, this month by CNA found that almost 80% were in favour of an English test for new PRs and citizens.\\nPrior to the release of the survey result, in some limited quarters, the proposal for an English requirement was incorrectly understood as a divisive one with the implicit point being that mother tongue languages would somehow be compromised or that an English requirement was actually a test for \"Singaporeaness\". But these criticisms missed the key point of the proposal, which was focused on integration. I am gratified that the demographically representative survey respondents did not miss the point.\\nThe wide support for an English requirement, as shown by the survey, can perhaps be traced to the historical use of English in Singapore, as established by the Pioneer Generation of PAP leaders. In the 2012 publication, Singapore\\'s Bilingual Journey, the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew said, and I quote, \"When Singapore celebrated its 21st National Day on the 9th of August 1986, it also celebrated a different sort of milestone. It was the first-time emcees of the event used English to lead the audience, where before they had to use three languages â Mandarin, Malay and Tamil. The crowds, likewise, responded in English. Where before the different races in Singapore were like different tanks of fish in an aquarium together before your eyes but segregated from one another, now they have a common language linking them together. They still retained their mother tongues whether Chinese, Malay or Tamil? But a common knowledge of English enabled them to share together the joys of the occasion. I was a proud man that day.\"\\nOn the occasion of the 100th year of his birth, this year, those words of the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew are timely. The late Prime Minister was clear. English would be a functional language with which to access the knowledge of the world and a tool for survival. The mother tongue is the cultural language used to transmit the culture\\'s traditional values. More than three decades since his words in 1986, Singaporeans understand that immigration is necessary to top up our population but they also instinctively appreciate the importance of a lingua franca for better integration with newcomers and the signal it sends of Singapore as a multi-racial and multicultural nation not just in form, but in substance. So, no one should be surprised at advocacy for our lingua franca, namely English, to bind Singaporeans together. At the same time, however, we must never sever our cultural roots. All of us must remain proud and celebrate our individual cultures, including our mother tongues.\\nOne legitimate concern, however, is the possible difficulty of an English requirement for foreign spouses who apply for PR or citizenship. Sir, WP â in its 2020 manifesto â called for the fast-track naturalisation of foreign spouses on the Long-Term Visit Pass Plus (LVTP+), subject to certain conditions, such as having at least one Singaporean child. I would suggest that an English requirement for foreign spouses can be one of the criteria for fast-tracking these applicants. My proposal calls for, all other things being equal, that additional points or consideration be given for PR and citizenship to foreign spouses who have a working proficiency in English. As the Government has openly stated, our immigration policy and immigration intake is calibrated to preserve the racial balance and by extension, an English requirement would not favour one racial group over another just because applicants in one racial group already use English and the other does not. \\nSir, a fast-track for foreign spouses would give families in Singapore with one Singaporean spouse much peace of mind. In effect, for foreign spouses, the English requirement would serve as a plus one criteria or bonus criteria. It would nudge and better align immigration policy with our bilingualism policy, which is a fundamental aspect of the Singapore system. For the record, this WP proposal does not contradict any of the eight principles of Singapore\\'s bilingualism policy established by the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew.\\nMr Speaker, the Singaporean identity continues to mature. For a young nation, this is a positive force. One that instinctively drives us towards inclusivity. It is wholly consistent with the values professed by the Government\\'s agenda that seeks, and I quote, \"a deepening of Singaporeans\\' sense of shared identity and mutual responsibility towards one another\".\\nI hope the Government can explore the best ways to reinforce the importance of English as a common language in our daily life, as it makes a big difference to the lived experience of many Singaporeans. The signalling effect on the centrality of our multiracial and multicultural society is immense. \\nSir, let me move on to my third point. I did not expect the Deputy Prime Minister to use his speech on the President\\'s Address to attack and accuse the WP of advancing opportunistic or populist ideas to chip away, bit by bit, the trust in Government. The PAP shifted its position yesterday in the course of the debate. when Minister Ong Ye Kung conceded that the WP have brought up many good ideas. But both Ministers were consistent in calling for the Opposition to present an alternative agenda and even an alternative Budget. I will deal with this point in the course of my speech.\\nTo address Deputy Prime Minister Wong, if all we were doing was putting forward populist, unrealistic policies, we would not see the Government actively considering some variation of the WP manifesto ideas on anti-discrimination legislation, minimum wage and redundancy insurance. If chipping away at trust in the Government was our real agenda, we would not see the Minister for National Development (MND) acknowledging the WP point highlighting the inherent inequity of the Housing and Development Board (HDB) taxpayer subsidies as currently applied between mature and non-mature Build-to-Order (BTO) flats.\\nIt is a most unfair charge levelled at the WP which, in reality, chips away at the integrity of our Parliamentary democracy as an important platform for the exposition and contestation of ideas. In fact, we welcome the PAP taking up WP points because the real beneficiaries are not the WP or the PAP â but the people of Singapore. \\nMr Speaker, please allow me to list just a few of our policy proposals to demolish this idea that the WP has not put forward serious alternatives. \\nNumber one, verifying educational qualifications of Employment Pass (EP) holders. In our 2020 General Election manifesto, we called for the introduction of Employment Pass credentials assessment. We said that all Employment Pass and S Pass job applicants with university degrees and diplomas should be subject to mandatory educational credentials assessments, with cost to be borne by the applicant. On 1 March this year, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) announced that companies in Singapore would need to verify the educational qualifications of Employment Pass applicants from 1 September 2023.\\nNumber two, broadcast Parliamentary Sittings live. In our 2020 and 2015 General Election manifestos, we called for the live, unedited broadcasts of Parliamentary Sittings. From 4 January 2021, Singaporeans were able to view livestreamed sessions of Parliament.\\nNumber three, national hydrogen strategy. Aljunied Group Representation Constituency (GRC) Member of Parliament (MP) Gerald Giam called for a national renewable hydrogen strategy in Parliament in January 2022 during the Motion on a low carbon society and again during Budget 2020. On 25 October the same year, the Energy Market Authority (EMA) announced that Singapore was launching a national hydrogen strategy to accelerate the transition to net zero emissions and to strengthen energy security.\\nNumber four, equalised maternity leave of 16 weeks for single unwed mothers. In our 2011 and 2015 General Election manifestos, we called for equitable support for single parents. In our 2011 manifesto, we stated that while having children outside of marriage should continue to be discouraged in our society, children born to single parents should not be denied the benefits that children of married parents receive. The children are innocent parties and should not start life being disadvantaged. We said that single parents should receive the same parenthood benefit packages as married parents.\\nIn our 2015 manifesto, we reiterate our call to grant single and wet mothers the full 16 weeks of paid maternity leave. In addition, we argue that single mothers should be made eligible for both the Working Mother\\'s Child Relief (WCMR) as well as the Foreign Domestic Worker Levy (FDWL) relief. Excluding single mothers from these schemes unnecessarily penalises vulnerable children and single mothers. We added that the Government should extend the same help to single fathers. On 9 November 2016, the Government announced that from January 2017, unmarried mothers would have 16 weeks of paid maternity leave, equal to their married counterparts and fathers would have two weeks of paid paternity leave.\\nNumber five, BTO priority and forfeiture for non-selection. In our 2015 General Election manifesto, we called for the \"three-tries BTO\". We proposed that first-timer BTO applicants on the fiancÃ©-fiancÃ©e scheme be given priority up to their third try in selecting a flat so as to minimise the waiting time for couples to buy a flat and plan for starting a family. We called for the priority to be forfeited if the first timer BTO applicants were invited to select a flat in any one of their previous tries but did not book a flat.\\nOn 2 March this year, the Government announced that first-time BTO applicants who give up their chance to select a flat would lose their priority status. From the August 2023 BTO exercise, first timers who fail to choose a flat once will be deemed second timers for a year in the computer ballot. Second timers who accumulate one non-selection count, down from the current two counts, will have to wait one year before they can apply for flat again.\\nNumber six, impose a charge for the use of plastic bags. In our 2020 General Election manifesto on curbing the use of plastics, we called for the introduction of a single-use plastic charge, phased in over five years to encourage a reduction in plastic waste while looking for alternatives. This is what we said: the value of the charge would need to be sufficiently high to change behaviours but remains sensitive to the needs of lower socioeconomic groups and persons with disabilities. We called for a nationwide public education campaign to raise awareness of the effects of single-use plastics and other more sustainable alternatives. On 2 March this year, the Government announced a plastic charge at most Singapore supermarkets from 3 July 2023, with two-thirds of all supermarkets imposing a charge of at least five cents for each carrier bag.\\nNumber seven, one family paired to one General Practitioner (GP). In our 2015 General Election manifesto seven years ago, the WP called for the family doctor pairing scheme. We argue that pairing families with GPs would encourage patients to remain with one family doctor who would be more familiar with their background and medical history. This would facilitate earlier detection of illnesses, provide more accurate diagnosis, reduce duplication of treatment and improve coordination with other care providers. We proposed all resident families be paired with a GP near their home and that Singaporeans could be given the option to change their assigned GP. \\nIn October 2022, this House debated the Healthier SG White Paper, which among other things put forward the Government\\'s proposal for one family physician and one health plan for everyone. Under the plan, each resident chooses the family doctor or clinic. Flexibility will be provided for residents to change their enrolled doctor if they need to do so.\\nNumber eight, flexible work arrangements. In our 2015 General Election manifesto seven years ago again, the WP called for the fair regulation of mandatory flexi-work arrangements, where companies should be obliged to cater for a work-life friendly environment for workers. We suggested that employees who work for a company with more than 20 employees for more than six months should be allowed to make requests for flexible working arrangements. Employers could refuse the request on reasonable business grounds but must discuss the options available with the employee. The discussion must be duly documented and employees may appeal the refusal if there is a dispute on the grounds for refusing a request. \\nWe also called for tax breaks and enhanced work-life grants to be made widely available to help companies accommodate the flexi-work arrangements relevant to their respective industries. In the course of this debate no less, Minister of State Gan Siow Huang has reiterated that to entrench flexible work arrangements, MOM and the Tripartite Partners will introduce a set of tripartite guidelines by 2024. The guidelines would require employers to consider requests for flexible work arrangements fairly and properly. \\nSir, this is a non-exhaustive listing of the WP\\'s alternative proposals. \\nThere are of course proposals that were long advanced by the WP MPs, for example, on criminal legal aid which was strenuously rejected by the PAP. For example, on criminal legal aid, the PAP\\'s long-standing position was that it could not accept the taxpayer simultaneously funding both the prosecution and criminal defence. But they shifted positions and criminal legal aid finally became a reality in the last session of Parliament. \\nWhen the WP raised the matter of anti-discrimination laws and redundancy insurance, the PAP similarly offered many reasons why it could not be done then or were unmoved and not persuaded, only to shift its position later and take up the suggestion. \\nOne specific point which the Deputy Prime Minister reopened in this debate was the GST and the WP\\'s approach to it. This is rather strange because the debate over the last few years has been about the GST hike and not the GST per se.\\nEven so, as the Deputy Prime Minister spoke on Monday, I wondered why the Deputy Prime Minister would want to raise the GST question at this debate because those questions ought to have come during the Budget debate. Had the question on the WP position on the GST per se been asked then, the answer would have been obvious. The WP policy positions cannot be immutable and have to evolve with the political realities of the time. We may not have supported the GST when it was first introduced decades ago but we recognise it as part of the system. But accepting the GST as it stands does not mean accepting every GST hike put forward by the Government. \\nThe WP went into the last general elections opposing the hike in the GST. We did not ask for the removal of the GST completely since the GST has been an endemic feature about tax system for many years now. At least from the time I entered this House, the WP\\'s position concerned the necessity of GST hikes because the GST hurts the poor and middle class the hardest.\\nMr Speaker, Singaporeans know that no GST offset package lasts forever. Singaporeans are also acutely aware that a 1% increase in GST this year does not mean that the prices of goods and services will only rise by 1%. As we all know, for the men and women on the street the rise can be compounded many times, especially for basic things. Even with the Government\\'s newly enhanced permanent GSTV scheme in 2022 by MOF\\'s own reckoning, for low-income households who do not have elderly members, the GSTV scheme will offset about half of their total GST expenses. \\nI am aware that in February this year, the GSTV cash component of the GSTV scheme was increased by up to $350. However, I have not been able to find an MOF statement that sets out in parallel how much this increase will offset the total GST expenses for a low-income family without elderly members.\\nSir, the WP\\'s view is that if there are options to stave off this 1% or 2% rise in GST to fend off concomitant price rises in basic things like food at the coffee shop or hawker centre for the men and women on the street, as a responsible Opposition that has the welfare of Singaporeans at heart, the WP has to ask â why not consider them? And debate them? That is what we must be expected to do in this House rather than just accept whatever the PAP says.\\nThe Deputy Prime Minister does not want the WP to relitigate the alternative ideas we raised to make up the GST hike by saying that the sums do not add up. I believe when he says this, he means the sums do not add up if you want to remove the GST completely.\\nBut the Deputy Prime Minister would be acutely aware that this House was never debating the total removal of the GST in the last session of the Parliament, nor have we been doing so as long as the Deputy Prime Minister has been in this House.\\nThis is a distraction and the PAP should be upfront about it since we have been clearly talking about the GST hike from 7% to 9%, and what alternatives there are for it. \\nI would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether the Government still intends to proceed with the GST hike from 8% to 9% next year or whether it would consider a pause in view of persisting inflationary and cost of living pressures; and secondly, to accommodate changes to our corporate tax receipts that will inevitably crystalise further in the wake of BEPS 2.0. This is especially since the Government has announced at this year\\'s Budget that it would implement a domestic top-up tax that will raise multinational enterprise groups\\' effective tax rate in Singapore to 15% in 2025 â less than two years from now.\\nShould the corporate tax revenues look respectable and sustainable for the short to medium term without any real compromise in our attractiveness to foreign investors, it may not be necessary to introduce another hike to the GST from 8% to 9% for 2024, if corporate tax revenue, which contribute 25% of our tax revenues today, goes up further.\\nSir, the WP\\'s interventions, including our proposals of alternatives to the GST hike, seek better outcomes for Singaporeans. If our agenda was rank opportunism or populism, as suggested by the Deputy Prime Minister, the people will reject our brand of politics. \\nBut many Singaporeans do not want the cause of the Opposition in Singapore to fail and instinctively recognise the importance of a rational, responsible and respectable political Opposition in this House. \\nFor that reason, the public expectations of the outcomes in General Elections are not necessarily in synchrony with Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong\\'s point that every election from now will be about who forms the government.\\nWhat the Deputy Prime Minister is true in a theoretical sense. The elections are about who forms the government. But as the PAP itself likes to tout, Singapore is unique. The political reality in the Singaporean context â a combination of the first-past-the-post system, the size and footprint of Opposition parties, certain grassroots organisations\\' manned by PAP apparatchiks and an Electoral Boundaries Review Committee that comes under the Prime Minister\\'s Office, amongst other factors â all these reveal that the real prospect for a change of government during General Elections today, conceals the advantage of the PAP\\'s incumbency far more than the Deputy Prime Minister cares to let Singaporeans in on.\\nThe Deputy Prime Minister has asked us to be honest about our plans, policies and intentions. On the heady dreams of displacing the PAP and forming the government, the reality is the WP is a small party and we have a long way to go. Our medium-term objective is to ensure that one third of the seats in this House are not in the PAP\\'s hands. I said this in 2018 in a speech to WP\\'s members, which is publicly available under the \"Key Speeches\" section of the Office of the Leader of the Opposition website, and this was reported by the mainstream media.\\nWhy the significance of this figure of one-third and why is it important?\\nThe Constitution â the highest law of our land â which all other laws must take reference from, can only be changed if two-thirds of the MPs in this House agree. Should any political party with more than two thirds of the seats in this House decide to change the Constitution arbitrarily, there is nothing that can be done to stop them. \\nToday, the PAP does not just have a two-third majority, it has a supermajority of more than 75% of the seats. If we exclude Nominated MPs who cannot vote on constitutional changes, the total denominator is 93 elected MPs and two Non-constituency MPs. That brings the PAP\\'s supermajority at close to 90% today.\\nWe are not playing \"masak masak\" when we make changes to the Constitution. These are serious matters that involve the lives of Singaporeans to a very acute degree. In order to pass a constitutional amendment with a two-third majority, the PAP needs 63 votes in this House. The PAP has 83 MPs today. The PAP can even change the entire Constitution at one go, with 20 MPs to spare.\\nLet me give an illustration of how and why these numbers are important.\\nOn 21 March this year, just last month â in fact, exactly one month ago â the Parliament passed amendments to the Constitution. Some of the changes included amendments to Article 9, that sought to ensure that laws relating to the misuse of drugs that authorise the arrest and detention of any person for treatment and rehabilitation, remain valid under the Constitution. A separate change involved the introduction of a legal mechanism to reduce the balance of the Contingencies Fund so as to maintain discipline in how the Government manages its finances.\\nUnbeknownst to many members of the public and voters, there were only 67 MPs in the House present when that constitutional amendment was passed on 21 March last month. These 67 MPs included seven WP MPs.\\nIf all the WP MPs had not been present in the House at the time of the vote, the Constitution could not have been amended as sought by the PAP as only 60 PAP MPs were present. \\nI want to emphasise that the WP\\'s intention is not to block all the changes to the Constitution proposed by a PAP Government. Far from it. If constitutional amendments are in the interest of our people. we will support them. But if we assessed that the proposed changes to the Constitution are detrimental to Singapore and Singaporeans, we will speak against them and vote against them.\\nVoting against Constitutional amendments is not something that PAP MPs will be able to do if their party whip is not lifted. They can talk all they like in this House and go to the ends of the earth claiming to make a principled stand, but they cannot vote other than how the PAP leadership dictates.\\nSir, the WP seeks an evolution of Singapore\\'s politics towards a permanent presence of elected Opposition MPs so as to ensure sufficient balance in our political system against an extraordinarily dominant PAP. We do not seek a revolution that includes a change of government at this stage of Singapore\\'s political development. Based on my reading, this view is consistent with the general public\\'s sentiment.\\nBut the PAP should not rest on its laurels because this can change and it is because of that question that has been asked before â what if a rogue government sprang from the bosom of the PAP?\\nThe PAP knows that as long as the WP is not in government, it will never have the full breadth of considerations and access to detail the PAP is privy to â Cabinet briefings and papers, access to hundreds of classified public surveys and, of course, the intellectual and operational engine of the Civil Service. \\nSo, the Deputy Prime Minister demands that we come up with a serious alternative agenda and an alternative budget at this stage, knowing that there is a more than likely chance we will inevitably fall short on details, owing to obvious information asymmetries. And come election time, the PAP can tell the public that no serious alternatives have been presented. \\nBut where we have alternative ideas, we have advanced them. We will continue to do so, in spite of the political realities. We have been open with Singaporeans and nailed our flag to the mast in the course of campaigning for the people\\'s votes to put us in Parliament. Our manifestos have not been an amalgamation of broad statements of purpose and glossy pictures, but specific proposals with a view to better the lives of Singaporeans. \\nIf these proposals that I have highlighted earlier were not serious, why did the PAP take them on board and devote fiscal resources to fund them and policy resources to implement them?\\nAt its core, Mr Speaker, respectfully, what the Deputy Prime Minister has to appreciate is that the public expectations of the WP in Parliament as elected MPs differ from the PAP\\'s expectations from the WP â and rightly so. \\nFor many Singaporeans, the key operative consideration in making their vote count goes far beyond and transcends just a change of government. There are real political questions the voters have to consider, which they are acutely aware of.\\nFirstly, Singaporeans want an Opposition to check the PAP because in their heart of hearts, we all know that \"ownself check ownself\" is not realistic. The inherent nature of power makes this unrealistic. \\nSecondly, it is in our collective self-interest that no one party can amend the Constitution â the highest law of our land â at will. So, it is wise to have at least one third of this House in a party or parties other than the PAP.\\nThirdly, in the same vein as the Prime Minister alluded to in his speech in this debate, Singapore\\'s future is not a given. It follows that no one can ignore the possibility of a rogue government springing from the bosom of the PAP. Our people should have real political options if or when that happens.\\nThese are the reasons why there should be a strong Opposition presence in this House even before we talk of a change of government, alternative agendas and alternative budgets. \\nIn fact, PAP MP Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim said in the course of this debate, \"Iron sharpens iron. The rigours of debates and contestation of ideas on issues that are important to Singaporeans can help all of us formulate new ways forward for Singapore.\" He could not have put it better.\\nAt some point, in the name of inclusivity and a united Singapore in the face of grave external challenges, I hope the PAP can rise above political partisanship and acknowledge the political contribution of the WP towards the betterment of Singapore and Singaporeans.\\nIn conclusion, Mr Speaker, just as the President has set out the direction the Government is taking, let me set out the approach of the WP for this second session of Parliament of the Government\\'s term. \\nThe WP\\'s approach involves an acceptance that the political reality in Singapore is the overwhelming dominance of the PAP today. Part of that PAP\\'s supremacy comes from the performance of the PAP in delivering what citizens want, especially in the early decades of Singapore\\'s self rule, then Independence. \\nPart of that dominance has also come from hardball political tactics that also hosted policies with collateral purposes that suppressed the growth of an Opposition such as politicising ostensibly community-focused organisations such as the People\\'s Association, which does the bidding of even unelected advisors.\\nWhat is the appropriate response to such dominance? Some believe, perhaps naively, that it is best to work within the system, to change things from within the establishment.\\nIs that a realistic possibility? Perhaps it is. If you make it to one of a handful of top positions. \\nBut even the late President Ong Teng Cheong, who was very close to the top of PAP politics as deputy prime minister and seemingly right at the top of our political hierarchy as President, could not get the information he wanted. How much less realistic then for those lower down the establishment\\'s pecking order to achieve substantive goals for change?\\nThe alternative in responding to PAP\\'s dominance is to appeal directly to the people â by contesting in elections and leaving it to the voters and having faith in their judgement. This is the path the WP, its MPs, members and volunteers have chosen. \\nSo, the direction the WP must take while in Parliament is to worthy of the votes that have put us in Parliament. Just as the Government is essentially continuing its last term and also the previous session of Parliament, so are we. We will continue to raise alternative proposals within the limits of our resources and the information we have or is made available.\\nWe will be glad to see the PAP implement policies we have suggested, whether they say that those ideas were already in their pipeline or whether they merely adopt them without attribution. But most critically, no matter the challenge or obstacle, the Opposition must be focused and continue to endeavour, work for and defend the interests of Singaporeans and Singapore, as equal and fellow Singaporeans, together in the same boat, rowing in the same direction, be it in or out of this House. [Applause.]\\nMr Speaker: Minister Tan See Leng.\\n1.29 pm\\nThe Minister for Manpower and Second Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tan See Leng): Mr Speaker, thank you. I would like to seek a point of clarification to Mr Pritam Singh\\'s speech earlier on. In his speech, he said that asking the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) to release statistics is like drawing blood from a stone.\\nI want to highlight the point that on his question on the number of intra-corporate transferees, on 6 July 2021, in the Ministerial Statement, I had already provided the numbers. There were 4,200 intra-corporate transferees working in Singapore the year before â that is, 2020 â a number that has remained consistently small. And, of course, the rest of it is available in the Hansard. It is also published in The Straits Times as well. \\nI think the point to highlight to everyone, every Member of the House and particularly in response to your statement is that many of the questions that were asked â both by the WP as well as by the PSP â were not just on the numbers pertaining to intra- corporate transferees. But the Member has also put the questions together on the breakdown of whether the jobs went to Singapore Citizens who were born in Singapore or who were naturalised Singaporeans, amongst other types of confidential information that was not readily released.\\nNotwithstanding that, in the interest of addressing the issue in Parliament, to the best extent that is possible, our MOM officials came up to put the statistics up required by MPs. I hope that we can have this social compact â and let us make no mistakes about it that the vitriol and the raw emotions at that particular point in time, I hope was really something that we should all try to avoid. And I hope that they were not due to other factors outside of what the questions were intended to be. And I hope that they were not due to deliberate efforts to frustrate our social compact. \\nTo the Member\\'s point about the confidential information that could have been released earlier, I believe that it cannot be the reason for the ugly xenophobia, the racial undertones surrounding CECA. I think that is the point that I would like to clarify.\\nMr Speaker: Mr Singh. \\nMr Pritam Singh: Thank you, Mr Speaker. Before I go into the nub of the matter as raised by the hon Minister for Manpower, in terms of the xenophobic elements which the Minister raised, we are at ad idem. We do not want our compact to be disrupted and overturned because of these reasons. So, to that extent, we are on the same page. \\nBut let me just share with the Minister that when I referred to the intra-corporate transferees, Minister would recall in the debate that Minister refers to, that the Parliamentary Questions were asked well before the answers that he gave in Parliament in July. Mr Leon Perera had â if my memory serves me correctly and I stand corrected, Mr Speaker, I am going based on memory alone â asked the question on the number of intra-corporate transferees in 2016. And the answer in Parliament from the Minister for Manpower was, \"we don\\'t reveal these numbers.\" And the point we were making â and the point I made in my speech again today â was if those numbers were released, because the numbers were low â they could have punctured all that xenophobia quite early. And the point I am making was I could not understand why it was difficult to provide the information in 2016. But then when things are descending into an abyss, the numbers start coming out.\\nI made this point earlier. I made this point in the course of that debate and this was then Minister Ong Ye Kung\\'s reply. I made the same point and there is no real difference in the point that I am making now. And this is what he said in my response to releasing information earlier: \"I take to heart what the Leader of the Opposition has said that, with information, we can quell such falsehoods much earlier. We work in a bureaucracy. Some data is classified secret, confidential and so on. So, we are not at liberty to always disclose them. But what you say is true. Some information, it is better for it to come out early and then we can move on, especially as you said when it concerns issues like racism or xenophobia, it is much better to credit early.\"\\nSir, I hope that response addresses the point put to me by the Minister for Manpower. I am suggesting that in certain issues of great significance, the Government is better off providing more information rather than less. \\nMr Speaker: Minister Tan See Leng.\\nDr Tan See Leng: First and foremost, given the low number of intra-corporate transferees and, as the Leader of the Opposition has persistently said that these are matters of national interest, it appears that in every single debate that we have, every single issue has now been put up as national interest. I am glad he acknowledges and he shares my point about having this common social compact. But I hope that in terms of perhaps prioritising some of these questions and having a more precise and surgical differentiated way of asking these questions could be one way of making it a lot easier.\\nMr Speaker: Minister Ong Ye Kung.\\nThe Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung): I was not intending to speak but the Leader of the Opposition mentioned my name a few times. What the Leader of the Opposition said in his speech, I think it was a similar point that he made in the July 2021 debate, which was that if only MOM released the number early, you could have quelled all the xenophobia. I took that point. \\nAnd my answer in July 2021, I think it is the same answer today. We take to heart the feedback that the Member gave. If we have released, perhaps, it would have quelled all the xenophobia and all the raw emotions. But as Minister Tan See Leng said, that data was graded confidential or maybe even secret, I am not sure. But it was not ready for release, because when you release intra-corporate transferees of a particular country, others may compare, it can have other ramifications. So, it is not something that Ministry officials will readily say, \"Let us release it for Parliament\". But the situation became like that. CECA became a big issue with a lot of raw emotions, got debated here. In the end, these Ministers had a serious discussion and said \"Let us release it\". And so, we take your point but it is not that straightforward a matter but nevertheless.\\nI think what Minister Tan See Leng is also trying to say is that after all this, let us not blame this whole debate and raw emotions around CECA on MOM because they never released intra-corporate transferee data. It is not because of that. No. If we are honest with ourselves, it is not because of that. It could have quelled it. But I think many other factors took place resulting in those raw emotions, which is most unfortunate.\\nMr Speaker: Mr Pritam Singh.\\nMr Pritam Singh: Mr Speaker, I actually did not intend to bring up this point in the course of my speech today. But because Minister Ong mentioned yesterday in the context of presenting alternative budgets, alternative agendas, he said, \"just file a question, you\\'ll get a written answer\". I think that caused me to pause. Because the answer that was given in 2016 â and again, I stand corrected if my memory fails me â was not that the reason we are not releasing the ICT data was because there could be commercial sensitivities and so forth. In fact, there was no reason given at all, if I am not wrong. It was \"We don\\'t release this figure, period\".\\nSo, again, I think the question really comes back down to thinking carefully about whether that information truly is going to be problematic and what is in our interests, given Singapore\\'s situation, given how some of these agreements can be problematic. And I have to add, again, I am going back six years. So, I remember the question of CECA did not just drop from the sky in 2015, 2016, 2017, around that period. Factually, the Government website, also had to come out and clarify some of these issues. So, in that context, I am not blaming MOM or pointing the finger at MOM, but making a larger meta point about how important it can be for information to be released and to take a different attitude towards it.\\nMr Speaker: Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.\\nThe Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Lawrence Wong): Sir, on the larger point that the Leader of the Opposition Mr Singh had highlighted, I am glad that he agrees with me that we do need both serious Government and serious Opposition in our maturing democracy. I made the point in my speech. He has a different view on the way I have characterised some of the proposals made by the Opposition. That is his view and I accept that. I think there we may well have to agree to disagree.\\nBut I made this broader point about how our democracy will evolve because I do worry when I look at how democracies elsewhere have evolved. Look at the great democracies of the world. Democracies far bigger, far more developed than us and look at where they are now â how their societies have become divided and polarised, how their systems have become stuck in gridlock. It is not as though their people are unloyal to their countries â not at all.\\nBut how is it that these countries have become so dysfunctional where politics is concerned? And what makes us so sure that Singapore is immune and we somehow can avoid such a fate happening in Singapore down the road? So, I think there are lessons for us. And the lessons are, if you look at many of these countries, populism has taken root and populism has damaged greatly their societies; divided and polarised their people.\\nWhat is populism? Populism is politics that suppresses the truth, shades the truth, gets into post-truth, distorts the facts for political advantage. Populism is politics that pretends there are simple answers to complex issues, because there are not. And if such populism were ever to take root in Singapore, well, in the short term, parties that push out such populist policies may gain some advantage, but in the longer term it will cause great damage to Singapore and Singaporeans.\\nSo, from the Government\\'s point of view, our stand is very clear. We reject all forms of populism. We make sure and we uphold honesty and integrity in policymaking. If the Government were ever to fall short of these standards, we expect the Opposition to call us out and say so. Please do. You have to do it. We expect you to do it.\\nConversely, if the Opposition were to propose ideas and policies that we feel are populist, we, likewise, will highlight them and highlight our concerns. Rightfully so.\\n So, I hope that is our common understanding of how we can take Singapore\\'s politics and democracy forward. Mr Pritam Singh said that Singaporeans believe in the cause of the Opposition and does not want the cause of the Opposition to falter and fade away. \\nI believe there is a role for the Opposition to play in our politics, in our democracy and it is a very important role to campaign for your ideas and your proposals to hold the elected Government to account and to offer serious alternatives to the Government. \\nMr Singh says it takes time and you are not ready to form the next Government. You take one step at a time, one-third. But in politics, things can happen very quickly.\\nSo, I am glad Mr Singh is mindful that there is an important role for the Opposition to play and I think he should start thinking about how he and the WP can, indeed, perhaps, not sitting on that side of the aisle, but on this side of the aisle in future, down the road. What sort of agenda you would offer Singaporeans and what you would do if you were to form the Government?\\nIf there is one thing that I hope all of us can take away from this debate and, given that there is, in fact, I would say, some common understanding of this, from what I hear from Mr Singh\\'s speech, one outcome that we might be able to say to Singaporeans, it is this: that together in this House, both sides of the House, we stand for a democracy that is maturing, a serious Government and a serious Opposition. We say yes to all that, but we say no to populism and political opportunism ever taking root in this House and in Singapore. [Applause.]\\nMr Speaker: Mr Singh. \\nMr Pritam Singh: Thank you, Mr Speaker. Let me just deal with the last point made by the hon Deputy Prime Minister. I do not think there is any difficulty for me or my colleagues to agree to that.\\nAnd I think that coming back to the Prime Minister\\'s speech, which I think a lot more Singaporeans should listen to, we know the future is not exactly smooth. There are a lot of unpredictable factors that we have to contend with and, in the course of debate in this House, we will be going back and forth at each other\\'s proposals and ideas.\\nBut insofar as populism and opportunism are concerned, I am quite certain that the Deputy Prime Minister means that it ought to work both ways. It cannot be a case of pointing fingers at the Opposition and accusing them of that when certain actions of ruling party politicians on the ground are no better.\\nBut having said that, I accept the Deputy Prime Minister\\'s concerns of our democracy and, certainly, the WP, and I hope the Opposition in general, will be mindful going forward and work towards the betterment of Singapore and Singaporeans. \\nMr Speaker: Mr Leong Mun Wai.\\nMr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member): Speaker, I would like to thank, first of all, the 4G leaders led by the Deputy Prime Minister, to have initiated this very frank discussion as to how our democracy is maturing and also what should be the way, how should be the way we work in Parliament. Unfortunately, I had been observing the proceedings at home for the last few days because of my family\\'s medical problems; and I also thank Speaker for being so indulgent in allowing me to have my absence.\\n First of all, I would like to say that the PSP is also very in agreement and supportive that in a maturing democracy, we need both a responsive Government and also an Opposition that can put up alternative policies. \\nHowever, I think what we have discussed so far in the debate is that there are two areas that we hope the Government would realise. One is, from the point of view of the PSP in the course of all my debates with the Government, is, one, data is really not enough. Two, which is quite obvious over the last few years from my experience in this Parliament, is the attitude of the Government towards the Opposition. And that point stands out very strongly, especially recently when the Deputy Prime Minister made the point that Opposition parties have not put up serious alternative agenda or policies. \\nSo, I would like to â\\nMr Speaker: Mr Leong, just to clarify, you are asking some clarifications?\\nMr Leong Mun Wai: Yes, yes. So, on the issue of data, can I ask the Manpower Minister, Dr Tan See Leng, that I was the one who initiated the job debate in 2021, and the purpose of initiating that debate is to really determine whether Singaporeans overall have been affected by the foreign talent policy or not. But until today, would the Minister agree that we do not have enough data to conclude with certainty that Singaporeans have not been displaced from the job market?\\nIn 2021, we raised this point that the Minister has claimed â I raise this point again that the Minister had raised the data that in the 15 years from 2005 to 2020, 380,000 PME jobs had been created for locals, which also include the Permanent Residents (PRs). But then we took the data and we looked at it, and then we asked, but this includes all the PRs in the definition of locals, right? So, during the same 15-year period, we have 650,000 new â\\nMr Speaker: Mr Leong, if I may ask, what is the clarification you are specifically asking for?\\nMr Leong Mun Wai: Yes, so, the Minister he has not provided enough data to prove conclusively that Singaporeans have not been displaced from the market. Can I ask that first question first?\\nMr Speaker: Minister Tan See Leng.\\nDr Tan See Leng: Mr Speaker, and to all Members of this House, I have consistently been providing the data. Perhaps the Member may not understand my overarching English, maybe the proficiency of my English. \\nToday, in Singapore, we are at full employment. Our long-term unemployment rate is at 0.6% to 0.7%. In fact, in my reports, as I have shared, for the year ending 2022, the number of resident employment, that means, locals â Singapore Citizens, PRs â resident employment has gone to even before pre-COVID-19 days, before 2019.\\n In all of my interventions, in all of my speeches, I have consistently shared that for the foreign talent that have come in, it has resulted in an increase in the number of jobs created and employment opportunities for Singaporeans. \\nThis is precisely my point earlier on to Mr Pritam Singh. When you want to go and dive into the data between whether that Singapore Citizen is born here or born elsewhere and then become naturalised, or how many generations, I think those kinds â no, no, I am not conflating it, Leader of the Opposition. I am not conflating. I am just saying, using it as an example to say that this is the type of data we do not release. So, I hope you do not conflate the entire discussions together. I rest my case. \\nMr Speaker: Mr Singh.\\nMr Pritam Singh: Thank you, Mr Speaker. Just for the record, I need to state this for the record because the WP never made a request for information on people born in Singapore. \\nSo, I just want to be very careful about that, because that gets us into very dangerous territory. \\nDr Tan See Leng: Thank you, thank you.\\nMr Speaker: Mr Leong Mun Wai.\\nMr Leong Mun Wai: Speaker, however, PSP disagrees. PSP thinks that â\\nMr Speaker: Mr Leong, this is not meant to be a debate on that particular issue. Your clarifications, please. You have other clarifications?\\nMr Leong Mun Wai: In that case, can we sort of agree to disagree here, that the Minister thinks that it is because the data is so sensitive, we cannot get into the bottom â\\nDr Tan See Leng: Point of order, Speaker. \\nMr Speaker: Minister Tan.\\nDr Tan See Leng: I was providing a point of clarification to Mr Pritam Singh\\'s speech. So, I hope that we can keep it as that. \\nMr Speaker: Mr Leong Mun Wai.\\nMr Leong Mun Wai: Speaker, I do not understand what is the meaning of that.\\nMr Speaker: Minister Tan See Leng, Mr Leong does not understand you.\\nMr Leong Mun Wai: Meaning I cannot ask a question? \\nDr Tan See Leng: Perhaps if he would like a separate debate, he can file another Parliamentary Question on the issue of the jobs statistics.\\nMr Leong Mun Wai: But, Speaker, just now I raised a clarification, right? So, the Minister had answered me. So, now, I ask for another clarification, that is okay, right?\\nMr Speaker: Yes. Please do. \\nMr Leong Mun Wai: In that case, can I clarify that we agree to disagree? You said that we cannot get into the breakdown of those numbers because you do not want to differentiate Singaporeans, naturalised Singaporeans, locals, PRs, all that. And, as a result, we cannot get to the bottom of whether Singaporeans have been displaced or not. \\nMr Speaker: Mr Leong, if I may, I think Minister Tan responded by explaining as to the employment situation in Singapore, as to how employment is being created. So, I think that was his response to your query about the displacement and so on. So, if you have further clarifications, please proceed. \\nMr Leong Mun Wai: Yes, Speaker, but I would like to make the point also that the unemployment data and overall employment figures sometimes can hide some of the other relevant information about what are the changes in the job market. \\nMr Speaker: And your clarification would be?\\nMr Leong Mun Wai: So, never mind, I will rest the case. Thanks. \\nMr Speaker: Ms Mariam Jaafar. \\n1.56 pm\\nMs Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang): Mr Speaker, I stand in the support of the Motion. I declare that I am the Managing Director and Partner of a management consulting firm that does work in the areas of digital, artificial intelligence and skills development.\\nAt the start of this Parliament term, I delivered my maiden speech titled \"The Nation that Learns the Fastest\". I spoke then about what I felt was needed for Singapore to thrive in a rapidly changing world: the importance of lifelong learning, the need for companies to take responsibility for their employees\\' learning, the need for companies to give more Singaporeans a chance and to look beyond paper qualifications, the need for stronger anti-discrimination protection, the need for each of us as leaders to go beyond telling people to be better, faster, work harder to providing emotional support, networks and social capital, and the need for companies to be better corporate citizens and proactively address critical social issues in order to earn the social licence to operate.\\nSo, it is with the greatest humility that I express my appreciation to the Government for the significant moves that have been made in the past two and a half years on each of these and the significant moves that will be made in the next two and a half years, some of which have been announced in the past weeks and days, and some that are yet to come but foreshadowed in the Forward SG conversations. I do not claim to be the first to bring forth any of these ideas. There is no such thing as a monopoly of ideas, but if my analysis and the voices of my residents and other Singaporeans that I have surfaced have had even a small impact on their thinking, I think the past two and a half years would have been well spent.\\nOn the announcements, there are a few areas where I would offer a slightly more nuanced view. Take, for example, the idea of supporting workers to take time off to train. The reality is, many companies, especially SMEs, find it challenging to give \"time off\" to train, and this is exacerbated by the experience that some SME owners have shared with me â that their employees do not seem to bring something useful back to the business after going for training, so, it is almost like sending them on a holiday. This is not good for employees either â the forgetting curve I referred to in my maiden speech tells us that they will quickly forget what they have learnt.\\nSir, it is really as Minister Chan Chun Sing has said before â business transformation and workforce transformation must go hand in hand. Decoupling training time and working time is less optimal than designing training to be integrated with their jobs while those jobs and the companies they belong to are being transformed. We have to push both, not separately, but together. An even more joined-up approach among the economic, workforce development and skills development agencies, would be incredibly useful.\\nBut, generally, the policy questions being considered and positions being taken address a lot of the preoccupations on my mind two and a half years ago. So, this could be a rather short speech, if the environment around us had not changed. \\nBut in that same two and a half years, some things have changed, or accelerated, significantly and suddenly. Prime Minister Lee and other Members have talked about the different storms and opportunities that preoccupy us today. I wish to speak today on one of these things that has become a preoccupation on my mind and that of many business leaders, that is, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence or AI, precipitated by the explosion of interest in generative AI.\\nGenerative AI has been developing quietly for some time, gaining attention in recent years with the launch of technologies, like DALL.E, Image Generation, Mind Journey, Stable Diffusion. But it got a massive shot in the arm with the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, which became the fastest growing app in history, reaching 1.6 billion visits in March. Suddenly, in the words of Andrei Karpathy, one of the founders of OpenAi, \"English is the hottest new programming language\" and anyone could access ChatGPT to generate the most likely output to any query and take advantage of its key distinguishing feature â the ability to generate new realistic content â text, image or video.\\nIn effect, generative AI has democratised AI â and when democratisation happens, revolution is usually swift to follow. Much as the launch of the first Web Browser MOSAIC in 1993 democratised the Internet and triggered the Internet revolution, ChatGPT and other generative AI technologies are triggering the AI revolution and will transform all industries and societies.\\nThe possibilities opened up by generative AI are well documented. The hon Member Dr Tan Wu Meng, and others have referenced some of these in their speeches this week. Generative AI enables greater productivity and the turbocharging of innovation to solve unsolved problems â in business, but also in education, in healthcare and in other areas that are going to help a lot of people. Insilico Medicine uses Generative AI to identify a novel drug candidate for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in just 21 days, compared to years in traditional drug discovery.\\nBut there are also a lot of risks and worries about generative AI and rightly so. Anyone who has used Chat GPT will know that the model can generate nonsense output. There are also real issues of output that is not factual or bias, due to bias in real world data. Businesses engaging in AI are grappling with the risk of data leaks, copyright infringement and uncontrollable shadow AI in their organisations. \\nCompanies and societies worry about socioeconomic displacement, the potential of job losses at an unprecedented scale, including of \"knowledge workers\" â marketers, lawyers, accountants, architects, developers, engineers, analysts, and, yes, even management consultants.\\nNo less worrying is the risk of ever more sophisticated phishing, deepfakes and fraud at the hands of bad people â cybercrime has never been easier! â the potential impact on security and defense, and the very institution of democracy itself. Then, there is the fact that a few companies control a large share of the technology, tech that is now moving from open source to proprietary ownership by companies with a for profit motive, leading to an AI arms race among companies and countries, for bigger and better algorithms, data, computing power and talent.\\nAnd what about the environment? If you thought Bitcoin\\'s energy consumption was bad, well, an Open AI study showed that the energy cost of training an AI algorithm is increasing at an exponential rate, which if it is continues, by 2027, in just four years, the largest model\\'s cost will surpass the GDP of the US.\\n Then, we have the speculative doomsday scenarios, where machines attain human level intelligence or artificial general intelligence (AGI), and take over the world, destroying humanity in the process. \\nSpeculative or not, so great is the worry, that the Future Life Institute put out a call for a six-month pause, or moratorium, on training AI models more powerful than Open AI\\'s GPT-4 model, and some very smart people have signed this proposal. In reality, we are further away from AGI than the recent hype may suggest. As Yann Le Cun of META put it, we humans are very language oriented. \"We think when something is fluent, it\\'s also intelligent, but it\\'s not true\". And I think that resonates with many of us.  \\n I will not go into the merits of the moratorium proposal â others much deeper in this field than me have opined on this, but as a believer in progress through knowledge, the idea seems unfruitful and impractical.  \\n For me, the real question is not, whether machines can attain human intelligence, or even when that might happen, but rather: how do we, as a country, best prepare for the eventual future and have a voice in influencing how it all develops to protect and advance our interests.\\n The time has come for governments to recognise that we are at a precipice and that they must act to determine the position they want to hold with respect to AI, the impact on their people and the required adaptations and the policies they must make going forward to ensure the effective and ethical development and deployment of AI and Generative AI.  \\nSingapore launched our National AI Strategy in 2019, which reflects our commitment to being a leader in developing and deploying scalable, impactful AI solutions, in key sectors of high value and relevance to our citizens and businesses along with five National AI Projects and five ecosystem enablers.\\nAI Singapore has partnered with businesses to nurture the development and adoption of AI models in key sectors like healthcare, transportation and finance. It also runs the AI Apprenticeship programme. In this year\\'s Committee of Supply (COS), Minister Josephine Teo, shared that AI Singapore will double the number of AI Apprentices trained over the next five years from 200 to 400. \\nAll this is good progress. But if we are standing at the precipice of an AI revolution, do we need to revisit the ambition, scope and pace of our national AI strategy and our AI policies, to avoid being left behind in the arms race, and to create more value for the world and for ourselves?\\n Today, I want to focus on two potential areas to double down on: one, building an AI and generative AI-ready people; and two, leading the way in promoting better and safer AI and generative AI development and deployment. \\nFirst, building an AI and generative AI-ready people. This AI revolution will have a massive impact on people and jobs. Four things we need to do.\\nFirst, anticipate. Anticipate how jobs will change in a generative AI world. Instead of creating content or code or preparing or processing documents, people will be supervising first drafts by AI while focusing more on strategic thinking, building customer relationships and developing more complex campaigns using AI tools. Some jobs will be eliminated. This is not new â we are used by now to technology disruption. But what is going to be different is the scale and speed at which this will happen. So, reskilling and reemployment, at scale, at speed, alongside managing the impact on people\\'s professional identity and self-esteem, is going to be a serious challenge. And we will need to face up to the possibility, the probability that some will be left behind and this will require a new tilt towards redistribution.\\nDuring this year\\'s Budget debate, I raised that the time may have come to consider retrenchment support and Deputy Prime Minister Wong suggested in his speech that targeted re-employment support is being considered. It is timely today, but think about what might be needed 10 years from now. We need to anticipate this and time the shifts appropriately.  \\n In making these shifts, I hope we will remember that AI itself could be part of the solution, removing some traditional trade-offs. For example, AI can help in personalised reskilling at scale. We could also look at using AI in social services to provide tailored social and reemployment support at scale â rather than compromising someone that tolerated for the sake of ease of implementation. While all this will require public trust in AI and public officer\\'s proper adoption of AI.  \\nSecond, develop. Develop talent for the range of AI roles required â data scientists, but also designers, engineers, ethicists and so on. Remember it is possible that AI will create as many jobs as it displaces. AI talent will be needed in business, academia and public service. And sorry, but we are not talking 400 people here. So, we will need training programmes at scale, at speed, to build a workforce that will be AI competitive 10 years from now.\\nThird, attract. Attract the global talent with the new skillsets for the new jobs that AI will create. I think we do not have to explain that.\\n And finally, engage. Engage Singaporeans to not fear this AI revolution, but to embrace it and this is a massive change management effort. I once received an email from a resident. He observed the challenges and stress that people have adapting to technology, and asked, why does Singapore have to move so fast to adopt the latest technology? Why are we so obsessed with becoming a Smart Nation? Why can we not make the choice to stick to low technology or non technology approaches on some things to make life easier for our people?\\n We need to make people understand it is not a matter of choice. The AI revolution will not wait for us. But we need to assure people that humans are not going anywhere â humans are needed to deploy AI effectively and ethically. We need to inspire people â it is not all about avoiding displacement â there are all these very exciting opportunities that a general purpose technology like generative AI allows the young and not so young, to find application in all facets of the economy, of life, that can create value for a lot of people and help a lot of people and that should be empowering.  And we need to monitor the pulse of our people and make interventions along the way.  \\nSecond, leading the way in promoting better and safer AI development and deployment. As Minister Ong said, responsible stewardship is a hallmark of our policy-making. AI governance and ethics is already a key pillar of the National AI strategy. Earlier in the day, Senior Minister of State Janil had talked about AI Verify and some of the tools that we have already developed by Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC). \\n But the many ethical and legal concerns that people have about AI point to the fact that research in AI governance and ethics has lagged other aspects like compute power. There are big questions yet unsolved on issues like liability in the event of harm or bias, like data protection, privacy protection. How to prevent ChatGPT from becoming a tool for spreading misinformation and bias? As we move towards to AGI, how to ensure that AI systems behave in ways that are aligned to human values will be critical to advancing the progress of AI.\\n So, regulation of AI is gathering momentum globally. More than 60 plus countries and territories are considering some 800 measures. Prominent among these is the EU AI Act, the first broad regulatory framework on AI, unveiled in 2021. The Act sets out different rules and bans certain practices and imposes stiff penalties, up to 6% of a company\\'s global revenues, for those in breach and the scope is global. But the rapid advances in generative AI show how difficult it is for regulations to keep up, with EU lawmakers struggling to reach consensus as to how to deal with them in the Act.  \\n In Singapore, the Model Governance Framework lays out principles, but not penalties. It seeks to build public trust and understanding and to balance innovation and protection. There is no AI specific regulation, but deployment of AI requires consideration of other existing regulations.\\nI think this approach is pragmatic, but some have wondered if it is too top down and does not do enough to ensure that responsibility cascades down the organisation. And others have asked if more regulatory power is needed given our status as a global financial and technological hub.  \\nSo, how could Singapore be of value to the world in this regard? One, invest in AI governance and ethics research; two, ensure ethical guiderails and legal protections keep up with the rapid advancements in generative AI; three, support businesses in setting up responsible AI programmes; and four, serve as a global reference point to contribute to the development of global standards. \\nGlobal standards are needed but difficult in a world where the global governance order is collapsing and on an issue that is so ideologically charged. But therein lies the opportunity for Singapore.\\nAs a colleague commented: \"Singapore\\'s middle ground between the East and West is uniquely interesting. The US or Western logic of absolute freedom of expression is hitting the limit of fake news at scale with generative AI. The Chinese over control is hitting the limit of tech progress\". He continued \"I find policy making in Singapore much more nuanced when approaching those questions. Less dogmatic. So for me, it brings legitimacy.\"\\n His comments raise an interesting question as to the role Singapore could play in leading a global effort. Whether we strengthen ethical guidelines or put more teeth with regulations and legal protections is something to be evaluated against the trade-offs between innovation and protection.\\nBut there can be more regrets in increasing understanding. How can we increase understanding and align others to work together to manage our common concerns? Forums with technology providers, civil society and governments help. Could the approach taken in dealing with online falsehoods and Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Regulations (POFMA) be something to consider â rigorous public hearings and a national debate to study the risks and issues and recommend strategies to deal with them? And hopefully, this time, we can all agree that it is for the common good and avoid its politicisation.  \\n Mr Speaker, the progress in AI is exciting and worrying at the same time. I agree with Dr Tan Wu Meng, that in a world of AI disruption, togetherness and trust is more important than ever before. But that alone is not enough. We need our AI strategies, policies and people to keep pace with the breathless development; so let us buckle up! [Applause.]\\n Mr Speaker: Mr Sitoh Yih Pin.\\n2.13 pm\\nMr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Motion. At the address for the Opening of the second session of the 14th Parliament last week, Mdm President spoke on the geopolitical and economic challenges we face on the horizon and the need to refresh our social compact. She also set out the Government\\'s agenda for the next half term of the 14th Parliament. \\nIn doing so, she reaffirmed the core values of Singaporeans: fairness, inclusivity, mutual support, equality and a sense of belonging for all regardless of background so that every Singaporean is afforded the opportunity to achieve his or her full potential.  \\nThese core values may appear intuitive to most Singaporeans in the context of the present day. It is almost like an unwritten code that forms part of the psyche of being a Singaporean.\\nAnd yet, we sometimes forget that these core values underpinning our social compact is not an inherent trait nor did it happen by chance. It is the result of hard work, deliberate effort and, dare I say, a lot of gumption and guts by our founding leaders in their efforts to build and forge social cohesion and unity among a diverse group of disparate migrant communities who have come to Singapore in search of a better future.\\nSir, in preparing to speak today, I chanced upon a speech that then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew gave on 11 December 1965 at Serangoon Gardens Circus.\\nIt was just after Independence â four months, in fact. Then-Prime Minister Lee was brutally frank and honest about the immense challenges that Singapore was facing post-Independence, but he also made it crystal clear the direction and values upon which Singapore was to be built upon moving forward.  \\nA part of his speech I thought summarised our social compact very well. He said, \"Anyway, the end result was that we were kicked out of Malaysia after two years. And I say that we make it succeed â from here. First, this belongs to all Singaporeans, regardless of race, language, religion. Second, when there is progress, we ensure that the progress is spread equally, regardless of race, language or religion. There will be the same schools for all, the same hospitals for all, the same low-cost housing for all â regardless of whether you are brown, black, yellow, green or any other spectrum of the rainbow. Provided you are loyal, you belong, you intend to make this place tick. I say you are a partner with me in this enterprise. And slowly, over the years, something is going to happen.\"\\nSir, that something did happen.\\nIn 1976, I started studying at Serangoon Gardens Secondary School as a 13-year-old, a stone\\'s throw from the same Serangoon Gardens Circus the speech was made a mere 11 years earlier. I was the middle child of three boys to a pair of Chinese language teachers living in the promised low-cost housing, attending the same school with my Malay, Indian and other Chinese schoolmates from varying socioeconomic backgrounds. Looking back, Sir, it is an absolute privilege to have lived through the earlier years where we worked towards this social compact together as a nation.  \\nSir, to put things in perspective, embarking on this multiracial and multicultural path with an inclusive social compact was a unique one at the time. As Mr Lee Kuan Yew also shared in his speech, the other path, which was arguably an easier and more popular route by other countries of the time, was communalism, where one appeals to one\\'s race, one\\'s language, one\\'s religion, oftentimes that of the majority.\\nBut we were determined, together with our successive leaders, to hold on and continue to build upon the core values of a multiracial, multicultural society that leverages diversity as a strength towards creating a shared sense of belonging and identity. In so doing, we have also allowed different communities to be free to preserve and promote their cultural heritage and to practice customs and beliefs while always being mindful of the rights and sensibilities of others.  \\nSir, we were never a homogenous people speaking a common tongue or practicing a common religion and I believe we never had any aspirations to be one. We were diverse but united in our belief that we are here to build a nation that every single one of us, regardless of race, language or religion, had a stake in.  \\nBeing unique took many years of hard work and consistency in nation-building and I will be the first to say that while we have come a long way, we are far from the finished article. In fact, this is likely to be a continuing work in progress for as long as we believe that this is the social compact we want for Singapore.\\nThere are some who point to instances which suggest the polarisation of Singapore\\'s society along socioeconomic status, race and nationality. There have also been vocal discussions on many social issues involving these topics. These topics that relate closely to our social compact.  I had also raised these issues at the Committee of Supply Debates for MCCY in the last two years. \\nSir, I think, however, that such discourse can be useful if discussed in a constructive and respectful manner. It can also prompt a deeper reflection about our values and what it means to be Singaporean.  \\nFrom another perspective, if we were instead a nation of one race, one language and one religion, then such discussions would surely end in a tragic outcome, as shown elsewhere around the world.    \\nBeing able to constructively discuss such sensitive matters freely speaks volumes on how far we have come since Independence. We exhibit concern over these matters because they are vitally important to us. We take collective action because it goes to the very core values of the social compact that we have so painstakingly built over the years.  \\nIt is therefore with much anticipation that I look forward to our Government\\'s efforts and agenda in refreshing our social compact.\\nMr Speaker, Sir, I would like to add that I listened to the speeches by the hon Members of the WP, Mr Leon Perera and Mr Faisal Manap. They made some comments about the People\\'s Association (PA) that I disagree with completely. Mr Leon Perera and Mr Faisal Manap are quite wrong. \\nThe People\\'s Association (PA) and its members are here to serve fellow Singaporeans and not to advance the interest of any political party. In fact, there are very strict rules on PA\\'s activities, its roles and its objectives.\\nMr Leon Perera and Mr Faisal Manap\\'s statements do not do justice to the contributions of many thousands of grassroots leaders, staff and volunteers in our PA community. These people come forward to serve the community and fellow residents and build a better Singapore.\\nMr Faisal Manap had also made comments about wanting to have the resources of a PA network and to be able to do things like give out Edusave awards.\\nHe only asked to be involved in some small selected part of the work of the grassroots advisor. He is not going to do the equally important work of explaining difficult Government policies. He is not going to go out into the community and explain the need for GST to be increased or for public transport fares to be adjusted or for any number of popular but vital and important policies where as community leaders, we have to convince residents that the long-term interests of Singapore are best served by taking these steps.\\nHe has asked to only do the nice things â hand out awards, take photographs, congratulate families. \\nYes, these are nice things. Events to celebrate. As a grassroots advisor, I am glad to be able to be with the families and share their joy and pride. But these are the results of Government programmes and Government policies.\\nIf Mr Faisal Manap is going to be honest about this issue, he needs to admit that he cannot fulfil the role of grassroots advisor on behalf of the Government when he disagrees with so many of the Government\\'s policies and with how the Government raises money to fund its progress.\\nMr Speaker, Sir, PA does important work for the good of Singapore and Singaporeans. It also handles the difficult work of engaging the public on the hard truths involved in making our society harmonious, peaceful and sustainable. I thank the hardworking staff and volunteers for all that they do for all of us. [Applause.]\\nMr Speaker: Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat.\\n2.24 pm\\nThe Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Heng Swee Keat): Mr Speaker, Sir, over the past few days, we have heard diverse views on how we can take Singapore forward in a more uncertain and contested world.\\nThe Prime Minister spoke about the grave geopolitical and economic outlook and how we must stay united, be go-getting and uphold our good standing in the world. Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence laid out five key shifts to create a stronger social compact to take Singapore forward. Members have offered perspectives and suggestions across a range of issues and concerns.\\nI will not attempt to sum up, which will not do justice to the range and quality of ideas that have been raised in this House but allow me to commend Members on two counts â first, for identifying difficult issues early, putting forward ideas and solutions to address them and highlighting the trade-offs. Second, that even in proposing changes, many Members abide by certain fundamentals precious to Singapore, such as fairness, multiracialism and our approach of tripartism. \\nThis is what Forward Singapore is about â building on strong foundations and at the same time, having the courage to do things differently from before if needed. \\nIt is befitting that this Debate is taking place in the year that we commemorate the 100th birth anniversary of Mr Lee Kuan Yew. \\nSome thirty years ago, I was at a meeting where Mr Lee asked a successful American venture capitalist why he had asked Mr Lee to meet with him. \\nThe American replied that Mr Lee was the \"ultimate entrepreneur\". While he, the venture capitalist, helped build successful companies, Mr Lee built a new nation â two remarkable lifelong learners learning from each other.\\nIndeed, the newly independent Singapore was akin to a startup â figuring out our economic strategy, attracting companies to invest, building up our workers\\' capabilities while ensuring national cohesion and security. \\nMr Lee did not do it alone. He had a team of capable comrades like Dr Goh Keng Swee, Mr Rajaratnam, Encik Othman Wok and many more. Together, they laid a strong foundation for Singapore to take off. The best way for us to remember Mr Lee and our founding fathers is to learn from and build on this. \\nIndeed, this is what Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence and the 4G team are doing â to refresh our social compact and bring Singapore forward. \\nLike Mr Lee and the founding fathers, the 4G team must win the trust of Singaporeans by setting out a clear plan to secure a better future for all. Our plans must address Singaporeans\\' aspirations and concerns, given today\\'s context of an ageing population, greater economic disruption, a worrisome international environment and differences in starting points. \\nThis is why the Forward Singapore agenda sets out the shifts we need to make to refresh our social compact. \\nThis unity and clear sense of purpose is crucial if we are to continue to secure our place in the world. \\nAs President said in her address, we must \"take the world as it is, and not what we wish it to be\". \\nOver the years, our policies and hard work have earned Singapore and Singaporeans a good reputation. The next lap will see new challenges as geopolitics become more unsettling, technology and innovation disrupt jobs more rapidly and our constraints of land, labour and carbon become tighter, but I am optimistic that we can once again turn challenges into opportunities and secure a bright future for Singapore and Singaporeans. \\nWithin our short history, we have managed to survive and thrive through even more difficult circumstances. A key lesson is that to continue to succeed, we must stay relevant and useful to the world while deepening our social cohesion and national unity. \\nAs we look forward towards the future, allow me to touch on three things we need to get right, in addition to the many that many of you have suggested. \\nFirst, we must grow a vibrant and innovative economy. \\nSecond, we must develop every Singaporean to their fullest potential and empower each one to thrive and succeed.\\nThird, we must remain open as an economy, as a society and as a people. \\nLet me start with growing the economy.\\nSome may ask whether we should move beyond economic growth to focus on other pressing domestic issues such as caring for our seniors and uplifting those with disadvantages. After all, we are almost at full employment and the constant call to upgrade and reskill can be tiresome. \\nThis is a false choice.\\nThroughout our history, growth has never been for growth\\'s sake. Growth is critical for giving us the means to build a better Singapore and better lives for Singaporeans. Growth allows our people to access good jobs, fulfil their aspirations and raise their families. It generates the resources for our nation to fund needs and priorities, such as supporting families, caring for our seniors and uplifting those with disadvantages. Thinking longer term, growth coupled with prudence has enabled us to build a buffer to weather many storms.\\nOur national reserves were created through the surpluses generated by strong economic growth. Our founding fathers and successive governments were disciplined about saving for a rainy day.\\nWithin my career, I have experienced many of such rainy days â the Asian Financial Crisis, the dot.com bubble, the Global Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, which plunged us into one of the worst recessions. We supported our workers and companies through these crises and retained their capabilities. This enabled Singapore to bounce back quickly.  \\nDuring the COVID-19 crisis, we rolled out five Budgets in one year and eventually drew down around $40 billion from past reserves to save lives and livelihoods. Most remarkably, we did not borrow a single cent, which would have burdened future generations. I am grateful, as a citizen, that we could do this. Without strong growth and the discipline of setting aside resources to provide a buffer against the unexpected, Singapore and Singaporeans would have been worse off.\\nSo, let us resolve to not just think about the next election, but to think long-term, about the future of Singapore and Singaporeans. We must do our best to build up the capability and resources for future generations of Singaporeans, just as the previous generations had done for us.\\nThis is why we should think carefully when the WP says that they reject the GST hike because one alternative that they have been constantly offering is to increase the proportion used from returns on investments. This will slow down the rate of accumulating reserves, leaving future generations with less resources.\\nSustaining growth and creating good jobs for our people will become harder in the years ahead. Besides getting our fiscal and monetary policies right, we must address structural changes that are sweeping across the world. Let me mention just three. \\nFirst, scientific and technological innovation will reshape every sector of the economy even more rapidly than before. Industry 4.0 is reshaping jobs and skills. Today, robots can enable factories to operate round-the-clock. In fact, I myself have seen several dark factories, where it is not even lighted up, because the robots were all doing the job and they did not need lights. And an AI can spot disease on x-rays as accurately as a human radiologist. Ms Mariam Jaafar spoke about the impact of AI earlier.\\nNew sectors like the digital economy and renewables, biotech and a whole range of others are advancing rapidly. There is now a more dynamic corporate landscape of startups and smaller companies, pushing the frontiers with greater agility. Many traditional firms and workers will find this competition unsettling. Competition not just from other countries or from foreigners, but from greater automation and AI. Yet these advances also offer the best hope for addressing global challenges like climate change and ageing populations, from extending healthy longevity, to new low-carbon technology that can bring us closer towards a net-zero world. We must learn to harness the best of science, technology and innovation, while supporting our workers and companies to ride these advances and blunting the sharp edges that they bring. \\nSecond, as countries realise the critical importance of technology, technological supply chains will increasingly bifurcate and fragment into competing blocs. The shift towards national security considerations and industrial policy will reverse the past three decades of globalisation and free trade. These will reduce efficiency and innovation. \\nWhat does this mean for Singapore? Singapore\\'s small open economy, which has benefited from an open, multi-lateral framework, can be badly affected. We must stay nimble and adapt quickly. \\nThird, ageing populations, especially in the developed world, will be a challenge for many governments. Ageing can significantly affect personal consumption, retirement adequacy, healthcare consumption and economic dynamism. In many countries, the social compact is being strained as societies confront this crisis. \\nSingapore is facing similar challenges, and we will have to make difficult policy moves like raising taxes to support growing social needs. More fundamentally, we need to grapple with the difficult but critical issue of talent and immigration, which I will speak more about later. \\nThese three structural changes will transform the global economy. To succeed, we must press on with efforts to transform our economy, with the Government, businesses and workers working closely together. \\nWe had made a good start seven years ago. The Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) mobilise companies and workers in every sector to prepare for the future. We are now into our second iteration. ITM 2.0 includes two additional pillars â resilience and sustainability. Resilience to address shocks in the supply chains and sustainability to address carbon constraints.\\nThere is also a sharper focus on the future of jobs and skills, to better deploy technology, and prepare for an ageing workforce. I visited two companies which leveraged technology to redesign higher-value and better jobs for their older workers. One automated their entire processes. The founder explained to me that he trained a staff in his 60s to supervise the new automated system. I should tell Mr Leong Mun Wai that the founder was a foreigner who has been working here for many years and the older worker was a Singaporean whom he cared about and said, \"I\\'d better redesign the process\" to keep him employed. \\nThis staff was very qualified to do this because he had gone through the difficult manual work before and if there was any breakdown in the system, he would happen to be the best person to be able to do that. He was thoughtful enough and caring enough to redesign the whole job and train him to do it.\\nAnother company adopted the use of exoskeletons to enable their staff to lift objects safely. \\nThe broader point is that job redesign can be empowering and inclusive, a point that Miss Rachel Ong mentioned yesterday about helping persons with disabilities. Besides enabling older workers who wish to continue working to do so in a fulfilling and safe manner, it can enable differently-abled people to take on good jobs and fulfil their potential. \\nWith science and technology determining the next bound of growth and competitiveness, we must deepen Singapore\\'s investments in R&D, and tighten the linkage between our R&D and industry transformation efforts. In a more contested world, we should position Singapore as a Global Asia node of technology, innovation and enterprise. This way, we can attract, create and capture value in Singapore, which will benefit not just ourselves, but the region and the world. \\nOver the years, we have invested in and grown our research, innovation and enterprise (RIE) capabilities. We have strengthened our research capabilities in our universities. The National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) are now ranked among the best in the world. \\nBesides anchoring multi-national enterprises, we have also developed a lively startup ecosystem, connecting venture capital and private equity with innovative startups and companies. Our efforts have yielded good outcomes. Singapore is ranked among the top ten most innovative economies in the world.\\nIn an age of contestation, we must build bridges, not walls. Positioning Singapore as a Global Asia node is of strategic importance. We seek to be a trusted partner with strong regulatory frameworks and rules, and connected to different parts of the world. We can be the place that facilitates collaboration between like-minded partners and countries.\\nWe must continue to welcome the best researchers and scientists and entrepreneurs from around the world. As several Nobel laureates who were in Singapore for the Global Young Scientists Summit earlier this year told their audience, \"Science is Global. By building bridges, we can stay relevant and useful to the world\". So, I was glad to hear Mr Pritam Singh say earlier on that the WP is not xenophobic. \\nI have spoken about growing our economy. Let me now move on to the next point. \\nUltimately, economic growth is about creating tangible benefits for all. To do this, we must develop every Singaporean fully and enable each to maximise his or her potential and seize opportunities.\\nThe World Bank ranks Singapore as the best place in the world for a child to realise his or her potential. It reflects our investments and shifts particularly in education, to support different pathways, skills and inclinations. And we plan to further widen the notion of meritocracy, as Minister Chan Chun Sing said earlier.\\nThrough our education system, we prepare our young people to navigate shifts and seize opportunities with confidence. One aspect is nurturing \"Asia-capable\" students who can operate and build connections in the region, which is a vast and growing market. Bilingualism and the experience of growing up in a multiracial society bring advantages.\\nWe nurture competencies like global awareness, cross-cultural literacy, communication and collaboration skills. And we provide opportunities for overseas exposure throughout the schooling journey, from internships to immersion programmes. These enable us to shape an outward orientation and acceptance of diversity from young. \\nWe also prepare our young people to harness and complement technology, by building skills that machines and AI cannot yet deliver well. For example, creativity, empathy and building connections are areas where human endeavour remains superior, at least for now. This is why we focus on building socio-emotional competencies, and enable our students to put scientific principles into practice through the Applied Learning Programme. \\nCoupled with scholarships and study awards that span industries and sectors, our young people receive a continuum of support to build relevant competencies, pursue their passions and join the workforce with confidence. \\nBut developing our people must go beyond the schooling years. Success in a more disruptive world requires continuous reskilling throughout life. We must, as Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence said, strive to be a \"Learning Society â from cradle to grave\". \\nWe will strengthen our SkillsFuture movement to ensure Singaporeans are resilient and well-equipped to face the future. This goes hand-in-hand with jobs transformation and business transformations that we mentioned earlier. It also complements ongoing efforts at the industry level to develop Singaporeans, including ongoing efforts by the Singapore Business Federation. And there is scope to partner companies to develop Singaporeans for regional and global leadership roles.\\nWhat does success look like when we put the efforts to develop our economy and our people together? Let me cite two concrete examples.  \\nIn our universities and research institutes, we have top academics and scientists working alongside Singaporeans who studied in the best universities in the world. This builds a strong ecosystem that attracts collaboration with the best researchers and universities. Our students benefit because they get to learn from top professors, interact with peers from all over the world, and strengthen their cross-cultural skills. \\nOverseas, we are seeing enterprising Singaporeans and Singapore companies chasing opportunities and building new partnerships. When I visited Ho Chi Minh City last year, I met a startup formed by a young Singaporean and his Vietnamese friend. They had studied together in Singapore, and the both of them gamely ventured forth, the Singaporean staying in Singapore to run the business operations, and the Vietnamese in Vietnam, running the IT operations. \\nThese two examples illustrate the final point I would like to raise, that is, for Singapore to continue thriving, Government-led efforts to deepen collaboration, be it in free trade, investments, or research, is not enough. To reap the full benefit of these collaborations, Singapore and Singaporeans must remain not just open and connected, but relevant and useful. \\nRemaining open in this era of contestation enables Singapore to capture new value and flows, and strengthen our capabilities. An open mindset and eagerness to venture beyond our shores enables Singaporeans to capture opportunities in the region and beyond. We must continually think about how Singapore and Singaporeans can be relevant and useful, and what special role we can play. Our value proposition is building connections across cultures and economies, and we must strengthen this.\\nOpenness is not new to Singapore. It is, in fact, core to our identity and values. Our plural, multiracial society reflects this open-mindedness. We chose to organise ourselves to ensure opportunities for all, regardless of race, language or religion. Just a few minutes earlier, we heard from Mr Sitoh Yih Pin a very moving account of his personal experience as a young student. \\nIt is an extraordinary principle, as the eminent historian Prof Wang Gungwu pointed out. Singapore, Prof Wang said, is the only nation that he knows of where the majority accepted that they had to treat everyone as equal and that a plural society was the foundation of her nationhood. \\nThis open-mindedness, coupled with our stable environment and strong governance, no doubt has resonance in today\\'s more fractured and fractious world.\\nI am happy to see many of our people, especially our youths, venturing abroad. Our Global Innovation Alliance (GIA) â a network of 17 innovation hotspots around the world â has enabled our entrepreneurs to incubate their ideas and find partners overseas. Many local companies are also internationalising and finding success overseas. \\nOur companies tap on their diverse workforce to navigate foreign markets. This spirit of adventure and entrepreneurship in our people is commendable. The value of being a Singaporean will rise if we remain dynamic, outward-looking and effective in building connections with people around the world. We must continue to encourage Singaporeans to venture out and to integrate the foreigners who are studying and working here, so that we can draw energy and capabilities from diverse sources.\\nLet me repeat that. The value of being a Singaporean will rise, if we remain dynamic, outward-looking and effective in building connections with people around the world. We must continue to encourage Singaporeans to venture out and to integrate the foreigners who are studying and working here, so that we can draw energy and capabilities from diverse sources.\\nAt the same time, we must recognise that when the old encounters the new, this could spark off both opportunities and friction. While we pursue opportunities, we must also address frictions.\\nGrowing up in Singapore with fellow Singaporeans, we have developed a certain set of norms and behaviours. New citizens, Permanent Residents and work pass holders will likewise bring different sets of norms and behaviours. It may be uncomfortable experiencing these differences when we encounter newcomers. We may also be concerned about wealth inequality, more severe competition for jobs, or even unfair workplace practices. These are issues that the Government is addressing, by adjusting our policies, strengthening our frameworks and developing Singaporeans fully.\\nOur commitment to openness remains unchanged, but we, too, can refine our approach to openness to ensure that it is fit for the times. Mr S Rajaratnam, in the early days of nationhood, said that \"being a Singaporean is not a matter of ancestry, it is a conviction and choice\".\\nConviction and values remain fundamental when we consider newcomers who seek to be a part of Singapore. If there are those who share in our convictions and values, let us encourage them to contribute and invite them to grow Singapore together. Many already are, and we will further nurture the philanthropy ecosystem. At the same time, having developed a set of norms and behaviours that is precious to us, we should set out these expectations and exhort newcomers seeking to sink roots in Singapore to adapt to these norms and behaviours. \\nOn the part of Singaporeans born and raised here, we must have the patience and empathy to help newcomers settle in and integrate better. This is how we can remain open yet cohesive as a society; open-minded yet proud of our Singapore identity; and successful as a nation and a people. Mr Speaker, Sir, let me say a few words in Mandarin.  \\n(In Mandarin): [Please refer to Vernacular Speech.] Since our nation\\'s independence, openness and diversity have been critical to Singapore\\'s success. Today, Singapore\\'s ability to stand firm in a volatile world depends on how open-minded we are. \\nTo create a bigger stage for Singapore, first, we need to fully develop local talents. At the same time, we must continue to attract the best companies and the best talents.\\nForeign talents and the local labour workforce complement each other. When we attract high quality companies to set up shop here, we can create more jobs for Singaporeans. But foreigners could also compete with local workers. When local workers could not secure job offers or lose out on promotions, they might feel unfairly treated. On the other hand, when some foreign workers and their family members do not fully assimilate into our society, or do not adapt to our social norms, this could result in conflicts with Singaporeans.\\nI understand that Singaporeans are worried and concerned about these issues. The Government has fine-tuned its policies. We have stipulated specific requirements to address the quality of foreign talents and to prevent concentration in certain sectors. The Government is also doing more to develop and train Singaporeans to enhance their competitiveness.\\nAt the same time, I would like to encourage foreign talents and new immigrants. As long as you are determined to make Singapore your home, put in effort to assimilate and contribute to our Singapore society and build a sense of belonging, you will be one of us.\\nOnly then, can the Singapore society remain cohesive and our people united, with everyone working together for the prosperity and progress of our nation. An open and diverse Singapore society allows us to connect with the rest of the world. This is unique to Singapore. Only when our society remains open and diverse, can Singapore continue to embody our values and shine internationally.\\n(In English): Let me conclude in English. Mr Speaker, Sir, as we debated the Motion of thanks these past few days, I am struck by the President\\'s reminder to this House of our responsibility to steward Singapore for the next generations, just as previous generations have done for us. \\nI started this speech with a story of a venture capitalist calling Mr Lee Kuan Yew the \"ultimate entrepreneur\", for building a nation out of a colonial outpost. Since our Independence, we have navigated major changes well and innovated in many areas.\\nIn the coming years, securing our future will require us to continue transforming our economy and creating new opportunities for our people. We must continue to have this spirit of pushing our frontiers, to harness technology and innovation to improve the lives of Singaporeans. \\nWe must take care of the most vulnerable segments of our society, while ensuring that our broad middle continue to see improvements in their lives. \\nMost importantly, we must continue to build on the foundation of our national pledge â \"regardless of race, language or religion\" â to stay united in this contested world while deepening connections with people around the world. This way, Singapore and Singaporeans will stay relevant and useful to the world, and stay united and successful. Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion. [Applause.]\\nMr Speaker: Order. I propose to take a break now. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at 3.10 pm.\\n Sitting accordingly suspended\\n at 2.55 pm until 3.10 pm.\\nSitting resumed at 3.10 pm.\\n[Mr Speaker in the Chair]\\n DEBATE ON PRESIDENT\\'S ADDRESS\\nDebate resumed.\\nMr Speaker: Minister Edwin Tong.\\n3.10 pm\\nThe Minister for Culture, Community and Youth and Second Minister for Law (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have had several requests over the break to cut down on the speech. I am also mindful of colleagues who are celebrating Hari Raya and I want to wish them in advance Selamat Hari Raya. [Applause.]\\nSir, over the course of this week\\'s debate, we have talked about the many challenges that we see ahead of us, the shifts that we need to make in an increasingly difficult and changing environment â to face a harsher, more uncertain economic climate; to guard against growing inequality. \\nMembers have spoken about how we can strengthen our policies and our socio-economic infrastructure, in areas like education, employment and housing.  \\nSir, we have heard good many ideas and have had a lively, robust cut and thrust debate and I believe all these steps that we have heard in this House, they are all important, in and of themselves, as key success factors for Singapore. \\nBut equally critical and urgent is for us to be able to achieve all of this together, working in unity. All of us, a people of different backgrounds and persuasions, a diversity of cultures, faiths and languages coming together to build consensus, create space and forge a compact that can see us thrive and which can also help us withstand the growing external threats on the horizon. \\nOne shining example of how unity and cohesion has served us well was in how we tackled COVID-19 together, as a nation. \\nPrime Minister spoke about this, on Wednesday.  \\nOur nation\\'s collective sacrifices and efforts, with a high trust quotient for Government and institutions, saw us through COVID-19 and we came out stronger and more united after COVID than we were before. \\nIn a 2022 survey by the Pew Research Centre on how advanced economies were affected by COVID-19, Singapore was found to be less divided, and more united, after coming out of COVID-19. In fact, Singapore was ranked highest by quite a distance. \\nThis has in turn led to other positive outcomes, with our unity being a key driver behind the confidence we have in our healthcare system, as well as in our economic outlook and recovery.  \\nWorking together, caring for one another, having trust in our institutions â these qualities have seen us through the crisis of a generation. Compared to many other countries, some of which were deeply divided to begin with â they came out even more fractured after the experience. It is therefore vital for us that we continue to grow the reservoir of social capital that we have worked so hard on, over the years, to accumulate. \\n As various Members have noted in this House, we have long recognised the need for our country to be special, to forge a unique path as a multi-racial and multi-religious society, to be one that celebrates our ethnic diversity as strength, while having a shared sense of belonging and identity. Few societies around the world have succeeded in ensuring its citizens live harmoniously together, let alone one with as much diversity as Singapore. \\nI have no doubt that even as we have done well, and we have; our unity, our ability to stand together, will continuously be tested.\\nWe were an unlikely nation to begin with, and perhaps, we still are. We must never lose sight of our roots. In 1965, we were forced out on our own. At that time, we had a diverse population with a Chinese majority. We were surrounded by much larger Muslim majority countries around us. And as Mr Sitoh Yih Pin so emotionally and eloquently shared earlier, those were the founding circumstances of our country.\\nAnd almost counter intuitively, our founding leaders chose the path of most resistance. We chose to go against the grain and embraced multiculturalism and diverse ethnicities, to recognise and to uplift everyone to make our country a Singapore for all â not just for Chinese, Indians or Malays â and having a space for all religions. It was this bold step, born out of extremely difficult circumstances which became the original seed that has allowed our unique multicultural society to grow, to become more cohesive over the years and to flourish.\\nWe will continue to draw strength from that unity. It makes us stronger and it certainly gives us a basis to move forward, and we are stronger than the sum of our parts for that unity.\\nI would add that we did not just proclaim that we want to be a multicultural, multiracial society. We worked hard at it, we worked hard to make this happen, through our policies and through our institutions.\\nOur founding leaders, for instance, set out in our Constitution, the most basic document that we have in Singapore, for the government of the day to always have regard for the interests of our racial and religious minorities. We set up the Presidential Council on Minority Rights (PCMR). In almost no other place in the world is there an institution like the PCMR whose role is to scrutinise legislation after they are passed in this House to ensure that they are not disadvantageous to any particular racial or religious community.\\nWe have laws like the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act, which set out clear parameters to deter hate speech and other derogative comments on religious communities. And we do so because we want to ensure that every minority, whether in race or religion, will have the space and freedom to practise their religion and culture as much as possible.\\nOur electoral system guarantees minority representation in Parliament. And by doing so, no political party can prevail by narrowly appealing to only one racial or religious segment of society.\\nOur Ethnic Integration Policy allows us to have a balanced ethnic mix in our public housing so that we do not have racial enclaves like we see in many other countries. This is a policy that has ensured that for all of us, in our lived experience, day-to-day, where we go, where we live, where we do our super-marketing, we will come across a diverse range of different ethnicities at our doorstep in our daily lives. It helps us foster a strong relationship between our people and it shapes who we are and how we approach ethnicity, diversity in Singapore.\\nYet, even while we have made our diversity a pillar of strength, the uniqueness of Singapore, we must recognise that if we are not careful, it can very quickly become a point of vulnerability.  \\nWhen a society is as diverse as we are, harmony is not the natural order of things. And it is something that we must constantly work on, to jealously guard it and to be always fearful that it is taken away from us. \\nAround the world today, we see societies becoming more pluralistic; and as they do so, they also become more fractured. The most recent edition of the Edelman Trust Barometer shows that trust continues to decrease in many countries around the world. Not just trust in government, but in all institutions â businesses, the media and even in non-governmental organisations (NGOs). As various Members in this House have said, it is exceptional that Singapore has so far bucked that trend. This global trend of falling trust levels leads to deeper apprehension and suspicion. The shared common space is reduced and divisive ideologies take hold.  \\n These are not just foreign concepts or phenomena; these are developments that affect us in Singapore here as well. The increasing inter-connectedness of the virtual world means that many concerns that were once distant and foreign to us, now have the same immediacy and resonance as much as local ones. As Mr Seah Kian Peng has pointed out, it opens the door to foreign influences seeking to create divisions in our society, to target and to accentuate existing fault lines, or perhaps even create new ones by churning out increasing amounts of emotional, emotive, provocative media, with little or no basis in truth and we must assume that these foreign influences exist here, right here, on our shores.\\nSo, we cannot be complacent and take our cherished unity for granted and we cannot for a moment assume that we will be immune to this.\\nThis is why our Forward Singapore exercise is so important. One pillar of this exercise is the \"Unite\" pillar, where we bring Singaporeans together to explore what keeps us going as one people.\\nThis is, of course, not a new agenda â national unity has been one of our foremost priorities for many years. But aspirations change, challenges are different, they have shifted and the context in which we tackle these issues must also change. And so, we must be alive to all these changes, be cognisant of them and work out what would be the new approach in this new compact to tackle these issues. \\nFor instance, how do we create deeper personal, social bonds â particularly in a world that is so digitally connected? How do we nurture what is common between us, while at the same time celebrating our individual diversity? How do we stay united in the face of global headwinds? \\nI have attended several ForwardSG dialogues, met a range of people from different backgrounds, exchanged many views â some of which I will share here. And I must say that overall, I am very encouraged by what I have heard. I have come away with a significantly renewed sense of optimism, that Singaporeans care deeply about that unity, they appreciate how fragile it is and they want to come forward and proactively play a part to contribute to ensure that we do not lose that unity.  \\nOne key takeaway is that this unity is not an abstract concept â unity, cohesion, harmony â sometimes, if you do not pay attention, you might think it is just an abstract concept, but it is not. And we achieve it not by ideas alone, but more importantly by having it embedded in our daily lives: part and parcel of what we do, where we go, who we see and the people we socialise and work with.\\nIt is realised through these shared experiences, the various social and communal interactions that we may have and the spaces that we have to do so. \\n I have been Minister at the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) for almost three years now. I started almost three years ago when we were in the thick of COVID-19 â we could not come together, safe distancing measures meant that we had to keep people apart when our very mission was to bring people together. But over the last half a year to a year or so, I have been fortunate to be, in my capacity, at the intersection of so many different touch points of our community, where people from a broad cross section of society come together to pursue their passions. \\n Whether it is in sports or arts, heritage, culture, language, the youths, the grassroots network, or the various Chinese clans and associations that I meet on a regular basis. \\nAll of them come together at the different intersection points and all these sectors of our community represent tremendous opportunities for us to build our social capital and enhance our sense of cohesion and unity. These are the platforms on which people can engage with one another, day to day, and through such interactions, begin to foster deeper relations and build trust and rapport. We cannot force unity and cohesion. But we can institutionally create the environment for people to come together to inter-mix across different fault lines, across different segments of our society. \\nSo, let me share some thoughts on what MCCY has done and has in mind, to ensure that we continue to foster this deep sense of unity.\\nFirst, Mr Murali Pillai, when he spoke, talked about sports as a tremendous opportunity for us to level the playing field. Dr Tan Wu Meng spoke about togetherness and, indeed, all of these are different ways of expressing that we need to have avenues for us to have social mixing between different segments of our society.\\nKey to fostering stronger unity is to have both occasion and opportunity for people from different backgrounds to see and enjoy spending time with one another, through the passions that they pursue so that we are not stratified and constantly in our own social circles only and in our own echo chambers. Stratification is very unhealthy and it can lead to entrenched inter-generational stratification as well if we are not careful. So, we need to break down these barriers, not just along racial or religious lines but also between other fault lines in our society â like local and foreigner, the different income groups, between the young and old, as well as inter-generational conflict. \\nOn this note, I am very grateful for the good work that has been done by all many ground-up organisations. I have visited many of them, as I am sure many of my colleagues here have â whether it is the social service agencies or voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs), clan associations, self-help groups and so on. Through their own initiative and effort, people are brought together in a variety of ways. For example, within churches, mosques and temples, and other places of worship. These places of worship might serve a specific religious community, but they are completely agnostic when it comes to running programmes with a broader social reach and impact.\\nMany of our religious institutions work together, to benefit their neighbourhoods and in so doing, provide opportunities for their congregation to inter-mix and to get to know each other. For instance, the Al Mawaddah mosque, Sengkang Methodist Church and Arulmigu Velmurugan Gnanamuneeswarar â and I hope I got that right. \\nThe Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for Social Policies (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam): No. [Laughter.]\\nMr Edwin Tong Chun Fai: No. My apologies. And I will have to work on that on my pronunciation.\\nThey work together constantly â and while I may get the names wrong â they all come from different faiths, but they come together to serve underprivileged residents in the vicinity, the neighbourhood in which they operate. Different faiths bound by a common social purpose.\\nI was recently at the Masjid Kampung Siglap for buka puasa, again, as I am sure many of my colleagues here were. What was special about that occasion? The mosque had invited groups from the surrounding temples and churches, and lay people in the estate to come and join them. And when I chatted with them, I found out that many of them had never seen the inside of a mosque, let alone experience buka puasa. It was a special occasion to be able to share that experience together.\\nYoung children who were seeing this for the first time, I am sure, would have been left with a better understanding of the Muslim faith and of the meaning of Muslim practices. And so, the next time they step into a mosque or the next time they engage with a friend who is from the Muslim faith, who is fasting, it no longer feels strange or unknown to them.\\nThis how we foster understanding and build unity, bit by bit, at a very micro-level but coming together, stronger than the sum of our parts, as I said.\\nAnd we want to go beyond just religious tolerance, to a better understanding and appreciation; and grow as a country to embrace differences in our multicultural and multi-religious society. That is after all our aspiration.   \\nTo this end, MCCY has also recently refreshed our Racial and Religious Harmony Circles. At the local level, Harmony Circles provide the structures that foster friendships and build mutual respect in local networks. These circles have served us well over the years to bring different stakeholders in our neighbourhoods coming together. But to reach more and newer sections and, perhaps, younger segments of our community, MCCY will further support their efforts to digitise and expand their programme offerings so that we bring more people in to participate and get to know each other. \\nStarting from this year, we will also be dedicating July as our Racial and Religious Harmony Month â not just a day but a month, to highlight the efforts of our Harmony Circles and our community partners and organise more activities to celebrate and to promote racial and religious harmony, so that the significance of the day and of the occasion and the learning points go beyond just spending a day celebrating one another\\'s special occasions â coming in a different attire, perhaps, or costume, celebrating by exchanging goodies and gifts associated with festivities of other races. Going beyond that, to connect with one another through these traditions and share understanding of these traditions, to deepen an understanding and inculcate the value of openness and appreciation.\\nAnother step that we are exploring is a joint initiative we will have with the Ministry of Education (MOE). Students, as you know, are allocated to their schools based on their academic merit. But there is no reason why this same configuration should also hold for co-curricular activities (CCAs). So, the Strategic Partnership Co-Curricular Activity (SP-CCA) initiative allows secondary students to join in various CCAs outside of their own schools, increasing the variety of the CCAs that students will have access to.\\nBut this initiative has other social benefits. It allows students from different schools, different backgrounds to take part in their chosen CCAs, and helps them to come together outside of school to form friendships. Our students may attend different schools based on the academic curriculum offered, but these non-academic interactions need not be confined by the same terms. So, outside of the subjects they study, they are more enriched when they engage with the wider social network, mix with and form friendships across different schools.\\nSecond, as we build a better home for ourselves, staying united as a country also means being inclusive â having a space for all of us.\\nIn this debate, we have heard a lot about meritocracy and how we will uplift our workers, our families, our children to ensure equal opportunities for all and how, for certain groups, we will have to actively intervene and shape the environment so that there can be better opportunities for all.\\nAt MCCY, there are also several ideas we are pursuing. My colleague, Senior Parliamentary Secretary Eric Chua, spoke on Wednesday about enhancing the landscape for persons with disabilities to alleviate the impediments that they face so they can come along together with us. And beyond that, how we should open up opportunities for persons who are differently abled and differently-interested to fulfil their passions and their potential.\\nFor persons with disabilities, one area we would like to spend a bit more time on is in sport. To spur greater sport participation among persons with disabilities, we have updated the Disability Sport Master Plan (DSMP) for this reason. \\nIndeed, as I am sure many Members who have had experience in this sector will attest to, sport can be a transformative tool, especially for persons with disabilities. It allows them to acquire vital social and communication skills, develop confidence about themselves and feel no inferiority complex. \\nThrough sport, persons with disabilities are also able to reduce the social stigma associated with their disability and are empowered to realise their potential.\\nLaunched in 2016, the DSMP has contributed to increased sport participation rates among persons with disability, rising from 28% in 2015 to 50% in 2019. Our target is 70% by 2030.\\nWe will develop pathways for aspiring para-athletes so that there are equal opportunities for talented Singaporeans, with ability or disability, to compete at the highest levels. This includes growing the pool of coaches and better coaching individuals with disabilities by developing their own professional and technical expertise in disability sports.\\nWe have also introduced a range of programmes, including learn-to-play programmes and the annual Play Inclusive campaign.\\nThe Play Inclusive campaign is where students from both the Special Education and mainstream schools come together. They train together and they compete together in unified sport competitions, for example, in goalball. By playing together on the same team, they bond with each other because they understand each other far better.\\nOur students who participate in these programmes say that these programmes help to normalise what can otherwise be sometimes an awkward situation. It reduces the curious stares and the moments of being overly polite when someone does not quite appreciate the circumstances that they are in. It also allows them to interact in a positive context and challenge assumptions about what they can or cannot do.\\nAn inclusive society is also one where diverse skills and talents can be better appreciated and valued and those with these talents have opportunities to develop and to advance.\\nWe have done much to open pathways in the arts. The School of the Arts (SOTA), for example, has made it possible to have high quality specialised arts education from the age of 13 and the University of the Arts now allows us to culminate with a degree in the arts in Singapore.\\nWe have invested in this to provide a comprehensive arts education so that for those who see this as their strength and as their passion, there will be rich opportunities.\\nWe will continue to invest in building up our creative industry to grow a flourishing and globally connected creative economy for the arts through new business models, development pathways and internationalisation opportunities.\\nWe are unlocking these new opportunities with the next iteration of Our SG Arts Plan and Our SG Heritage Plan so that we do not just stop at providing added qualifications but also create an entire cultural ecosystem and value chain for those interested to embark on a career and fulfil their aspirations and their potential. I think this is central to our notion of unity.\\nWe have also stepped up our support for those who excel in sports by providing pathways through the High Performance Sports system and enabling our TeamSG athletes to perform at their very best.\\nA key part of this ecosystem and this plan is the Sport Excellence Scholarship (spexScholarship) which is offered to our athletes with the potential to excel at major games or world-level events.\\nTake Shanti Pereira, for instance, our national sprinter. Many of you, I am sure, would have been very proud to have seen her break her records, making great strides recently, quite literally.\\nShanti returned last November to the spexScholarship. She spent some time away from the spexScholarship, but after a while, having discussed with her coach and the National Sports Association (NSA), decided to come back full-time and was supported by the spexScholarship, which grants her an allowance and benefits, and allows her to access support to sport science and sport medicine. She now trains full-time and competes overseas, all supported by the spexScholarship. Her decision, as you know, has paid off well, with her recent performances.\\nWe expanded the support so that athletes with the potential can focus full-time on their sporting pursuits and do us proud in Singapore.\\nBeyond supporting our top athletes, we will also enhance the accessibility of our programmes and facilities so that even more can participate in sports, perhaps not just for fitness but also socially, as a platform for bonding and mixing, as Mr Murali Pillai has suggested.\\nRecently, at Budget 2023, I had announced that we will put in an additional $100 of credits in the ActiveSG accounts of children aged four to 12 so that they can start accessing these programmes, not just for fitness but from a social mixing perspective from an early age.\\nSir, in this House, over the last few days, various Members have highlighted that Singapore\\'s concept of meritocracy could be too narrow. It needs to be refreshed to look beyond academic domains of schools and grades, where diverse skills and talents in non-academic domains such as the sports and arts are also recognised and everyone is given an opportunity to pursue their passion, hone their talents and do their best in their chosen field.\\nWe agree with that. That is why at MCCY, our work is focused on opening these different pathways in arts and sports, for instance, for us to celebrate and include those of different merits.\\nSir, on inclusion, Mr Pritam Singh earlier spoke about the English proficiency test. Let me share my thoughts in this House on the test.\\nSir, I know many people have different views on this and I respect them. I think there is range for a variety of different views on what weight you might place on this. But my own view is that the knowledge of English at a working level, while helpful, should not be a defining or, indeed, a limiting factor, which might happen if you introduce it as a single-point test.\\nAfter all, a significant proportion of Singaporeans throughout our history has not been able to speak English well, many of our parents and grandparents amongst them.\\nMy own grandmother would not pass this test. She is 96 years old today. She probably still would not pass this test today. But she continues to be a source of joy and value to the family in different ways, many of them intangible. \\nIf we had years ago applied this test, then someone like her may not have made it into Singapore. So, we have to think about that as well, as a consideration. That is why I urge this House, as we talk about this and think about this issue, let us not close our hearts to this, but to be open.\\nMr Pritam Singh said the key is in integration. I think that is the point that I have been emphasising. How do we integrate them? Is a single-point English test the best way of doing this? Or perhaps we look more broadly at the process of integration, which I believe is a long-term process.\\nAfter all, our Constitution sets out the criteria. You have got to be in Singapore for a period of time as a resident. Integration requires sustained efforts from all parties. It is a holistic approach.\\nSir, our immigration framework was tightened significantly in 2009 so that a broader range of factors can be considered to assess not just the applicant\\'s ability to contribute but also his or her ability to integrate well into our society and, perhaps also importantly, their commitment to want to sink their roots here.\\nThis includes factors such as the length of stay, which I have mentioned, family ties to Singapore and whether the applicant has studied in a national school or done National Service, for example. I believe these are equally, if not perhaps, in some cases, more effective as a marker of integration.\\nWe currently do not have a single-point English test or proficiency requirement for naturalisation, unlike some other countries.\\nIf you look at Japan, South Korea or the UK, I think they have a language test requirement. It is likely to be because they have a single, more common, more unified operating language.\\nBut that is unlike Singapore, which has four different official languages. Indeed, as Mr Pritam Singh would appreciate, the Constitution itself currently provides that one of the markers for naturalisation is working knowledge of any of the four official languages.\\nSo, I would not say that English proficiency is not important â I think there is value in that â but let us not make it a single qualifying test or single-point assessment for citizenship.\\nSir, let me now turn to our youths. The Forward Singapore exercise is about charting our way forward. Youths are an important part of this journey. To forge a viable compact, we must understand as well as support their dreams and aspirations in a completely different paradigm from when we were growing up. We must also give them a stake in Singapore\\'s future and have a voice.\\nOur young people today must come to terms with a myriad of complex world issues â challenges and constraints such as climate change, economic uncertainty, slowing social mobility and they will be growing up in the context of the ageing population that Minister Ong has spoken about. For all of these, there are no easy or quick solutions.\\nYet, as my colleague Minister of State Alvin Tan and many other Members of this House have articulated, our youths are undaunted. They are not deterred. They have expressed a keen desire, on the contrary, to be a key part of the solution.\\nIn my own engagements with the youth, I have found them to be very much seized with the issues of today. They know that the solutions that they can contribute will make an impact on their lives tomorrow.\\nAfter the President\\'s Address last week, I came across an article in TODAY online. Several youths were interviewed on how they wanted to be involved in nation-building. Some of them made comments and there were reactions which piqued my interest. So, I arranged to meet with a few of them and several other youths to learn and hear for myself first-hand what they were most concerned about, how they saw their role as future leaders and what more we could do to partner with them, to engage them, so that they can be part of that solution.\\nOne point which came up was the desire for a more in-depth discourse. They hoped for more details as to how their feedback and suggestions on policies, which were being considered by the Government, might result in some trade-offs that perhaps they had not thought about.\\nWe agreed that instead of taking an adversarial approach to policy suggestions, we could perhaps engage on these trade-offs and share views on opportunity costs, develop a deeper understanding of these considerations that would be helpful to making policy suggestions.\\nThese were all very constructive suggestions. With this in mind, we will introduce youth panels later this year. Youth panels will be for youths to develop policy recommendations together with the Government, with some differences.\\nThey will be youth-led and will be resourced by agencies like the National Youth Council (NYC) and perhaps the appropriate agency, depending on the domain. They will work on a topic or a policy which resonates with the youths of today â something that is topical, that has traction, interest and a fair number of young people support a discussion on the topic. \\nWe will share our policy considerations and trade-offs, exchange data points and most importantly, think with them on these questions. Against this backdrop, we will create space for our young people to take the lead in the deliberations and formulate suggestions.\\nThrough these panels, we want to engage our youths in meaningful and constructive discourse where they can also listen not just to us in the Government or the agencies, but also to the experience of other people in their position, appreciating that opinions may differ from their own and weighing competing priorities, looking at both the short term as well as having a longer lens perspective of these trade-offs. Together, they will develop policy considerations and present them to the Government.\\nIn turn, these recommendations will be taken seriously. We will make a conscious effort to close the loop with them, whatever the outcomes might be. Those which merit further discussion, we will consider for them to be presented here, in Parliament.\\nMCCY can consider sponsoring a White or Green Paper on the proposal so that they can be considered in this House and we can then all have a robust debate on them. Those involved in giving views or preparing the recommendations can see the impact of the work that they do.\\nWe are formulating this carefully and more details on these youth panels will be provided when ready. Over the next few months, we will consult with youths on the panels and on the key policy issues that they wish to see under the youth panels. We look forward to the active participation of our youths to shape the future of our country.\\nSir, I am confident that our youths will welcome this opportunity. I have always been encouraged by the heart that they have in bringing Singapore forward through my interactions with them.\\nSir, let me now conclude. Earlier this month, President Halimah and I met our Youth Corps leaders at the commencement ceremony of the leaders\\' programme. One of them, Lim Jia Yi, led a project called We+65. Started in 2022, this project reaches out to the less mobile seniors in Sembawang, with activities that helped to improve their mobility as well as their cognitive functions. And it was borne of her realisation that perhaps the seniors were less connected and had less resources available to them.\\nThis was done as part of a volunteering programme with the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) and Blossom Seeds Limited, a charity operating in that area. If you speak to Jia Yi, her sense of responsibility of her commitment to community will shine through clearly. She is passionate about reaching out across generations to befriend seniors, even as she herself is currently a full-time medical student. Busy as she is, she volunteers her time in many other charitable projects and events as well. And while she is young, her leadership was apparent â to bring and convene her fellow youths together to rally them to support her cause.\\nSir, Jia Yi is remarkable, but she is also not an outlier. She is one of the many Singaporeans who continue to step forward, without being asked, to contribute their time and their treasure. And we will continue to work with people like Jia Yi, striving to be those granules of sand which connect us to the bigger blocks of our society, our institutions and collectively make us stronger across generations, racial and religious groups and across the diversity of our population. \\nWhen I meet people like Jia Yi, I am reminded that, in fact, we are already different from so many others in the world, with what we have â diversity and harmony that has resulted from a system that structurally fosters equality, social mixing and integration. This is what the wisdom of an earlier generation of leaders have given to us and has allowed us to build on a strong foundation to chase our dreams and fulfil our ambitions. \\nSo, let us not throw out what has worked well for us over the years. Sometimes, you must look back, to look forward. And these are the elements, the fundamental building blocks that has made it work for Singapore. To continually work at fostering harmony between diverse communities of different races and faiths, creating opportunities for people of all abilities, talents and interests to excel, powered by a culture of inclusion, care and volunteerism.\\nSir, the Semangat yang Baru: Forging a New Singapore Spirit exhibition opened yesterday and I went to visit it. I encourage Members here in this House to visit it. It is at the National Museum and it is free for Singaporeans and PRs. It was an evocative and inspiring exhibition; also, thought-provoking. I left it, feeling a deep sense of pride.\\nIf there is one lesson that I learnt from this exhibition, it is that as a nation, we do not have much. We never had. We do not have natural resources and we do not have the blessings of a natural hinterland that we can take advantage of or indeed, space â which comes at a significant premium for us.\\nBut what we have is our people. We have always had that. We have always done much better, punched above our weight, gone further with our people. And if can continue to stand as one united people, as we declare in our national pledge, then I have no doubt that we will overcome these challenges, with confidence. And we will see a vibrant, thriving Singapore for generations to come. Mr Speaker, I support the Motion. [Applause.]\\nMr Speaker: Mr Pritam Singh.\\n3.48 pm\\nMr Pritam Singh: Thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank you to the Minister for his speech and for referring to the point I made about an English requirement.\\nSir, I have two clarifications. The first is this. I did not say that an English requirement would be a single point of consideration for PRs and new citizenship applications. I think the Minister, in his characterisation, framed it as a sort of litmus test. In fact, I made it clear in my speech today that it was a nudge to align our immigration policy and our bilingual policy.\\nAnd for individuals like foreign spouses who would have some difficulty, especially if English is not a common language that they use; or with respect to Minister\\'s family member who is very old now, for which a test may have been problematic a long time ago â the test is not in that context a veto factor. The existing criteria would apply and it would be a consideration when an immigration decision is considered â that actually this person already has a common lingua franca that many Singaporeans actually share. So, I think the point was a little more nuanced than what the Minister enunciated.\\nI think the second point is international students who are today foreigners; if they want to enter our primary school system, they already have to take a Cambridge English qualification test. So, it is not as if this is really a left-field suggestion or something which is too off the mark.\\nAnd to that end, I refer to the survey in my speech. I think the Minister would have seen it. The Minister referred to various criteria that we broadly know with respect to immigration. But that survey found the ability to communicate in English ranks number one. In fact, the number one position was shared with economic contributions to Singapore.\\nAnd in that context, I think it is a good time to include what MP Murali Pillai spoke about the psyche of the nation and how people\\'s views change through generations and how important this is becoming as a consideration for some Singaporeans.\\nBut I do not want to lean too much into one survey alone. I am sure the Ministry may have a more global perspective of opinion. I am just suggesting that this is something which I felt was important for the Government to consider.\\nMr Edwin Tong Chun Fai: I thank Mr Singh for that clarification. And perhaps, with your clarification it now appears that we are not that far apart, because you did use the phrase \"English test\" when you first raised it. I think it was during COS. And so, when I heard your speech then and earlier today, a test is a test you either pass or you fail. And there must be consequences if you do not pass. So, it was in that context that I said let us not use it as a single point consideration. But I am glad we have clarified that, and you are now saying that is one of several factors that we look at.\\nOn the survey, I understand, and as I said, it is not an unimportant consideration and I accept that. I think we all want to ensure that we can communicate with the people we see in Singapore, at least to a basic degree. And I can see where that is coming from. I can accept the sentiments conveyed in that survey. It is one survey, yes, but it does reflect sentiments in our society and I think we must take heed of it.\\nBut the point about international students, I think, comes from a different perspective. They are taking a qualifying test for a different reason. Because there is an academic element to their entry into the schools in Singapore. So, I do not think one should conflate the two different tests. There are meant for different purposes.\\nMr Speaker: Mr Murali Pillai.\\n3.52 pm\\nMr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok): Mr Speaker, Sir, we have just reached the end of the five-day debate on the Motion of thanks to the President. From my rough count, we heard 67 speeches in this debate. I am happy to note that all hon Members of this House who spoke are united in their support for the Motion.\\nJust a short while ago, before the break, I left this Chamber to visit the loo. There, I bumped into an hon Member, who said to me, that he was really looking forward to seeing me deliver my wrap-up speech. Pleased with his exuberance, I asked whether he was interested to get a sneak preview of what I intended to cover later. He, however, demured. He clarified that what he meant was that once I stand up to speak, it will be a cue for his family who is seeing these proceedings \"live\", that the debate would shortly end. [Laughter.]\\nSo, just like the hon Minister Edwin Tong who spoke before me, I get the drift. Hon Members will be happy to note that I will only make three short points in my speech.\\nFirst, I wish to thank the hon Members who spoke for sharing their valuable insights about the Government\\'s plans outlined by the President. This debate is significant because of the sheer breadth and depth of topics highlighted by hon Members for the Government\\'s consideration. I am not able to exhaustively set out all the topics, but will mention a few of them. \\nThe topics covered included: ensuring that economic growth benefits Singaporeans from all backgrounds, strengthening the tripartite trust, developing our skilled tradesmen, the need to reskill middle-aged workers for them to remain employable and decisively tackle workplace discriminations. All these points persuasively put across by our hon Members from the Labour Movement, such as Minister of State Desmond Tan, Mr Desmond Choo, Ms Yeo Wan Ling, Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman and Mr Patrick Tay.  \\nConcerns about our social compact, the need to strengthen help for have nots in our society â a point that several hon Members, including Mr Seah Kian Peng, Assoc Prof Jamus Lim, Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim and Mr Leong Mun Wai, made. \\n Ensuring better educational outcomes and prospects for children and youths from less privileged backgrounds â this was raised by, amongst others, hon Members Mr Vikram Nair, Dr Wan Rizal, Dr Shahira Abdullah and Mr Henry Kwek.\\n Keeping a keen eye on and addressing the impact of cost of living and inflation on our people â a topic that, again, a number of hon Members spoke on, including Mr Ang Wei Neng and Mr Louis Chua. \\nHighlighting the potenfial threat of Artificial Intelligence on our social trust and togetherness, and at the same time, the need to capture opportunities from this technological advancement â points that were eloquently put across by hon Members Dr Tan Wu Meng and Ms Mariam Jafaar.  \\n Ensuring that trust is a two-way relationship between our people and our Government, the need to promote active citizenry and retention of our core values as a society â points raised by hon Members Ms Tin Pei Ling, Ms He Ting Ru, Mr Leon Perera and Mr Shawn Huang. \\nMoving away from credentialism and valuing skills and competencies instead â something that several hon Members spoke on, including Ms Janet Ang.\\nLooking out for the needs of the differently abled â a topic that hon Members Mr Don Wee and Miss Rachel Ong touched on.  \\nEnsuring that our families remain the building blocks of our society, promoting marriages and parenthood, and at the same time, supporting these families as they become smaller and caregiving responsibilities increase â something that hon Members including Ms Jessica Tan and Mr Gan Thiam Poh spoke on.\\n Providing our rapidly ageing society with a befter support structure, tackling ageism and at the same time, empowering them to contribute to our community â points raised by hon Members Ms Sylvia Lim, Mr Yip Hon Weng, Mr Sakfiandi Supaat, Ms Hany Soh and Mr Edward Chia.  \\nProtecting our aged and vulnerable citizens from scams as we continue to digitalise our economy â a topic raised by amongst others, hon Members Mr Christopher de Souza and Mr Melvin Yong.\\nProviding more support to people with mental health issues â an important topic that was covered by hon Members Ms Ng Ling Ling and Ms Nadia Samdin.\\nOpening up a whole range of pathways to ensure that our meritocratic society is more inclusive â a good number of hon MPs spoke about this, including Mr Xie Yao Quan. \\nConcerns about the environmental issues that our country faces were expressed by several Members including Mr Sharael Taha and Mr Dennis Tan.\\nConcerns about the impact of unbridled asset acquisition in Singapore by increasing numbers of wealthy individuals from overseas who set up family offices â a point made by the hon Leader of Opposition.\\nAnd finally, upholding public confidence in this House and ensuring good politics, strong leadership and good governance at all levels â areas that hon Members Mr Derek Goh, Ms Joan Pereira and Mr Faisal Manap touched on.\\nNotwithstanding the diversity of the topics covered in this debate, I noted unanimity amongst hon Members on the importance of retaining our core values that have been ingrained in our nation by our founding generation of leaders and stood us in good stead for several generations. This is the point that Mr Sitoh Yih Pin emphatically made. He said that our values are and must continue to be hard-coded in our psyche as a people.\\nI agree. This is our secret sauce. This is what will allow us as a nation and society to continue to forge forward to secure a fair share of opportunities for our people to lead fulfilling and dignified lives.\\nMoving on to my second point, I wish to highlight that hon Members had provided a surfeit of suggestions in this debate. These suggestions deserve examination with a view to see if the future plans of this Government that have already been laid out, can be further strengthened by their incorporafion. They include: \\nLinking unemployment support for citizens with their agreement to undertake skills upgrading and active job searching â a suggestion raised jointly by hon Member Mr Desmond Choo. \\nAttaintment of transformative competencies by our children in school â a suggestion of hon Member Mr Darryl David.  \\nFinancial literacy programmes for our children â a suggestion raised by hon Member Mr Gerald Giam.  \\nProtection of whistle-blowers who report on discrimination and unfair employment practices â a suggestion by hon Member Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim.\\nEquipping community volunteers with mental health first aid skills â a suggestion by hon Member Ms Ng Ling Ling. \\nRedesigning of the Progressive Wage Models to provide for more wage rungs to enable workers to climb up more easily up â a suggestion by Mr Raj Joshua Thomas.\\nTo evolve our charity policies so as to support emerging forms of giving by potential grant-makers â a suggestion by Ms Foo Mee Har.\\nTapping on our seniors to get them to volunteer and share their skills and experience with others â an idea raised by hon Member Mr Yip Hon Weng.  \\nLegislating the right to work from home â an idea of hon Member Mr Louis Ng. \\nProviding for caregiving leave to take care of elderly parents â an idea of hon Member Ms Poh Li San; and  \\nEncouraging our non-SMEs to embracing inclusive hiring and employ more persons with disabilities â an idea floated and passionately argued by the hon Member Miss Rachel Ong \\nSeveral hon Members from across the aisle lamented that their suggestions have not been taken up by the Government. I appreciate that they feel strongly about their ideas and are convinced it is for the larger good of our country. I wish to point out that there are also numerous cases of suggestions made passionately by PAP backbenchers which also have not been taken up by the Government. So, they are in good company!\\nI think we can all appreciate that, in assessing the viability of implementing ideas from hon Members, the Executive arm of our Government bears the heavy responsibility of governing. They have to strike a balance between a wide range of factors including policy intent, competing viewpoints and resourcing priorities.\\nIn addition, for some of the ideas to be implemented, there is a need for progress to be made over time â a point that was eloquently put across by hon Member Ms Denise Phua who advocated the integrated 10-year education programme from Primary 1 to Secondary 4, almost 10 years ago.\\nHence, I would not read too much into the Government\\'s decision not to adopt all the suggestions made by hon Members. In fact, if anything, it would be surprising if all the ideas have been accepted without exception.\\nThe Government has unequivocally stated on many occasions that it is agnostic as to who and where good ideas come from. As the hon Leader of the Opposition stated in his speech just now, over the years, the Government did implement several policies that have been brought up by the WP. But of course, the Government, being accountable to this House, has a duty to set its position clearly on suggestions made in this House and articulate its reasons should it not take up the suggestions.\\nThis is Parliamentary democracy at work. This is what our people expect.\\nIn the same vein, for the purposes of establishing common ground which the President has identified in her address to be an important aspect of our work in this House, it would be good for hon Members from Opposition parties to also entrench the policy of acknowledging, where appropriate, where they feel to be good ideas emanating from the Government. This approach entrenches the shared goal of advancing the larger public interest even as we acknowledge that the political process naturally involves a level of contestation.\\nA great example of this happened just a few hours ago, when hon Member Mr Dennis Tan congratulated MOT and MPA for launching an electronic harbour launch recently, thereby reducing carbon dioxide emissions.\\nSir, I now turn my third and final point. From the debate, it is noteworthy that there is broad agreement to the Government\\'s plans as articulated by the President to secure our nation\\'s future. In my opening speech, I drew attention to the ambitious nature of these plans. They involve high levels of creativity. I spent some time highlighting the broad spectrum of plans affecting everything, from defence to the economy to the environment, as well as the fact that a long-term view has to be taken to implement these plans. \\nI therefore congratulate the Government for presenting these plans that have secured this broad agreement in this House.\\nThis, however, is merely the start. To an extent, this may be the easier part of the process. Collectively, we need to secure the all-important buy-in of fellow Singaporeans to make the plans work for the benefit of Singapore and Singaporeans. Whilst this is not an easy task, there is every reason to be confident, in my personal view.\\nThis is where what the President stated in her address about moving forward with confidence becomes relevant. She said: \"We are now in a much stronger position â better poised to overcome our vulnerabilities and armed with crucial resources to push forward with confidence, however stormy the weather. Our collective experiences have strengthened the mutual trust between Singaporeans and their confidence in our system of Government. This virtuous circle relies on us partnering one another and working together to make the impossible, possible.\"\\nI therefore call on all Members of this House, on both sides of the aisle, backbenchers and frontbenchers, to double down and work together to build happiness, prosperity and progress for our people. [Applause.]\\nResolved,\\n\"That the following Address in reply to the Speech of the President be agreed to:\\n\\'We, the Parliament of the Republic of Singapore, express our thanks to the President for the Speech which she delivered on behalf of the Government at the Opening of the Second Session of this Parliament.\\'.\"']"

      "The President (Mdm Halimah Yacob)\n",
      "Hon Members, please be seated. Parliament is reopening at an important milestone in our history.We have spent the last three years fighting the crisis of our generation. Together, we found our way through the uncertainties and fears of the pandemic.Because everyone played their part, we emerged stronger and more united than before. Social capital amongst Singaporeans has deepened, trust in Government has strengthened and our global reputation has been enhanced. These strengths will prove crucial on the road ahead.The worst of COVID-19 is now hopefully behind us. But there are new challenges ahead, as we enter an increasingly dangerous and troubled world.The war in Ukraine rages on and is unlikely to end soon. How the crisis unfolds will have major implications for the security of countries everywhere. The rivalry between US and China continues to intensify, and has recently taken a turn for the worse. Near-miss encounters are happening more frequently around the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea. Neither side wants to go to war, but events have their own momentum and accidents can easily spiral out of control in ways no one can predict. The global order is also being reshaped by strategic geopolitical rivalry. The major powers are focused more on unilaterally securing their own advantage, than on promoting mutual interdependence or strengthening the multilateral system. The international norms that underpin peace and prosperity in the world are under severe strain. These are realities we have to adapt to. As a small nation, we must take the world as it is, not as we wish it to be. But we are far from powerless on the international stage by acting together with like-minded partners, both big and small. We remain vigilant and proactive in defending ourselves against external threats. We will continue to build a network of friends to advance our shared interests. We will strive to preserve our sovereignty and the right to determine our own future, as we have done since Independence. Against the backdrop of great power rivalry, smaller countries like Singapore are experiencing growing pressures to take sides. We will be subject to foreign influences and disinformation campaigns, aimed at shaping our domestic public opinion and pressing the Government to adopt certain positions.  We must do our utmost to resist such pressures. We have to close ranks and stay united, regardless of race, religion, or political affiliation, especially when it comes to core national interests. We must never allow external parties to divide us and should always stand together as one people to uphold Singaporeâs vital interests. Unity will also be important as we push forward against the economic headwinds. Global trade and investment flows are facing growing obstacles. Governments in the major economies are providing substantial fiscal support to develop strategic industries and strengthen their own industrial bases. This creates a more unlevel playing field and tougher competition for us. We will adapt to these new circumstances and find opportunities amidst the challenges. We cannot compete headto-head with big powers seeking to control key technologies and industries in the global economy. But we can be more agile and nimble than others, and respond more quickly and effectively to new challenges and opportunities.  We will run up against more binding constraints in land, labour and carbon over the coming years, and will have to do our best to manage them. But even as we adjust and adapt, a few fundamental imperatives will not change.  We must stay connected to the world, strengthen our connectivity infrastructure and entrench our position as a trusted and reliable business hub.  We must develop talents and skills of our people throughout their careers and continue to attract foreigners with entrepreneurial networks and expertise to help grow opportunities for Singaporeans.  We must invest in innovation to unlock new areas of growth, including in digitalisation and sustainability.  Importantly, we must nurture the strong tripartite partnership between Government, businesses and workers.If we are adaptable and resourceful, we can strengthen our competitive advantage, and position ourselves best to prosper and thrive in this new environment.To do well in this troubled world and remain one united people, we will need to strengthen our social fabric. Every Singaporean must feel that they have a stake in our country. The fruits of our progress must be shared fairly and no one should feel left behind. This is the main purpose of the Forward Singapore exercise: to renew and update our social compact even as we refresh our goals and strategies. Collectively, the 4G team have engaged more than 14,000 Singaporeans over the past six months and are continuing to deepen these engagements.  This exercise reaffirms the core values that we hold dear as Singaporeans: fairness, inclusivity, mutual support and the desire to give back to society. We want every person to be treated equally with dignity and respect. We want a Singapore where everyone belongs, and every citizen has the chance to achieve his or her fullest potential. We want a society that values and supports families; where we care for and help one another and pitch in to make a difference to our community. These values will shape the Governmentâs agenda. We will expand opportunities throughout life for every citizen, regardless of their starting points. We will strengthen social safety nets so that in every stage of life, Singaporeans can better cope with uncertainties and look forward with confidence. We will build a smart and liveable city â a green, connected and thriving metropolis that we are all proud to call home. We will deepen Singaporeansâ sense of shared identity and mutual responsibility towards one another.  These will be the key priorities for the remainder of this term of Government.   First, we will expand opportunities throughout life for all, regardless of individual backgrounds and circumstances.   Meritocracy has long been the organising principle of our society. It has provided opportunities to countless Singaporeans with the drive and ability to excel. But as we prosper as a society, those who have already done well will naturally seek to pass on their advantages to their children. This is why absent major upheavals, all societies tend to become more stratified and less socially mobile over time.  We will do our utmost to combat this tendency. We must not allow advantages and privileges to become entrenched and persist over generations. This would weaken and fracture our society. We must ensure a broader and more open meritocracy that works well for all Singaporeans. This means rethinking our approach to education and work.  We will continue to prepare our children for the future, starting from their early years. We will provide more resources to support those who start out with less. At the same time, we recognise the competitive stresses that have built up in our education system, especially amongst certain segments of society. We will provide everyone with access to a good education, and many chances in life to learn and improve. But let us not be unwittingly drawn into an educational arms race and end up worse off as a society.   We must also re-examine how society rewards different skills and talents and recognises the full range of pathways to success. We should accord greater value to those who are skilled with their hands and contribute through their technical and practical abilities, as well as those with the social and empathetic traits to excel in jobs, such as caregiving or community service. Every Singaporean must have the opportunity to take on work they find fulfilling and meaningful, build on their talents, give of their best and be rewarded fairly for it.  At the same time, we will step up support for the disadvantaged and vulnerable segments in our society. We will uplift lower-income workers and families, and empower them to take the initiative to improve their own lives. We will enhance support for persons with disabilities, so they can pursue their aspirations and participate fully as contributing members of society. We will ensure that Singapore remains an open and inclusive society, where we uplift everyone with opportunities throughout their lives and where we interact with one another as equals, regardless of our backgrounds.Second, in a world of rapid change, the Government will improve social safety nets to help Singaporeans better cope with disruptions and setbacks in life.With more uncertainty in the world economy and faster technological change, workers, especially those in their 40s and 50s, are at higher risk of skills obsolescence and unemployment. During the pandemic, we implemented the COVID-19 Recovery Grant and the SGUnited Jobs and Skills programme to support those who had lost their jobs. We will study how we should extend similar support beyond the pandemic.Beyond helping displaced workers, we will further strengthen our SkillsFuture ecosystem to bring everyone along on our digitalisation and industry transformation journey. We will enable every citizen to do a significant skills reboot in the course of their working lives. This will help to keep them employable, whether they progress further in their respective fields, or transit across to jobs in new areas of growth.We will also strengthen the sense of assurance in other ways.We will take better care of our growing number of seniors. Through HealthierSG, we are stepping up preventive care and empowering citizens to manage their own health, and go for regular screenings and check-ups.    We will help Singaporeans enjoy their golden years with greater peace of mind, by enhancing retirement adequacy, and expanding care and living options. We will enable more seniors to age in place, in the comfort of their own homes, with their families and friends close by.We will also keep public housing affordable and accessible for Singaporeans. Close to 100,000 private and public homes are expected to be completed between now and 2025. We are giving priority to young married couples and families with children to purchase their first homes.Third, we will press on with longer-term efforts to build a city that is green, connected and highly liveable.We will continue to renew and transform our urban landscape. New centres and districts will be developed outside of the Central Business District (CBD), to pilot creative urban solutions that transform the way our people live, work and play. Technology will be a key enabler; our urban plans will be integrated with our Smart Nation vision.  Our built environment is not just about better hardware and infrastructure. The city should also become more people-friendly. We will strengthen the distinctive cultures and heritages of different neighbourhoods. We will have better-connected streets and green spaces that are conducive for walking and cycling, where people can meet, interact and connect with one another. We will make our housing estates more vibrant spaces where children grow up together, where shared memories are formed and where we nurture our unique identity as a multi-racial and multi-religious nation.  Fourth, we will strengthen our collective responsibility to shape our new compact. More government action should not result in a greater sense of dependency and entitlement. Instead, the Government will, through its actions, reinforce individual and family efforts, and bring forth contributions from other stakeholders.For instance, employers must do their part to invest in their workers. Community partners must complement government efforts to support vulnerable families, just as we rallied to support one another through the pandemic. Those who have done well must pay it forward and give others a hand, so that we help one another stand tall with dignity and pride.  To tackle the complex challenges ahead, Singapore will need a stronger network of stakeholders to participate in nation building. Committed businesses that champion socially responsible and sustainable practices. A passionate civil society that advocates for their visions of a better society. An active citizenry that takes ownership of issues. The Government will do more to mobilise and involve all stakeholders. In particular, our youths show strong interest to take action and initiate change on issues they care about, like mental well-being and sustainability. We will engage the ideas, dynamism and energy of our young Singaporeans. Ultimately, our refreshed social compact is about a shared understanding of how we relate to and support one another in our next phase of nationhood. By pooling our individual expertise, experiences and resources, we can achieve better outcomes for ourselves, our fellow citizens and our nation, Singapore.Even as we focus on our present needs, we must also plan for the future and think on behalf of generations to come.  We are here today only because of what previous generations of Singaporeans did. They were willing to work hard and make sacrifices, to give us â their children and grandchildren â a better life. We must uphold these same values and leave behind a Singapore that is better than the one today, for the sake of future generations.Climate change poses an existential threat to our island state. We have committed to decisive action to reduce carbon emissions and are taking resolute steps towards meeting our net-zero commitments. We also need to protect ourselves against global warming, especially rising sea levels. We are developing plans for more extensive coastal protection measures and will dove-tail these plans with our urban renewal strategies.All this requires responsible use of our fiscal resources and husbanding of our accumulated reserves. We must therefore continue to uphold our longstanding principles of fiscal prudence and discipline, so that future generations too will have the means to weather major storms and the wherewithal to build the Singapore of their dreams. Throughout our nation building journey, we have repeatedly faced challenges and setbacks. We survived when few believed we would. When we started out in 1965, the journey looked so daunting, with so many problems to solve. But with courage and determination, our founding leaders and pioneer generations tackled challenges head-on, one by one, and built this thriving metropolis. We are now in a much stronger position â better poised to overcome our vulnerabilities and armed with crucial resources to push forward with confidence, however stormy the weather.  Our collective experiences have strengthened the mutual trust between Singaporeans and their confidence in our system of government. This virtuous circle relies on us partnering one another and working together to make the impossible, possible.  The leadership transition to the 4G team is well underway. They have worked well together and proven their ability and grit through their handling of the COVID-19 crisis. They have also been engaging citizens widely through the Forward Singapore exercise. They must continue to strengthen their bonds with Singaporeans, and work closely with them to write the next chapter of our Singapore Story.  The trust between our political leadership and people, and between Singaporeans themselves, is a key strength we must continue to nurture and cherish. In so many societies, this has gone wrong. These societies face deep divides that are difficult to bridge. Instead of bringing people together, political parties aggravate rifts by divisive appeals for support from competing groups. Their political systems are stuck in gridlock. Consequently, trust in government and its institutions plummets, making recovery even harder.  We cannot afford to let this happen in Singapore. In an open, diverse society, people will always have different views. We must debate them honestly and robustly. But our conversations also must be constructive, respectful and responsible, based on facts and sound analysis. Our interactions with one another must be anchored on mutual respect and trust, and a shared goal of advancing the larger public interest. In this way, we can work through our differences, enlarge our common ground and draw strength from our diverse perspectives.  So far, we have done well. Out of our diversity, we have built a deep reservoir of social capital and trust. As we commemorate the centenary of Mr Lee Kuan Yewâs birth, we should reflect on the values and principles of the founding generation of leaders. We should reaffirm and uphold our shared values, while re-examining what needs to be updated and possessing the courage to break new ground. Only then can we forge ahead confidently, firm in our footing and sure of our destination. The COVID-19 experience shows what Singaporeans are capable of when we come together as a nation, and gives us quiet confidence and strength as we face the future together. Let us learn from this experience to work together to improve the lives of todayâs Singaporeans, keep faith with future generations yet unborn and build a Singapore that thrives and endures for many years to come.\n",
      "The Minister for Health (Mr Ong Ye Kung)\n",
      "The Ministry of Health (MOH) will continue to deliver good health outcomes for Singaporeans, while keeping costs affordable for individuals and sustainable for Singapore. We have been able to achieve these objectives through the delivery of high-quality care, supported by a dedicated healthcare workforce and resilient infrastructure built up over the years, and a S+3M (subsidies, MediSave, MediShield Life, and MediFund) system that instils financial discipline while providing a safety net for patients who need it. The COVID-19 crisis has given us new perspectives on our pandemic preparedness plans and public health capabilities. Furthermore, our population is ageing rapidly. Medical advancements are not only opening up new possibilities but also major challenges and dilemmas. Singaporeâs healthcare system is therefore at a pivotal phase of its transformation journey. MOH will strengthen our capabilities and structures by setting up a Communicable Diseases Agency to oversee disease preparedness, prevention and control, surveillance, risk assessment, and outbreak response. MOH will set up a permanent Crisis Strategy and Operations Group, to maintain surge readiness for mid-sized outbreaks and other health emergencies, and to prepare healthcare institutions to be crisis-ready. We will also maintain a healthcare reserve force, to expand surge capacity if necessary. MOH will continue to make progress on PREPARE, the Programme for Research in Epidemic Preparedness and Response, to develop our capabilities in global surveillance so we may better understand new and dangerous pathogens. We will implement our vaccine strategy, to secure an early supply of efficacious vaccines when another pandemic breaks out. We will also review the Infectious Diseases Act (IDA) to deal with a wider range of public health situations, and better manage crisis communications. We will continue to invest in healthcare infrastructure and expand our care capacity. This includes the Woodlands Health Campus, the Tan Tock Seng Hospital Integrated Care Hub, the Eastern Integrated Health Campus, and the redevelopment of Alexandra Hospital. In the next few years, we will add 1,900 (or about 20%) more public hospital beds, from 11,000 beds today. By 2030, we will build 10 more polyclinics, making a total of 32 polyclinics. We will also expand the capacity of our nursing homes from 16,000 beds in 2020 to more than 31,000 beds in 2030. We will invest heavily in IT, focusing on mission-critical national systems for hospital billing, drug ordering and dispensation, and the maintenance of national medical databases. We will continue to develop our healthcare workforce. We plan to increase our nursing and support care manpower by 40%, from 49,000 now to 69,000 by 2030, by building a stronger local pipeline through pre-employment training and mid-career conversions, and complementing our local core with foreign healthcare workers. With good training opportunities and career prospects, Singapore will remain competitive in attracting foreign healthcare manpower. More opportunities will be made available for doctors to become Family Physicians and develop their competencies, such as through postgraduate family medicine training. We will continue to upgrade the skills and knowledge of nurses and Allied Health Professionals, so that they can assume greater responsibilities, including in leading more clinical community care initiatives.While ageing and changes to our demography are inexorable, we can improve the health of our population through effective preventive care that spans the entire life of an individual. This will be a major focus in the coming years.Good health starts from the womb. We will enhance mental health screening and psycho-emotional support for pregnant women and their spouses, and support families in cultivating healthy lifestyle habits from young. As the child gets older, schools and preschools are important platforms to foster and sustain healthy habits. We will partner MOE and MSF closely, to incorporate health education in the school experience, and lay a strong foundation of health for our younger generation.  For adults, Healthier SG will be the key strategy to encourage healthy living and deliver preventive care. Enrolment into Healthier SG will start in July 2023, and this will kickstart the development of strong and dedicated patient-doctor relationships throughout society. Family doctors play an integral role in inculcating and strengthening good health habits, such a good diet, regular exercise, and routine health screenings and vaccinations. To support this effort, we are marshalling community resources and partners to organise physical activities in the community, and to reach out to residents and encourage them to enrol. Through the Health Promotion Board, we will continue to drive efforts to reduce sugar and sodium intake, equip consumers with information to make healthier eating choices, manage the consumption of tobacco and nicotine, and promote smoking cessation. By emphasising preventive care, Healthier SG brings healthcare out of hospitals and clinics, and into the community. We are therefore updating the Healthcare Services Act, to make regulations services-centric, instead of focusing on the premise where care is delivered. Similarly, we need to review our healthcare financing policies to make them more premise-neutral, and ensure support is available regardless of where care is sought. For our seniors we need to make ageing in community the default, because it is the best way for them to stay socially engaged and active, and hence healthy. As part of the Forward Singapore exercise, we are studying the specific measures to enable this. Broadly, our built environment must be made more senior-friendly, with new housing options such as Community Care Apartments, and existing common spaces such as void decks, parks, and coffee shops transformed into conducive environments for seniors. Our network of Active Ageing Centres will need to be expanded, and their operations remodelled, so that they can become nodes for seniors to make friends, volunteer, participate in active ageing programmes, and receive support for maintaining good health. As seniors approach end-of-life, we will seek to fulfil the wishes of the great majority to pass on in the comfort of their homes, surrounded by their loved ones. We will therefore strengthen support for palliative care by enhancing clinical protocols in hospitals to enable more seamless care transitions, upskilling healthcare workers, and engaging Singaporeans in conversations on their preferences. We will also enhance financial support for palliative care and ensure sufficient capacity across all settings to meet growing needs.We are in a period of major breakthroughs in medical science, especially in areas like precision medicine, gene editing, and artificial intelligence. For instance, with precision medicine, we can consider individual variations in genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors when predicting the health risks of individuals, and determine the most effective prevention and treatment strategies for them. At the same time, there will likely be a proliferation of experimental treatments, such as genetic therapies. We need to support and embrace technological advances but remain aware of the risks and pitfalls. Experimental treatments tend to work only on a small minority, so mass deployment of new treatments must be subject to evidence-based clinical development and evaluation of cost and medical effectiveness. Even as new medical technology becomes established, it will likely be costly and deployed only in specific circumstances. This would require a rethink of our healthcare financing policies, especially the role of medical insurance and MediShield Life. We may also need new legislation to safeguard moral and ethical standards in the practice of new medical technology such as precision medicine. MOH will undertake this long-term effort in partnership with researchers, physicians, economists, bioethicists, regulatory bodies, and the public, to reap the benefits of these new solutions. \n",
      "The Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee)\n",
      "The Ministry of National Development (MND) will continue to ensure that we develop sustainably, build an endearing home and a distinctive global city, and meet the diverse aspirations of Singaporeans. Through the Long-Term Plan Review and the Forward Singapore exercise, we engaged over 30,000 Singaporeans to understand their values, hopes, and concerns for the future, including what a refreshed social compact for public housing should look like. We will update our housing and planning strategies to reflect the concerns and aspirations of our time. These strategies will be translated into detailed land use and development plans for the next ten to fifteen years in the upcoming Master Plan review. While the construction sector was severely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have made good progress to get back on track. Across the Housing and Development Board (HDB)âs Build-To-Order programme and private residential developments, there will be almost 40,000 home completions in 2023, and close to 100,000 by 2025. We will continue to maintain a steady pipeline to meet housing demand, and adjust our policies as necessary to keep the property market stable and sustainable.Our public housing programme has enabled eight in 10 Singaporean households to live in HDB flats today. We must continue to update our public housing programmes and policies as our city develops and society matures. Nearly one in four Singaporeans will be 65 years and older by 2030. We also have more singles and caregivers in our society, and more young Singaporeans aspire to live independently. In addition, our public housing estates and HDB flats are ageing. Many non-mature estates have also become much more well-developed over time. We will refresh our social compact on housing, so that housing continues to be affordable and accessible, and our estates remain inclusive, cohesive and sustainable. (a) We are committed to supporting families. We will help young married couples and families with children buy their very first home. (b) We will keep public housing inclusive, including in our prime areas. We will continue to launch flats under the Prime Location Public Housing model. (c) We will pair housing with proactive social support to uplift lower income families and help them move towards home ownership. (d) We will develop a range of housing options and provide stronger support for singles, seniors, as well as persons with disabilities. (e) We will design and build estates to forge strong communities, bring Singaporeans closer together, and integrate how we live, work and play.(f) We will rejuvenate and upgrade existing housing estates to improve the quality of our living environment.(g) We will work together with Singaporeans to promote social norms in our neighbourhoods that reflect our values of mutual respect and care for one another. Ultimately, our new social compact on housing represents a consensus among Singaporeans on our priorities as a nation and how we should allocate finite land and limited resources to meet growing aspirations. We must also set aside enough land and resources for future generations, to meet their aspirations and needs. MND will continue to plan boldly for the long-term, carefully balancing different needs and executing detailed plans to keep our city-state green, vibrant, and inclusive. We will embark on big moves and create more space by transforming the Greater Southern Waterfront and relocating Paya Lebar Airbase so that new and sustainable towns can be built. We will continue to make concerted efforts to retain and weave in our uniquely Singaporean identity as we develop Singapore. We have evolved from a âGarden Cityâ to a âCity in a Gardenâ, and now aspire to be a City in Nature, where native flora and fauna thrive amid a flourishing, urban metropolis. We will secure and extend our natural capital for generations to enjoy, and continue to build a productive and vibrant city, while strengthening the distinctive character and heritage of our towns and neighbourhoods. We will design our districts to connect with our shared memories of the area, which amplifies our Singaporean identity and provides residents with a sense of belonging, ownership, and community. We will plan for a range of possibilities as far ahead as possible, and introduce greater flexibility and optionality in our land use plans, so we can respond nimbly to crises and challenges. By carefully pacing out development plans, we can also better respond to changes in land use needs. To protect our city from the effects of climate change, we will deploy both infrastructure and nature-based solutions. These plans need to be supported by a strong and progressive built environment sector. The refreshed Built Environment Industry Transformation Map reflects our resolve to design, construct, and maintain our buildings in a more productive and sustainable manner, while strengthening our resilience against future challenges. We will support the growth of stronger firms with deeper capabilities, reduce our reliance on foreign manpower, and streamline regulatory processes. We will also ramp up efforts to reduce building emissions as we move towards our national climate target of net zero emissions by 2050.We will continue to partner Singaporeans to ensure that Singapore remains a distinctive and thriving city, with inclusive neighbourhoods and endearing homes for all Singaporeans.\n",
      "The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M)\n",
      "The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) will strengthen families as the bedrock of our society. We will build a more caring and inclusive society, drawing on the strengths of individuals and families, the social capital within our communities, and resources from the public, people and private sectors, to provide a tapestry of support to uplift those in need. We will implement the Singapore Made For Families 2025 plan, which outlines the efforts of the Government, community partners, and businesses to create a Singapore where all families are valued and supported. We will strengthen the Families For Life (FFL) movement. FFL will establish a presence in all towns by 2025 in partnership with Family Service Centres (FSCs). This will provide families more convenient access to peer support groups, marriage preparation, parenting and grandparenting programmes at the local community level. For families that face more challenges, we will provide timely family-centric interventions such as marriage support for minor and young marriages, divorce support, and family counselling. We will do this through the nationwide network of 10 FSCs offering the Strengthening Families Programme. We will continue to invest heavily in the early childhood sector to provide all children access to affordable and quality preschools. By 2025, 80% of pre-schoolers can have a place in a Government-supported preschool with affordable fees. We will enhance training and career progression for early childhood educators, keep salaries and working conditions competitive, and maintain the high quality of preschool education.In our Forward Singapore conversations, parents expressed their desire for more options to care for their young children, especially infants. We will study new care options apart from infant care facilities, to meet varying preferences and needs. We will continue working towards our shared vision where men and women partner each other as equals. One key area is to encourage greater womenâs representation in leadership roles, building on the good progress made in raising the proportion of women on boards.We will enable persons with disabilities (PwDs) to live independent and fulfilling lives, through the Enabling Masterplan 2030. SG Enable will launch regional Enabling Business and Enabling Services hubs to provide employment support to, and bring social support services closer to PwDs and their caregivers. MSF will also expand capacity in early intervention services and make preschools more inclusive to support children with developmental needs. To foster a more caring and inclusive society, we will work with corporates and the community to shift mindsets and enhance support for families with PwDs in areas such as cost of care and post-school life. We will strengthen our social safety nets for lower-income families and enable them to bounce back stronger. ComCare will be regularly updated to reflect basic expenditure patterns of lower-income families.Early childhood development for children from lower-income families will start them on the right path. We will close the gap in preschool participation rates of children from lower-income families with their peers. We will scale up KidSTART nation-wide by 2026 and facilitate priority enrolment for children from lower-income families in Anchor Operator Preschools and MOE Kindergartens by age three.We will also ensure that social services are comprehensive, convenient, and coordinated so that vulnerable families can get the help they need quickly and easily. To this end, Community Link (ComLink) officers and volunteer befrienders have adopted a family-centric approach in supporting families with children living in rental housing. MSF will also be integrating social programmes under ComLink, such as KidSTART, UPLIFT Community Network, and Project Dian@M3. We are studying how to empower ComLink families to take further action to improve their circumstances and that of their children, by augmenting and supplementing their efforts to uplift themselves. Through Forward Singapore, we will strengthen partnerships with volunteers, the community, and corporates to help these families achieve stability, self-reliance, and social mobility. We will take a family-based approach to rehabilitate youth offenders, so that they can turn their lives around. We will also work with the community to protect families at risk of domestic violence. We have made it easier and more convenient for those experiencing or witnessing domestic violence to make reports, so that survivors can get help from social service professionals. We will amend the Womenâs Charter to better protect survivors and hold perpetrators accountable even as we support their rehabilitation. Twenty twenty-three is the Year of Celebrating Social Service Partners for the good work of social service agencies (SSAs), businesses, and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs). We will accord similar recognition to social service professionals and volunteers. We will continue to partner SSAs in their transformation and extend more support through the Community Capability Trust, so that their digitalisation processes, people practices, and volunteer management capabilities are future-ready. To ensure effective service delivery, we will prioritise funding for outcomes and improve data sharing and integrated case management through platforms such as Case Connect and One Client View. We will also reduce administrative and regulatory burden and streamline reporting requirements while still ensuring good governance. To grow the attractiveness of social service sector jobs, we will enhance skills training, guide SSAs to pay competitively through the updated NCSS Sector Salary Guidelines, and improve working conditions. Businesses and organisations have assets, expertise and networks they can creatively leverage to support their philanthropic efforts and create sustained social impact. MSF will partner businesses to strengthen the social impact in their Environmental, Social, and Governance policies. We will also strengthen collaborations with IHLs and academics to train social service professionals, and to undertake research to inform our policies and practices. We will create a Singapore made for families, give every child a good start, and help every family achieve stability, self-reliance and social mobility. Together, we can secure a better future for ourselves and our children.\n",
      "The Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing)\n",
      "The Ministry of Education (MOE) strives to enable all Singaporeans to realise their potential. We have been engaging our stakeholders as part of the Forward Singapore exercise. We will strengthen our partnerships with families, communities, and industry to refresh our system of meritocracy, so that all can thrive and contribute to Singapore in their own ways. MOE is committed to providing a quality education and a strong foundation for every child. In a complex and fast-changing world, our students will require diverse skillsets to stay resilient, and diverse perspectives to connect and collaborate with others in Singapore and elsewhere. MOE will thus continue to encourage holistic development and cultivate 21st Century Competencies. To meet the wider and more complex needs of our students, we will support our educators by giving them opportunities to broaden their perspectives and skillsets. We will also partner families and the community to provide holistic support for our childrenâs socio-emotional development.We have moved away from a one-size-fits-all approach to education, and from using a single metric to evaluate the diverse dimensions of our studentsâ abilities. Full Subject-Based Banding will be fully implemented in secondary schools next year and will allow every student to learn subjects at a level that caters to their strengths and learning needs. Our schools are building partnerships with their stakeholders to offer niche areas of excellence to cater to studentsâ diverse interests. We will also continue to expand admission routes to schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to recognise the different strengths and abilities of our students.Every child should have access to quality education, according to their needs, regardless of their starting point in life. We will continue to invest more in preschool education, especially for children from disadvantaged families. We will also step up our efforts to provide opportunities for learners of different backgrounds to interact, empathise with, and support one another. At the same time, to adapt to a changing global landscape, we will need to break new ground. First, amidst economic transformation and labour market disruptions, we must evolve our practices to create new value and stay ahead of the competition. To enable Singaporeans to seize new opportunities and stay employable, we will strengthen our SkillsFuture movement to better support continual upskilling and reskilling across an individualâs lifetime. This includes making training accessible for adult learners, developing new andragogical approaches, and working closely with companies, unions, and training institutions to tighten the nexus between business needs, workersâ skills and training. We will provide stronger support for mid-career workers, in particular, to reduce their opportunity cost for training should they require a substantial skills reboot. At the same time, our people will need to make full use of these opportunities by developing a growth mindset and passion for lifelong learning.Second, we will strengthen support for students with Special Educational Needs (SEN). We will continue to strengthen the educational experience for students with SEN in mainstream and Special Education (SPED) schools. MOE will work with Social Service Agencies to improve remuneration and career progression in the SPED sector. This will improve the quality of SPED and better enable our students to lead independent and meaningful lives.Third, we will leverage technology to better customise teaching and learning for students of different abilities. We will continue to invest in education technologies to bring out the best in each child. For example, adaptive learning platforms, powered by Artificial Intelligence, will allow more advanced learners to stretch themselves, while freeing up time for our teachers to focus on students with greater learning needs. All of us have a part to play in shaping and strengthening our social compact. Those who have done well in life should pay it forward, and support those who have less. Success must be defined not just by oneâs achievements, but also by how we contribute to the common good. By moving beyond the pursuit of paper qualifications and embracing a broader definition of success, our education system can bring out the best in every child and strengthen our resilience as a nation through our diversity of strengths.\n",
      "The Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng)\n",
      "As we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, economic and geopolitical uncertainties are expected to weigh on the labour market. To tackle these challenges, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) will redouble our efforts to expand opportunities, strengthen support and assurance, and foster fair, inclusive, and safe workplaces for Singaporeans. As part of the Forward Singapore exercise, MOM and the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) have been engaging Singaporeans from all walks of life. Many are concerned about staying relevant and competitive, and having job opportunities that match their aspirations.As our economy transforms, MOM will empower Singaporean workers to take charge of their careers and improve their career prospects and resilience. MOM has launched Jobs Transformation Maps to provide individuals with insights on how technology will affect their jobs and how they can proactively take measures to remain competitive and relevant. Singaporeans can also tap on employment facilitation programmes by Workforce Singapore to chart out their career paths. We will be launching CareersFinder, a feature on the MyCareersFuture portal, to help workers plan for their next career move using data and artificial intelligence. For workers who face displacement, we will help them in their job search. For those inclined towards âhands-onâ work, MOM will work with NTUC to professionalise skilled trades, to attract and retain more Singaporeans in such jobs through better salaries and clearer progression ladders. We have made headway in uplifting the image and attractiveness of skilled professions that work with the âheartâ, such as nursing and early childhood education. We must do likewise for trades that emphasise craft and skills mastery.MOM also aims to build up a stronger local pipeline for corporate leadership positions. We want to see more Singaporeans becoming specialists and leaders in their chosen fields of our economy and growing their careers in Singapore and on the global stage.MOM will also support employers to grow and transform. Only with strong companies can we have a vibrant economy and good job opportunities. To this end, we will support our local workforce to constantly improve, even as Singapore remains open to foreign manpower that complements locals. From September 2023, we will roll out the Complementarity Assessment Framework (COMPASS) for new Employment Pass (EP) applications. Through COMPASS, we will encourage companies to build strong and diverse teams, with Singaporeans and skilled EP holders working alongside and learning from one another. The COMPASS Shortage Occupation List allows firms to access applicants with highly specialised skills, while the Strategic Economic Priorities bonus facilitates applications from firms that support Singaporeâs strategic priorities. We will also support businesses that contribute to our strategic priorities with additional Work Permit and S Pass quotas via the Manpower for Strategic Economic Priorities scheme.Our growth has been and must continue to be inclusive. We have made progress in looking after vulnerable workers and will press on with our efforts. We will invest heavily to uplift the salaries and skills of lower-wage workers, and help them progress in their careers. By July 2023, up to nine in ten lower-wage workers will benefit from Progressive Wages (PWs). We have also enhanced the Workfare Income Supplement scheme to increase maximum payments and expand coverage to half a million lower-wage workers. With the recently launched PW Mark, consumers and corporate buyers can play their part to support firms that pay progressive wages. Seniors who want and are able to continue working should have maximum access to employment opportunities. We have been raising the retirement and re-employment ages progressively, and have extended the Senior Employment Credit and Part-time Re-employment Grant until 2025 to provide employers with wage offsets. In addition, we have enhanced the Enabling Employment Credit to raise wage offsets to employers who hire unemployed persons with disabilities. We have also introduced a new Uplifting Employment Credit to incentivise firms to hire ex-offenders. A substantial group of workers provide services, such as deliveries and vehicle rides, via digital platforms. They need better protection. We have accepted the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Platform Workers and will require platform companies to provide platform workers with work injury compensation and Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions. Platform workers will also be able to seek formal representation and negotiate for their collective interests.A decade ago, about five in ten active CPF members were able to attain their cohort Basic Retirement Sum at age 55. This has improved to almost seven in ten today and is expected to reach about eight in ten in 2027.We are undertaking a fundamental review of our policies for retirement adequacy under the Forward Singapore exercise. We will bolster retirement adequacy and make sure the CPF system continues to work for the broad majority of Singaporeans. We will raise the CPF monthly salary ceiling to keep pace with rising incomes, which will help middle-income workers save more during their working years. Ultimately, we seek to assure all Singaporeans that as long as they work and contribute consistently to their CPF, they will be able to meet their basic retirement needs. We will also find ways to look after those who are unable to work consistently or who have a shorter runway of working years.MOM will continue to foster fair, inclusive, and safe workplaces, shape workplace norms, and ensure an even playing field for all.Employers must pay attention to fair consideration when hiring. We will require employers, by law, to advertise jobs on MyCareersFuture and fairly consider all candidates, before applying for an EP or S Pass. We will enact workplace fairness legislation to provide stronger protection against workplace discrimination and enable workers to seek redress for harm done. We will also continue to shape the right norms to help make our workplace practices more flexible. By 2024, we will introduce Tripartite Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs) to help employers and employees adopt FWAs in a win-win manner. Even one workplace death is one too many. We remain committed to advancing workplace safety and health, and will strive towards our 2028 target to reduce the workplace fatal injury rate to below 1.0 per 100,000 workers. MOM must continue to be both pro-worker and pro-business. We will build on the strong foundation of tripartism to journey hand-in-hand, step-by-step with all workers and businesses towards a better future.\n",

      "The Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) seeks to enhance opportunities, sustain trust and strengthen our communities to reap the full benefits of digital and technological advances, while mitigating the potential harms. MCI will work with partners to develop a new Digital Connectivity Blueprint for strategic, sustainable, and future-ready digital infrastructure. We will also continue investing in research and innovation, including in quantum technologies and artificial intelligence, as part of Singaporeâs Research, Innovation, and Enterprise 2025 Plan. These efforts to enhance digital infrastructure and encourage innovation are the foundation for our businesses and people to thrive in a digital age. MCI will continue to support digital transformation of our businesses, particularly to help Small-Medium Enterprises improve their productivity and access new markets. MCI will scale adoption of digital utilities that support core business functions, such as e-payment and e-invoicing. MCI will also refresh the schemes to help firms improve their cybersecurity posture and raise their overall digital maturity. These will be brought together under the new Digital Enterprise Blueprint, a comprehensive guide to the Governmentâs support for enterprise digitalisation. We will also work with partners to shape international rules, benchmarks, and norms, through Digital Economy Agreements and other initiatives. MCI will continue to help Singaporeans raise their digital proficiencies, both to access digital services and navigate confidently online, as well as to access good opportunities in tech. Initiatives under the Information and Communications Jobs Transformation Map will equip tech workers with the tools to stay competitive. We will also help workers, both within the information and communications sector and across the economy, upskill and deepen their proficiencies in high-demand areas such as 5G, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity. As part of the Forward Singapore exercise, we will work with the Ministry of Manpower and Ministry of Education, as well as industry partners, to ensure that good opportunities remain accessible to all, through initiatives such as the TechSkills Accelerator for ITE and Polytechnics Alliance.Trust among our people, and in our institutions and systems, is essential to the continued vitality and resilience of our society and economy. MCI takes a comprehensive approach to building and strengthening trust.MCI will continue to protect users from harmful online content, with codes of practice for social media services and app stores, and advisory guidelines for the protection of personal data. Through the Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy 2021, MCI and the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore will also enhance efforts to protect our critical information infrastructure and other important systems and entities from cyber threats, and raise the cybersecurity posture of companies and individuals through the Cybersecurity Labelling Scheme and Cybersecurity Trust and Essentials Mark certification programmes. MCI, together with partners from industry, academia, and the community, will grow the digital, information, and media literacy of Singaporeans, and promote better social cohesion, wellness, and health outcomes. MCI will continue to coordinate Whole-of-Government public communications on major national issues to ensure that the public receives timely and accurate information. MCI will also support efforts to protect public interest and trust by providing the public with a reliable source for facts, addressing misperceptions, and alerting the public to scams and other threats.MCI is committed to building and strengthening our Singapore communities in both offline and online spaces. We will continue to provide timely, accessible, and inclusive Government communications, through in-person engagements as well as traditional and digital media platforms, to reach Singaporeans from all walks of life. We will also engage the community through REACH, to better understand stakeholdersâ views, needs, and aspirations.All Singaporeans should be able to participate meaningfully in society and reap the benefits of digital technologies, regardless of ability or personal circumstances. MCI will expand its digital inclusion efforts by:(a) providing subsidised devices and internet access under the DigitalAccess@Home and Mobile Access for Seniors schemes; (b) offering tailored training and assistance for the elderly and other groups through the Info-communications Media Development Authorityâs SG Digital Office; (c) organising outreach efforts under the National Library Boardâs Libraries and Archives Blueprint 2025; and (d) mounting people, private and public partnerships under the Digital for Life movement. Access to credible sources of information and content that reflect our Singapore voice and values is vital to our social cohesion, cultural heritage, and national identity. MCI will support the creation and delivery of high-quality news and content across various media platforms and languages to the public. We will also continue efforts to implement subtitling or sign language interpretations for more free-to-air television programmes.MCI is committed to doing our part, alongside the public and our partners, to meet the challenges ahead and build a thriving digital future for all.\n",
      "The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Gan Kim Yong)\n",
      "Even as Singaporeâs economy emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic, new challenges have surfaced. In the near-term, persistent global inflation and a weak global demand outlook will weigh on Singaporeâs growth. We will also need to respond to major structural shifts, including an increasingly fragmented geopolitical landscape, accelerating disruptions from emerging technologies, and the global momentum on climate change. Domestically, we will need to pursue economic growth amidst tighter manpower, land and carbon constraints. The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) will step up efforts to grow Singaporeâs economy, create good jobs and support businesses and workers in seizing new opportunities. We can turn the challenges ahead into opportunities. Through the way we managed the pandemic, we have proven to businesses and investors that we are reliable partners. The Government will continue to build on our strong fundamentals of efficient infrastructure, extensive connectivity, a highly skilled workforce, and an enabling policy environment, to capture growth opportunities. MTI will press on with our journey towards the Singapore Economy 2030 vision to achieve longer-term, sustainable growth, by expanding our trade, capturing opportunities in the manufacturing and services sectors, and uplifting our enterprises and workers. We will also implement the plans under the Industry Transformation Maps 2025 to strengthen our industries and workforce capabilities.Singapore must continue to remain open, expand our economic space and stay connected to global growth opportunities. Even as other countries adopt more protectionist measures, Singapore will expand and diversify our trading activities and markets, capture more re-exports and transhipments, and embed Singapore deeper into global supply chains. This strengthens our relevance as a global business hub and anchors high-value economic activities and good jobs here. We will also strengthen our international partnerships to capture new opportunities, arising from Asiaâs growth and global trends in digital trade and sustainability. Our growth strategies must be coupled with efforts to secure economic resilience amid heightened risk of global supply chain disruptions. MTI will coordinate supply chain resilience efforts across government to secure critical supplies for Singapore.MTI will help our industries capture opportunities in growth areas and support them in their transformation journey to become more productive and competitive. We will build a strong base of advanced manufacturing industries, including by leveraging technologies such as biotechnology and robotics. Capitalising on global sustainability and digitalisation trends, we will strengthen Singaporeâs position as a leading international green hub and seize opportunities in the digital economy. We will also strengthen the nexus between research, innovation and commercialisation to enhance Singaporeâs competitive advantage. At the same time, we will address our carbon, land, and manpower resource constraints. We will secure alternative forms of low-carbon energy and support enterprises to improve energy efficiency and reduce their carbon footprint. We will maximise the economic value from the use of industrial land and continue to attract global talent and rainmakers with skills that are complementary to our workforce.Thriving enterprises and an agile workforce are crucial to our next phase of growth. MTI will work closely with industry stakeholders to empower businesses to transform and workers to upskill to seize opportunities. We will deepen enterprisesâ research and development capabilities and capacity for market-oriented innovation so they can respond more effectively to the changing operating context. We will lower barriers to entry by streamlining regulations and improving service delivery. We will, through a bespoke approach, help promising enterprises internationalise and grow into future Singapore Global Enterprises. Enterprises will also receive support to develop capabilities in sustainability.  Our people are the core of our economy. MTI will work with the Ministry of Manpower and Ministry of Education to equip our people with industry-relevant skillsets and ensure better alignment of training to industry needs. MTI will focus our efforts to drive economic growth and create good jobs. We will work with stakeholders to uplift enterprises and workers to capture opportunities and chart the path towards a prosperous and vibrant Singapore.\n",
      "The Senior Minister, Coordinating Minister for Social Policies and Minister-in-charge of The Monetary Authority of Singapore (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam)\n",
      "The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) seeks to secure sustained non-inflationary economic growth, a robust and resilient financial sector, and Singaporeâs position as a leading international financial centre in Asia.Major central banks have increased interest rates at an unprecedented pace amid persistent inflationary pressures. Tighter financial conditions globally are helping to dampen inflation, at the cost of slower economic growth and increased financial market stresses. Downside risks to global growth have increased, even as continuing labour market pressures keep inflation elevated. Against this backdrop, the Singapore economy will expand at a slower pace in 2023. Inflation is expected to moderate during the year but will remain higher than the historical norm.MAS has steadily tightened monetary policy since October 2021. This has helped to dampen inflation and anchor inflation expectations. MAS will continue to focus on ensuring medium-term price stability as the basis for sustained economic growth.Amid volatile international financial markets and stresses in global banking, MAS will seek to safeguard the safety and resilience of Singaporeâs financial sector. Through regular risk assessments and close supervisory monitoring, MAS ensures that banks in Singapore are well-capitalised, keep healthy liquidity positions, and are underpinned by a stable and diversified funding base. In addition, MAS reviews banksâ regular internal stress tests against interest rate, credit and other risks. MAS also conducts an annual industry-wide stress test of key financial institutions in Singapore. MAS stands ready to provide liquidity through a range of facilities to ensure that Singaporeâs financial system remains stable and financial markets continue to function in an orderly manner at times of global stress.MAS has partnered the financial industry to develop the Industry Transformation Map (ITM) 2025. It sets out five key growth strategies for the financial sector for 2021 to 2025: enhance asset class strengths, digitalise financial infrastructure, catalyse Asiaâs net-zero transition, shape the future of financial networks, and foster a skilled and adaptable workforce. The ITM aims to achieve growth of 4%-5% and net job creation of 3,000 to 4,000 per year for the financial services sector, over the five-year period. The financial sector is on track to achieving these targets, growing by an average 4.8% per year and adding an average 7,300 jobs per year during 2021 to 2022.MAS will catalyse insurance risk advisory and alternative risk transfer solutions for Asia. We will position Singapore as Asiaâs centre for philanthropy by building philanthropy advisory competencies and solutions. We will develop private credit to complement private equity and venture capital funding. MAS will anchor promising FinTech start-ups in Web 3.0, artificial intelligence, and green FinTech. We will also continue to work with the financial industry to broaden and deepen the electronic foreign exchange trading ecosystem in Singapore.We will help develop an ecosystem of stakeholders to mobilise capital and support Asiaâs transition to a net-zero emissions future. We will develop clear taxonomy criteria to identify green and transition activities for eight key sectors in 2023. We will promote the scaling up of blended and transition finance, to facilitate the decarbonisation of key sectors of the economy. We will also enhance sustainability disclosures and develop data utilities which will facilitate corporate disclosures and investorsâ access to companiesâ Environmental, Social, and Governance data.From the angle of financial stability, MAS will also work with the industry to enhance its resilience to the risks posed by climate change.Together with industry partners, MAS will accelerate efforts to develop new digital infrastructure and platforms to enhance industry efficiency, access new markets, and promote new models in digital finance. In bond markets, we will develop infrastructure to facilitate more seamless end-to-end issuance, listing and settlement for Asian securities transactions. In the funds industry, we will work with industry participants to pilot digital utilities to reduce settlement time, enhance the efficiency and transparency of post-trade funds settlement for fund managers.MAS will continue to enhance cross-border payment connectivity with key partner jurisdictions. We have established bilateral real-time cross-border payment linkages with Thailand and India, and are currently working with Malaysia on a similar linkage. MAS is also working with the Bank for International Settlements Innovation Hub on a multilateral solution to link fast payment systems within ASEAN. Through these linkages, users in Singapore and our partner jurisdictions are now able to transfer funds directly to one anotherâs bank accounts or e-wallets almost instantly using a mobile number or Quick Response code. Together with the industry, MAS will help evolve an innovative and responsible digital asset ecosystem. We are exploring the potential of distributed ledger technology in promising use cases, particularly in cross-border payment and settlement, trade finance, and pre- and post-trade capital market activities. We are also working with the industry to explore the potential of tokenisation of financial and real economy assets. MAS and the Institute of Banking & Finance will work closely with the industry and tripartite partners to continuously upskill the financial sector workforce and develop deep capabilities for the future of finance.We will build competencies in growth areas, provide training support for finance professionals at different stages of their careers, develop specialist talent in areas, such as sustainability and technology, and groom future leaders in finance through opportunities to gain international exposure and build valuable networks.\n",
      "The Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies and Chairman of the National Research Foundation (Mr Heng Swee Keat)\n",
      "The National Research Foundation (NRF) seeks to build a thriving Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) ecosystem that drives an innovation economy and addresses Singaporeâs national imperatives. Over the years, our RIE investments have benefited Singapore and Singaporeans. Investments in biomedical sciences and medical technology since the 1990s have set the foundation for the flourishing sectors they are today. As of 2020, Singapore hosts more than 30 regional headquarters (HQs) in the sector, many of which are from the worldâs top pharmaceutical and med-tech firms. The biomedical sector supports 25,000 jobs and makes up almost 4% of our GDP.We will support the next bound of Singaporeâs economic transformation by advancing Singaporeâs capabilities in strategic technology areas. This will unlock new opportunities for growth and create good jobs for Singaporeans. For example, in the area of semiconductors, our public research institutes and universities are collaborating with industry through corporate laboratories and joint projects, to work on new materials, designs, and manufacturing techniques that can drive the next generation of more efficient and powerful chips. These innovations will enable advances in wide-ranging applications such as wearables, communications equipment and vehicles, and expand the base of semiconductor manufacturing activities and jobs in Singapore. Artificial intelligence (AI) is another technology with transformative potential. We will continue to attract top AI talent and spur the development of innovative AI solutions that generate value for businesses and society. We will continue to support transformation efforts of businesses across industry sectors by creating new and improved solutions that leverage science and technology. We are scaling up platforms that bring together our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), public research institutes and industry, so that technological advancements in areas, such as medical diagnostics and additive manufacturing, are more quickly commercialised. Companies can also establish corporate laboratories with our public research performers to address their industry challenges or tap on Centres of Innovation for technical and business advisory to support their journey to become product builders. We will also strengthen Singapore's position as an attractive Global-Asia node for businesses to conduct research and development (R&D) and innovation, tapping on our diverse workforce, vibrant RIE ecosystem, and connections to fast-growing markets. This will build on the growth in Singapore's Business Expenditure on Research & Development, which has risen from about S$1.9 billion in 2000 to about S$6.6 billion in 2020. Many large corporations and multinationals have anchored their R&D centres in Singapore. Small-Medium Enterprises are also growing their innovation ambition and capabilities by tapping on capabilities in the IHLs and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), and on platforms, such as the Global Innovation Alliance, which provide access to enterprise partners, talent and markets in international innovation hubs. Our startup ecosystem continues to grow, with a more than 20-fold increase in venture capital funding raised in Singapore, from about S$500 million in 2011 to about S$11 billion in 2022. This includes promising deep-tech startups. In the next phase, as part of the Singapore Global Enterprises Initiative to build more locally-grown, high-growth and globally competitive companies, we will provide customised financial support for promising enterprises to build sustained R&D and innovation capacity.In addition to its economic importance, RIE has been critical in addressing Singaporeâs challenges in areas, such as public health and resource resilience. Our R&D capabilities in biomedical sciences and infectious diseases enabled us to respond to COVID-19 quickly. Singapore was one of the first countries to successfully culture the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We also developed several diagnostic test-kits that were rapidly deployed for use both locally and overseas. Our early investments to diversify our water sources, such as creating and adapting technologies for NEWater and desalination, have also helped make our water supply more secure and resilient.We will continue to invest in R&D to tackle ongoing and future challenges, for instance, to improve our pandemic preparedness by bolstering our vaccine development capabilities. To respond to the existential threat of climate change, we are deepening our investments in low carbon energy research and strengthening our climate adaptation R&D efforts, including by investing in coastal protection and flood management research. Food resilience is another pressing area. We are investing in food R&D particularly in aquaculture, urban agriculture, alternative proteins, and food safety, to strengthen our food security while reaping economic benefits. A robust talent pool is a key enabler for good RIE investment outcomes. The number of public and industry researchers in Singapore more than doubled from 20,000 in 2000 to 46,000 in 2020. We will continue to build a strong core of local research talent by nurturing our youthsâ interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields, and providing diverse pathways for those who wish to take up research careers. As a small nation and global city, we must remain open to top international talent. We are expanding our global collaborations in research and innovation to address complex problems that cannot be solved by one country alone, including through the Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE), a collaborative research hub with foreign universities and international research organisations. We will also continue to enhance the porosity of research talent across academia, public research institutes and industry, for instance, by seconding public researchers to local enterprises. We are working with industry to enhance their research capacity, through initiatives such as the Industrial Postgraduate Programme which provide opportunities for postgraduate students to undertake industrial R&D projects with companies. To grow the pool of deep-tech talent with Innovation & Enterprise and technology commercialisation skills, we also have on-the-job training programmes, which are accessible to mid-career professionals.Our RIE investments have created a strong foundation for Singapore to remain competitive amidst rapid technological changes. We must continue to leverage and build Singaporeâs science and technology capabilities to meet imminent needs and challenges, capture new economic opportunities and support our businesses and workforce.\n",
      "The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen)\n",
      "A strong defence safeguards Singaporeâs sovereignty and ensures peace and security for Singaporeansâ pursuit of economic and social progress.The geopolitical and security landscape Singapore faces is becoming more volatile and complex. Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine and rising contestation between the United States and China have reduced trust among countries. Divisions are rising in different spheres, while the multilateral rules-based order that has underpinned cross-border cooperation and conflict resolution is unravelling. Access to a growing range of sophisticated technologies has enabled malicious actors to pose significant security threats, including terrorist acts, hostile information campaigns, and cyberattacks on critical infrastructure.Amidst these turbulent times, steady and long-term investment in a strong defence is critical. The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and SAF are transforming to deter and defend against emerging and evolving threats in multiple domains, across the spectrum from peace to war. New and more advanced aerial, maritime, and land platforms will be introduced. These include a new fleet of twelve F-35B Joint Strike Fighter aircraft and four Invincible-class submarines by the early 2030s, as well as next-generation Howitzers and Armoured Tracked Carriers. The newly formed Digital and Intelligence Service (DIS) will expand the SAFâs digital capabilities and play a critical role in Singaporeâs national defence against cyber and information threats. Technology remains a key force multiplier for the SAF. We will employ more unmanned platforms to extend the reach and survivability of our forces. For more timely and accurate operational decision-making, the SAF will build up its digital capabilities and deploy data analytics and artificial intelligence in future command and control information systems. The DIS will develop a digital range to train our forces under realistic cyberattack scenarios and set up a Digital Ops-Tech Centre to enable our operational and defence technology workforces to collaborate on new digital solutions. Beyond utilising military technologies, we will expand our use of âdual-useâ technologies and collaborate with a wider range of technology partners. We are also enhancing our training infrastructure to maintain the SAFâs edge. Phase 1 of SAFTI City will be operationalised from 2024 to support training in complex urban environments. By the end of this year, the SAFâs new Instrumented Battle Circuits will provide more realistic training under simulated artillery bombardment and air strikes, allowing our soldiers to hone operational instincts and tactical fundamentals. Our investments in overseas facilities such as the Shoalwater Bay Training Area in Australia will allow the SAF to conduct large-scale exercises that cannot be replicated locally. Even as it enhances training effectiveness, the SAF will not compromise on the safety of our servicemen. The SAFâs adoption of an enterprise Safety Information System will enable important safety reminders and lessons to reach its service personnel quickly. Through the newly launched Heat Resilience and Performance Centre, we will conduct research to better prevent heat injury and boost our soldiersâ resilience against heat stress amid rising global temperatures. NS is the bedrock of Singaporeâs defence. We will continue to strengthen the NS system. We will maximise the contributions of our national servicemen by reviewing our medical classification system, expanding work-learn schemes for our Full-Time National Servicemen, and redesigning vocational roles. Operationally Ready National Servicemen will also see expanded opportunities to apply their civilian expertise in operational contexts. We will also improve the NS experience, by reviewing policies and procedures and deploying technology to make NS processes and services more efficient and convenient, so that national servicemen can focus on training to remain operationally ready. We will also continue to enhance support and recognition for our national servicemen. As a small nation state, we must uphold a global order and regional security architecture that is based on openness, inclusivity, and adherence to international law and norms. We will build trust, facilitate constructive dialogue, and encourage practical cooperation through multilateral platforms including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Defence Ministersâ Meeting (ADMM) and ADMM-Plus, Shangri-La Dialogue, and Singapore Defence Technology Summit. We have launched the ADMM Cybersecurity and Information Centre of Excellence to promote research and information sharing on emerging cybersecurity and information threats. Bilaterally, we will continue to strengthen defence relations with our neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia. We will also expand cooperation with partners such as Australia, China, India, and the United States, through high-level dialogue, military-to-military exchanges, and joint training.Every Singaporean has a part to play in keeping our home peaceful, safe, and secure. We will pursue new ways to encourage Singaporeans to participate actively in Total Defence. Building on the 2023 Total Defence Community Exercise, we will partner more communities to enhance individual and collective emergency preparedness and resilience in the face of potential crises. We will encourage more ground-up initiatives from Singaporeans to put Total Defence into action. Our defence and military museums are being revamped, and a new NS Gallery will open by 2027 to bring our defence story to life for Singaporeans.By working together and remaining committed to the defence of our nation, we will continue to safeguard our security, sovereignty and way of life.\n",
      "The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan)\n",
      "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) upholds Singaporeâs sovereignty, while advancing the interests of Singapore internationally and providing consular services to Singaporeans. Our mission remains constant, even as the world has become more complex and dangerous. Russiaâs invasion of its neighbour Ukraine is a striking reminder that we must never take our independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity for granted.The rules-based multilateral order, which has underpinned global peace and prosperity, is under severe strain. Even as we emerge from the COVID-19 crisis, we see a perfect storm of multiple overlapping and interrelated crises in the security, economic, public health, climate, technological, and socio-political domains. Superpower rivalry between the United States (US) and China continues to sharpen, with increasing risks of mishaps and geopolitical miscalculations. To navigate this increasingly fractured global order while seizing new opportunities for Singaporeans, Singaporeâs foreign policy must continue to be guided by our long-term national interests that are well understood and supported by our people.Our relations with our immediate neighbours remain important. We continue to work closely with them to deepen ties and expand cooperation in emerging areas. With Malaysia, the priority is to enhance our peoplesâ lives and livelihoods through projects like the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System Link. At the same time, we will manage our differences pragmatically and constructively. Having ratified the agreements under the Expanded Framework between Singapore and Indonesia, we are exploring opportunities to collaborate on future-oriented issues with Indonesia, such as the digital economy, sustainable development, and human resource development, and the green economy including the energy transition. Singapore has also worked closely with Indonesia in the multilateral arena, including supporting its successful G20 Presidency last year, and its ASEAN Chairmanship this year to advance ASEAN integration. Singapore has a special and unique relationship with Brunei, with whom we are also expanding cooperation in education, the green economy, and supply chain resilience.MFA forges overlapping circles of friends as embodied in the open, inclusive, and ASEAN-centred regional architecture. The innermost circle comprises our immediate neighbours and ASEAN, which remains a cornerstone of our foreign policy. ASEAN-led mechanisms like the East Asia Summit, ASEAN Regional Forum, ASEAN Plus-Three, and the Plus-One summits bring all major powers and regional players, including the US, China, and India, to the same table. We welcome the interest of major powers to engage ASEAN on our own merits, and to take clear stakes in the peace, stability, and development of our region, which will create a stable balance of power in the Asia Pacific. Beyond our immediate neighbourhood, we work with other partners around the world to advance our shared interests and address common challenges. We continue to champion common causes with the other 107 members of the Forum of Small States. Our Singapore Cooperation Programme, which has seen the participation of close to 150,000 foreign officials, continues to evolve to meet the needs of fellow developing countries. For instance, we launched our new Sustainability Action Package to support developing countriesâ priorities in sustainability and climate change.An inclusive and rules-based multilateral system is key to Singaporeâs survival and prosperity as a small island city-state with unique vulnerabilities. We will continue to advocate adherence to, and strengthening of, multilateralism and international law. We will also continue making constructive contributions to emerging rules and norms governing the global commons, including in climate change and sustainability, cyberspace and outer space. For example, we have just successfully concluded negotiations under Singaporeâs Presidency on a new United Nations Agreement on Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction. Amidst the pushback against globalisation and free trade, we must continue to press ahead with global economic integration and seize opportunities in emerging areas. Singapore has been working with like-minded partners such as Australia, Republic of Korea, United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Chile, on pathfinding initiatives, such as the modular and project-based Digital Economy Agreements and Green Economy Agreements. We encourage plurilateral initiatives, such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which facilitate trade cooperation and promote a forward-looking economic agenda.With the easing of COVID-19 travel restrictions worldwide, we expect greater demand for consular services as more Singaporeans resume travelling, and some may encounter problems or difficulties overseas. MFA will meet this increased demand and deliver consular services to all Singaporeans promptly and effectively, by harnessing technology as well as through a new corps of professional first responders trained to provide 24/7 consular response and assistance to Singaporeans. National unity is essential for Singaporeâs survival. Heightened geopolitical tensions have exacerbated the risk of foreign interference in our public discourse and shaping of opinions on global and domestic policies. We will continue to engage fellow Singaporeans on our foreign policy principles, so that they have a clear-eyed understanding of Singaporeâs long-term national interests and vulnerabilities. With understanding, trust, and support from our citizens, Singapore will be on a stronger footing to chart our own course and act in our best interests.Despite the fraught external environment, we have invaluable strengths, including our reputation for stability and policy consistency, as well as high levels of public trust and support â which we do not take for granted. We will continue to safeguard and shore up our resilience and unity as Singaporeans, in Singapore or overseas, to navigate the challenges and seize the opportunities ahead.\n",
      "The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam)\n",
      "The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and its Departments work as one Home Team to keep Singapore safe and secure. To fulfil our mission, we regularly update our laws, leverage technology extensively to enhance operational effectiveness, train and develop our officers for emerging challenges, and build partnerships with the public and international community.Singapore remains one of the safest countries in the world. In 2022, we were ranked first in Gallupâs Global Law and Order Report, for the seventh time since 2015. To continue keeping Singapore safe and secure, we need to address significant and emerging threats. First, terrorism continues to be a pressing and real threat. Second, criminal syndicates are making sophisticated use of technology to operate across national boundaries, resulting in notable increases in online scams and cybercrimes. Third, psychoactive substances and more liberal attitudes internationally towards drug use pose challenges to our efforts to keep Singapore drug-free. Furthermore, we must continue to safeguard Singaporeâs social cohesion, in particular our racial and religious harmony, which has anchored our countryâs peace and progress. We will update our laws to deal with emerging threats. We have consolidated gambling-related legislation under the Gambling Control Act, and formed the new Gambling Regulatory Authority, to enable a more holistic and coherent approach to gambling regulation. We have amended the Misuse of Drugs Act to introduce a new legislative framework for psychoactive substances.In the near term, we will introduce new legislation to better protect Singaporeans from online criminal activity, including scams and malicious cyber activity. We will strengthen the ability of our law enforcement agencies to deal with money mules who assist in the laundering of scam proceeds and to curb abuse of Singpass credentials to perpetrate scams. We will also introduce the Maintenance of Racial Harmony Act, to encourage moderation and tolerance among different racial groups, and to signal the overriding importance of racial harmony to Singapore. The Home Team will continue to leverage technology such as data analytics, robotics, and unmanned systems to increase operational effectiveness, reduce operational risks, and enable Home Team officers to focus on higher value tasks.The Immigration & Checkpoints Authorityâs New Clearance Concept (NCC) automates passenger, conveyance, and cargo clearance. In the near future, all residents, long-term pass holders, and departing visitors will be able to clear immigration without needing to present their passport. NCC will leverage data analytics and artificial intelligence to enhance detection of anomalies and security-sensitive items in conveyance and cargo clearance.The Singapore Police Force (SPF) is planning to expand camera coverage across Singapore and leverage video analytics to enhance sense-making.The Singapore Prison Service (SPS) is trialling a first-of-its-kind system â Prison Automated Screening System (PASS) â to automate urine sample collection and testing. This improves efficiency and accuracy, and also requires fewer officers for supervision.SPF and the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) are already deploying unmanned systems in various operational settings. SPF uses robots to augment Police patrols and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for crowd management and search operations. SCDF has been enhancing its firefighting operations with its fleet of unmanned ground vehicles. We are also trialling UAVs which can be operated remotely from a central command and control centre. This way, SPF and SCDF commanders can receive visuals of the scene even before officers arrive, allowing them to better plan their response.Advancements in technology will change the way the Home Team operates. To prepare our officers for evolving job roles, we will continue to invest heavily in their training, particularly in the area of digital technologies. The Home Team Academy will strengthen the Home Teamâs training and learning ecosystem, such as by further developing and deploying systems for effective and realistic simulation training. Home Team officers deal with stressful situations as part of their work. We will continue to strengthen resilience and stress management, and foster a culture of support for the mental health and well-being of officers in the Home Team.The spread of radical ideology online has fuelled the self-radicalisation threat in Singapore, especially for susceptible young individuals. Public vigilance and preparedness through the SGSecure movement continues to be a key pillar of our defence. We will continue to engage neighbourhoods, workplaces, and schools to sensitise, train and mobilise our community to play a part to prevent and deal with any terrorist attacks.A vigilant and discerning public is our best defence against scams. MHA has launched a new national anti-scam campaign to encourage the public to act against scams. We will launch a Scam Public Education Office to drive and expand our outreach and communication efforts.Our networks of volunteers and advocates are critical to amplifying the Home Teamâs effectiveness. SCDF is enhancing the Community First Response framework through leveraging technology to improve response to cases via SCDFâs myResponder App, and will be installing fire extinguishers at HDB lift lobbies to equip the community to respond to minor fires. SPF has rolled out the Community Watch Scheme, which seeks to build an informed and vigilant community. The Central Narcotics Bureau, together with the National Council Against Drug Abuse, has broadened its community outreach through collaborations with various organisations and enhanced training for volunteers and advocates under the A3 (Anti-Drug Abuse Advocacy) Network.SPS and Yellow Ribbon Singapore (YRSG) will better support the rehabilitation and reintegration of ex-offenders by expanding collaborations with community partners to help ex-offenders through training and employment assistance. To enhance ex-offendersâ career prospects, YRSG has shifted from a training and job placement model to one that emphasises skills for long-term career development, through career coaching, partnerships with stakeholders, and enhanced access to career resources.Given the rising volume and complexity of transnational crimes and security threats, including scams and terrorism, it is imperative we work more closely with the international community. We will strengthen our bilateral relationships, and work constructively with and through multilateral organisations such as the International Criminal Police Organisation (INTERPOL), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the United Nations. With the support of Singaporeans, the Home Team will strive to keep Singapore a safe and secure home for all.\n",
      "The Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien)\n",
      "Sustainability has always been part of Singaporeâs development journey as we set out to create a clean, green, and liveable environment amid Singaporeâs urban transformation. Through the Singapore Green Plan 2030, we renewed our commitment to put sustainability and resilience at the heart of our plans, to build a future-ready Singapore that continues to thrive in a world characterised by climate change, resource constraints, and growing uncertainties. The Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) will continue working with Singaporeans to steward a sustainable and resilient Singapore for future generations, in line with aspirations conveyed through the Forward Singapore exercise.The Singapore Green Plan charts out concrete policies and actions for Singapore to decarbonise and achieve our net-zero ambition, and how the Government, businesses, community, and individuals can work together towards a greener future. The Government will enable this green transition by working with all segments of society to change our mindsets, habits, and behaviours, and supporting the creation of new sustainable business models and green jobs.To accelerate our low-carbon transition, the carbon tax will be raised progressively from $5 per tonne now to $50 â $80 per tonne by 2030. To ensure an inclusive transition, we will continue supporting enterprises and households to become more energy-efficient and reduce their carbon footprint, through schemes like the Energy Efficiency Fund and Climate Friendly Households Programme. We will continue to advance effective international collaboration to support our decarbonisation efforts, such as in carbon markets, carbon capture usage and storage, a regional power grid, and renewable energy.Through GreenGov.SG, MSE will drive public sector efforts to achieve net-zero emissions around 2045, five years ahead of our national target. The Government will publish an annual GreenGov.SG report and Statutory Boards will disclose their environmental sustainability efforts, progress, and plans. The public sector will reduce its electricity and water consumption and waste generation, and further enhance its green procurement policies. Environmental stewardship means shifting away from a make-use-throw mindset, and embracing a circular economy and zero-waste culture. The Extended Producer Responsibility framework is an important enabler to encourage sustainable production upstream by requiring producers to be responsible for the collection and proper treatment of their products at end-of-life. Manufacturers and importers will need to reframe their thinking, redesign their business processes and products, and consider environmental externalities throughout the life cycle of their products.As a low-lying and densely built island nation, Singapore is vulnerable to rising sea levels and rising temperatures. To adapt to increased flood risk, we will continue to enhance the effectiveness of our drainage network, and put in place multi-functional adaptation infrastructure for Singaporeâs coastlines. To preserve liveability amidst rising temperatures, the Government will expand our urban heat mitigation measures by increasing greenery and using cool paints. We will develop solutions collaboratively through public consultations and dialogue sessions.We will increase our food resilience by diversifying our food import sources and continuing to ramp up local food production capabilities and capacity to produce 30% of our nutritional needs by 2030. This includes increasing the adoption of productive technologies and sustainable farming practices, making better use of land and sea spaces for agriculture and aquaculture, and encouraging demand for local produce.Climate change will also raise the risk of vector-borne diseases like dengue and pose challenges to public health. We will continue to safeguard Singaporeâs public health through vector control and risk surveillance. We will continue to pilot, evaluate and scale new innovative solutions, such as Project Wolbachia.We will invest in new capabilities to realise our sustainability ambitions and raise our national resilience. We have introduced or stepped-up research and development programmes in areas such as decarbonisation, agri-food production, urban heat mitigation, coastal protection, and vector control, in partnership with both local and foreign companies and Institutes of Higher Learning. We will test-bed and implement innovative technologies, such as solar panels on reservoirs, and synergistic waste-to-energy at the Tuas Nexus. These efforts will be supported and sustained by a pipeline of local talent. The Singapore Green Plan is supported by a growing movement of individuals, community groups and businesses wishing to build a more sustainable and resilient Singapore. Through Forward Singapore, the community, public, and private sectors have discussed how we can, as a society, foster a more sustainable way of life, and steward our environmental resources responsibly for future generations. For example, the Green Action for Communities movement brings together community leaders and residents to co-create and co-implement sustainability initiatives that impact their communities directly. We will also continue to support community-led environmental sustainability projects through the SG Eco Fund. Building a sustainable, resilient, and future-ready Singapore requires everyone to play a part. Our convictions must translate to tangible action. We must change our mindsets, lifestyles and habits to build a more resilient and sustainable Singapore.\n",
      "The Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran)\n",
      "Our air, sea and land transport sectors have weathered the worst of the pandemic and emerged stronger, due to the close cooperation between the Government, workers, unions, and industry partners. In the next phase, the Ministry of Transport (MOT) will focus on gearing up for growth. We will enhance the competitiveness of our global aviation and maritime hubs by strengthening capabilities and sustainability efforts, and creating opportunities for our enterprises and people. We will build a sustainable, resilient and inclusive land transport system as part of a liveable city for Singaporeans. Changi Airportâs passenger traffic has recovered to about 80% of pre-COVID levels; passenger traffic is expected to recover fully by 2024. As our anticipated activities return, the Government will work with aviation stakeholders to build up Changi Airportâs operational capacity ahead of demand, and readiness to deal with new threats. Singaporeâs maritime hub stayed resilient and performed well through the pandemic, maintaining our position as the worldâs busiest transhipment hub. We must build on our strengths to respond adroitly to changes in the global economic landscape and disruptions to supply chains. The Government has planned major expansions in our aviation and maritime infrastructure over the next two decades. We have restarted the Changi Airport Terminal 5 (T5) project, which is targeted to be operational in the mid-2030s. MOT is working with the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore and Changi Airport Group to update the design of T5 to be pandemic-resilient, with greater modularity for flexibility in scaling operations. The new terminal will also be designed for sustainability with energy-efficient features. Tuas Port opened as planned despite the pandemic and is on track to be completed by the 2040s, with an annual handling capacity of 65 million twenty-foot equivalent units.Beyond upgrading our infrastructure, MOT will strengthen capabilities in the aviation and maritime sectors through digitalisation and other innovations. To build up our aviation and maritime workforce, we are collaborating with industry partners to reach out to more students, develop work-study programmes, and support job conversions and skills upgrading for mid-career workers. We will also invest in our people by redesigning jobs and deepening skillsets.Sustainability is central to the next phase of growth for our aviation and maritime hubs. Both sectors will contribute towards the national target to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. MOT will aim for all airside vehicles at Changi Airport to run on cleaner energy by 2040, and will require all new airside light vehicles, forklifts, and tractors to be electric from 2025 as part of the transition. We will also require all new harbour craft operating in our port waters to be fully electric, capable of using B100 biofuels or compatible with net-zero fuels such as hydrogen from 2030. MOT will also work with the aviation and maritime ecosystems to put the regulatory frameworks, pilots, incentives, and infrastructure in place to facilitate a smooth transition.On the global stage, MOT actively supports the efforts of the International Civil Aviation Organization and the International Maritime Organization to reduce emissions from international transport. We also work with partners to develop sustainable international aviation and maritime ecosystems, such as \"green lanes\" for flights powered by sustainable aviation fuels as well as green and digital shipping corridors.Public transport remains at the heart of our land transport system. Many participants in our Forward Singapore engagements recognised and appreciated the improvements to our public transport system over the last decade, which have made it more accessible, reliable, and inclusive. The Government will significantly expand our land transport network over the next decade. We are on course to expand our rail network by a further 100 kilometres; when completed, eight in ten homes will be within a ten-minute walk of an MRT station. Increasing the density of our rail network will make journeys more convenient for commuters, enhance the resilience of the overall system, and contribute significantly towards our net-zero emissions target by encouraging more people to opt for public transport over private vehicles. We must also ensure fiscal sustainability, as we invest in building a high-quality, world-class public transport system. Financing public transport is a shared responsibility across the Government, operators, and commuters. We are heartened that participants in our Forward Singapore engagements acknowledged the need for this, while emphasising the importance of affordable public transport fares, especially for the vulnerable and lower-income groups. The Public Transport Council is reviewing the fare adjustment formula and mechanism, to achieve equitable cost distribution across all stakeholders. MOT will further encourage the adoption of cleaner-energy vehicles through regulation, incentives, and infrastructure. We have established clear regulatory milestones: to disallow registration of diesel cars and taxis from 2025, and Internal Combustion Engine cars and taxis from 2030. We will review financial incentives to encourage the adoption of electric cars, and monitor related developments in other vehicle segments, such as motorcycles and goods vehicles. We have brought forward the island-wide deployment of Electric Vehicle (EV) chargers, and one in three public housing carparks will have EV charging points by the end of this year, with full coverage by 2025. We remain on track to deploy 60,000 charging points by 2030.A central theme that emerged from our Forward Singapore engagements was for our transport system to be more inclusive, especially for seniors and persons with disabilities. To make our streets more conducive for pedestrians, we will expand pedestrian-friendly initiatives, such as retrofitting lifts at pedestrian overhead bridges, providing covered linkways, and traffic-calming schemes such as Silver Zones and School Zones. We will work with local stakeholders to pilot Friendly Streets in five neighbourhoods, in areas near key amenities with high pedestrian flow. Features, such as wider footpaths, more greenery, barrier-free crossings and road markings, will inform road users that they are in a Friendly Streets zone. Where necessary, we will also implement more direct crossings for pedestrians and reduce waiting times for pedestrians at traffic crossings. Friendly Streets will complement the expansion of our network of cycling paths to about 1,300 kilometres by 2030. Every town will have cycling paths by 2024; these intra-town paths will aid first and last mile connectivity to the major public transport nodes and key amenities.We will drive the next bound of growth across our air, sea and land transport sectors. Together, we will continue to build a more resilient, sustainable and inclusive transport system for all Singaporeans.\n",
      "The Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security and Minister-in-charge of the National Security Coordination Secretariat (Mr Teo Chee Hean)\n",
      "Security and resilience are critical to Singaporeâs continued survival and success. Even as we face established security threats, such as terrorism, foreign subversion and espionage, new risks are emerging, driven by trends, such as growing geopolitical contestation, climate change and accelerating digitalisation. These risks include disruptions in supply chains and resources, extreme weather events that jeopardise critical infrastructure and lives, and the rapid and widespread digital transmission of disinformation that can exploit fissures in our society. The National Security Coordination Secretariat (NSCS) works with government agencies to identify, assess, and address cross-cutting medium-term national security risks. NSCS focuses on risks where a whole-of-Government response is needed. These include growing security risks in the economic and social domains. Growing geopolitical contestation has made the global environment more uncertain and inhospitable, especially for a small country like Singapore. For example, the Russia-Ukraine conflict upended global supply chains and energy supplies, even as the world was still reeling from COVID-19 disruptions. NSCS will work with agencies to mitigate risks to the flow of essential supplies, and to strengthen our resilience against global supply disruptions. Climate change affects, among others, food, water, and energy supplies. It can also cause extreme weather events that knock out critical infrastructure and pose risk to lives. This risk is exacerbated by the interdependencies across our critical infrastructure and essential services. For example, disruptions to power can affect internet connectivity and trigger a cascading impact on services provided over the Internet. NSCS will work with government agencies to study these interdependencies and develop mitigation plans for such risks. Strengthening social resilience is critical for a diverse, multi-racial, and multi-religious country like Singapore. We must continue to strengthen our foundation of unity and trust in peace time, so that we will stay united as one Singapore in times of crisis.Accelerating digitalisation poses new and enhanced risks to our social resilience and cohesion. While digital connectivity benefits businesses and citizens, it can also make us more susceptible to foreign influence and misinformation. Opportunistic actors can leverage digital connectivity to exploit societal tensions and fault lines. NSCS will work with government agencies to develop strategies to address these risks and strengthen social resilience. As security risks become more multi-faceted and inter-linked, government agencies must build the capacity and capability to collectively address them. NSCS will support agenciesâ capability development with resources and funding, including for national security research. Singapore must remain vigilant and proactive in tackling traditional and emerging risks to our security and resilience. NSCS will continue to work closely with other Ministries to maintain a coherent and co-ordinated Whole-of-Government approach to protect Singapore and Singaporeans.\n",
      "The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai)\n",
      "The Ministry of Culture, Community and Youthâs (MCCY) mission is to build a caring, cohesive and confident nation, where everyone feels they belong and is inspired to work towards a common future. Through the Forward Singapore exercise, Singaporeans came up with ideas to strengthen our solidarity and mutual responsibility as one united people. MCCY will partner Singaporeans to act on these ideas to build a better and stronger Singapore for all and generations to come.MCCY will continue to develop our arts, heritage, and sports facilities and programmes as common spaces for people to come together to build shared memories. The Peranakan Museum and Childrenâs Museum recently opened with refreshed and interactive exhibits that tell the Singapore story. Our festivals, such as the Singapore International Festival of Arts, Singapore Art Week, and Singapore Heritage Festival, bring Singaporeans together to celebrate our arts achievements and heritage. Singaporeans will enjoy greater access to world-class sports facilities and marquee sports, lifestyle and entertainment events with the Government taking over ownership of the Sports Hub and rejuvenating the Kallang Alive precinct. MCCY is committed to growing a vibrant arts, heritage, and sports sector, that reinforces our shared identity as Singaporeans, instils national pride and confidence in our achievements and people, and fosters an inclusive society where individualsâ skills and talent, especially in the arts and sports domains, are valued. We are unlocking new opportunities with the next iteration of Our SG Arts Plan and Our SG Heritage Plan. We are also updating the Disability Sports Master Plan to set out pathways for aspiring para-athletes, and to enable persons of different abilities to participate in sport. MCCY will continue to support artists and athletes, including through new and enhanced facilities, greater support for self-employed practitioners to grow and innovate, and uplifting sector capabilities. We must continue to build a deep reserve of social capital and trust and nurture the âgotong royongâ spirit. MCCY will continue to facilitate opportunities for Singaporeans to donate or volunteer for causes they are passionate about, through platforms such as Youth Corps Singapore, Team Nila, and our network of SG Cares Volunteer Centres across 24 towns. Through partners like the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre (NVPC), Community Foundation of Singapore, and Singapore Kindness Movement, we will promote care for each other as an integral part of Singapore culture and everyday life. The Peopleâs Association will increase opportunities for citizens to be involved in community service and improvement projects in their local neighbourhoods.Schools remain an important common space to develop cross-cultural understanding and friendships from an early age. Programmes, such as Strategic Partnership Co-Curricular Activities, allow students from different schools to participate in activities, such as athletics, water polo and ethnic dance. We are also topping up the accounts of ActiveSG members aged four to 12 years with an additional $100 of ActiveSG credits, so children can interact and bond outside of school. Across ages, our arts and sports programmes, such as the Childrenâs Season, Childrenâs Biennale, and Active Parents, encourage family bonding, while our Active Silver Hubs promote intergenerational bonding and help seniors stay active.Demographic and societal shifts require us to continually reforge the bonds of trust among our diverse communities. Together with community partners, such as our Self-Help Groups, MCCY will facilitate mutual support across ethnic communities to ensure that the fruits of growth and progress are shared by all. We have refreshed existing platforms such as our Racial and Religious Harmony Circles so that they remain relevant in fostering social harmony and enhanced the Community Dispute Management Framework to promote pro-social behaviour and good neighbourliness.MCCY will continue to build a resilient society where the Government and other stakeholders, including businesses, communities and individual Singaporeans, tackle challenges together. Businesses have a role to play in strengthening our social fabric. MCCY is supporting the NVPC and the Singapore Business Federation to grow the number of businesses that generate value for society at large. MCCY is also extending and enhancing the Corporate Volunteer Scheme (previously known as the Business and IPC Partnership Scheme) so businesses can continue to enjoy tax deductions when their employees volunteer at an Institution of a Public Character. Businesses can also contribute through mentoring. The Mentoring SG office has been set up to grow awareness of mentoring, match individuals and organisations to suitable mentoring opportunities, and build capabilities to grow the mentoring movement at the national level. Corporate bodies can step up to provide volunteer mentors or opportunities for their employees to be mentored.Every individual contributes to society in their roles as family member, citizen and worker. We encourage all Singaporeans to partner the Government in refreshing our social compact through the Forward Singapore exercise. In our engagements, many Singaporeans were enthusiastic about playing a bigger role in shaping our future, including by contributing ideas, shaping policy and participating in new forms of engagement and partnership. They also agreed that closer collaboration and partnership between the Government and other stakeholders in society was essential in the next phase of nation-building. MCCY, together with the rest of the Government, will offer opportunities for Singaporeans to co-develop policies and solutions on salient national-level issues through platforms, such as Citizensâ Panels and Alliances for Action (AfAs). At least 35 AfAs have been formed since 2019. We see healthy, sustained youth interest in policy making. MCCY will encourage more youths to engage in constructive civic discourse, take action to make change, and contribute to policy co-creation through platforms such as the Youth Circles and programmes such as the Youth Action Challenge. Somerset Belt will be a refreshed and vibrant precinct for youths, with youths, and by youths. Young people can lend their voices to shape Somerset Belt into a space to experiment in and call their own. We will continue to create new platforms to give our youth opportunities to shape Singapore.Through the Forward Singapore engagements, Singaporeans have shared that they care about deepening inclusiveness, promoting fairness and growing a culture of giving back. MCCY will rally and support Singaporeans in achieving these ideals and aspirations, to build a stronger and better society.\n",
      "The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lawrence Wong)\n",
      "The Ministry of Finance (MOF) seeks to advance the well-being and development of Singapore through sustainable and forward-looking fiscal policies. We aim to enable an innovative, resilient and efficient Government that delivers strong outcomes and value for money for Singaporeans. MOF will work with Government agencies to deploy resources in support of our national priorities, including initiatives being developed in the Forward Singapore exercise.We will allocate our resources in a prudent and responsible manner and continue to adjust our fiscal strategies to support the aspirations of present and future generations of Singaporeans. We will continue to steward our reserves as a crisis fund and an endowment fund, to take care of present and future generations. We will also continue to ensure good governance and accountability in the use of public funds.Our fiscal space is now tighter than before. Looking to the medium-term, we expect annual Government spending to increase to around 19% â 20% of GDP in Financial Year (FY)2026 â FY2030, and possibly exceed 20% of GDP by FY2030. The key drivers of growing expenditure are healthcare and social spending, such as moves to uplift lower-wage workers and strengthen early childhood education. To close the funding gap, MOF has taken steps to strengthen our revenue position at Budget 2022 and Budget 2023, so that rising Government spending can be balanced by total revenue in the coming years. We have also enhanced the progressivity of our system of taxes and transfers. Beyond what we have factored into our projections, the Government may need to spend more, for example, to enhance Singaporeâs economic competitiveness, social inclusion and mobility, or national resilience. If this were to happen, we would require more revenue, or a reallocation of existing funds to the new priority areas. MOF will continue to ensure sound and stable public finances for Singapore, through a sustainable mix of taxes on income, consumption and assets. We will uphold a fiscal system that is fair and progressive, where everyone contributes, but those who are better off will contribute more; where everyone benefits from Government spending, and those with greater needs will benefit more. MOF will also ensure that public sector manpower grows in a disciplined manner, to avoid taking up an out-sized share of the resident labour force at the expense of the private sector. As our resident labour force growth continues to slow, MOF will put in place additional measures to manage and reallocate limited manpower resources to meet future needs. MOF will continue with efforts to ensure good governance and enable a high-performing Government, to meet the needs and expectations of Singaporeans. MOF will work closely with Government agencies to ensure the effectiveness of Government spending. Our Government procurement will continue to be open and competitive, to achieve value-for-money and cost-effective outcomes. We will work with businesses, especially small-medium enterprises, to improve access to procurement opportunities, and to ensure a healthy pipeline of suppliers that are competitive, innovative and capable of meeting our future needs. MOF will work with Ministries to implement structured frameworks for programme evaluation and strengthen evaluation capabilities in support of better decision-making and resource allocation. This will be accompanied by efforts in enterprise risk management and internal audit to strengthen our system of governance. MOF will continue to publish the Singapore Public Sector Outcomes Review biennially.MOF will press on with digital transformation efforts. This includes integrating budgeting, procurement and payment systems for better whole-of-Government financial management. We will step up the use of data analytics to monitor resource utilisation, track spending outcomes and shape policy development. Digitalisation will also simplify Government processes and lower costs for businesses when they transact with the Government. Examples include the adoption of e-guarantees to replace paper guarantees, and direct e-invoice submissions through InvoiceNow to eliminate the need for manual processing.MOF will support public sector manpower capability development, by raising competencies in finance, procurement, internal audit, grants governance and the deployment of shared services. MOF will harness our fiscal resources prudently and responsibly, working closely with Government agencies and partners from the industry and community, so that we can move forward together with confidence and strength.\n",
      "The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam)\n",
      "Amidst intensifying geopolitical tensions and increased economic uncertainty, Singapore must maintain a high level of trust in our Rule of Law and our legal institutions. The Ministry of Law (MinLaw) will work closely with our partners, stakeholders and the public to strengthen our legal system, enhance access to justice, optimise the use of our limited land resources and support Singaporeâs economic development. A strong Rule of Law is a fundamental pillar of a trusted government. We will press on with efforts to enhance trust and relevance, and improve accessibility of our legal system. We will proactively steward legal reforms to meet evolving societal needs, while ensuring that our processes are up-to-date, efficient, and effective, such as by becoming a Party to the Hague Service Convention, which can help Singapore litigants with the effective service abroad of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil and commercial matters. We will also uphold multilateralism and a rules-based international order by deepening engagements with international organisations. Singapore recently joined the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law, a leading intergovernmental organisation that develops international treaties and standards in commercial law.We passed the Courts (Civil and Criminal Justice) Reform Act 2021, which empowered the Courts to conduct remote, asynchronous and paper hearings in a flexible manner. This reduced the costs of litigation and improved convenience for Court users. In the area of family justice, we are working with key partners, such as the Ministry of Social and Family Development and the Family Justice Courts, to make family legal proceedings simpler and more efficient. These efforts aim to reduce acrimony in family proceedings, promote healing in family relationships, and safeguard the welfare of children. The establishment of the Public Defenderâs Office (PDO) in end-2022, together with the expansion of coverage for criminal defence aid to the bottom 35% of households and covering most offences, was a significant milestone in our legal landscape. More Singaporeans and Permanent Residents can now have access to criminal defence aid. The decision to establish the PDO, which institutionalises public defence within the criminal justice system, was done after extensive consultations with the Law Society of Singapore and the Criminal Bar. We will continue to improve access to justice and legal services for all Singaporeans. We are working with the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth and the Ministry of National Development to enhance the Community Dispute Management Framework. We will be mandating mediation for certain types of disputes between neighbours and enhancing the effectiveness of proceedings in the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals. We will also continue to partner key stakeholders like Pro Bono SG on initiatives to improve access to justice, such as the set-up of a one-stop portal, for the public to access legal information. Singapore must continue to remain open to the world and find new ways to stay relevant and maintain trust. We are working with the Law Society of Singapore to explore industry-wide secondment and exchange programmes to provide our law practices and lawyers with opportunities to gain experience and expertise in growth domains and in key markets. To prepare our legal workforce for the future, the Steering Committee on the Reform of Legal Education and Training is reviewing the legal education and training required to develop our legal manpower. This will ensure that law students and lawyers continue to be well-equipped with the knowledge and skills they need for practice in the future economy. We will continue to strengthen Singaporeâs position as a hub for legal and dispute resolution services, and harness the growth of the legal services sector across the world. We will build on our dispute resolution ecosystem and encourage foreign dispute resolution institutions to broaden and deepen their presence in Singapore. We will continue to establish and deepen relations with markets of interest, to capture opportunities for our Singapore institutions, law practices and lawyers. We will also build on the Singapore Convention Week and United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Academy to increase our mindshare and build connections to Singapore.We will also continue to build a forward-looking IP hub that creates value for the economy and provides good jobs for Singaporeans. To ensure that our IP regime remains relevant and continues to support innovative and creative enterprises, we have updated relevant IP legislation, such as the Copyright Act 2021 and the IP (Amendment) Act 2022. To support the development and use of Intangible Assets (IA) to create economic and business value, we will introduce the Intangibles Disclosure Framework to provide a consistent basis for businesses to disclose and communicate details of their intangibles and set up an enterprise-centric online platform to provide companies with better access to professional IA/IP services. We will continue to support law firms and lawyersâ efforts to leverage technology to improve the delivery of their services and better meet their stakeholdersâ needs. We will further enhance the Legal Technology Platform to integrate it with public systems like eLitigation, LawNet, ACRA, and Sign with Singpass, and bring greater seamlessness to a lawyerâs day-to-day workflow.We will continue to maximise the potential and unlock the value of state properties, to meet Singaporeâs social and economic objectives. We will pursue partnerships with stakeholders, experts and the public, such as the rejuvenation of Gillman Barracks, Yarrow Gardens, and Dempsey, to harness innovative ideas and business models and realise the potential value of our limited land and space.The Singapore Land Authority is developing the Digital Conveyancing Portal (DCP), following engagements with multiple stakeholders, including the Housing and Development Board, Urban Redevelopment Authority and other stakeholders involved in the conveyancing process, like real estate developers, conveyancing lawyers and law clerks. It aims to transform the current paper-based conveyancing process into a fully integrated and paperless one. We will continue engaging stakeholders and taking in feedback across the development phases to co-deliver a DCP that best meets the needs of the public and industry.MinLaw has been strengthening our legal system, developing our legal industry and improving access to justice. We will continue to engage our key stakeholders, strengthen the partnerships and trust built up over the years, and ensure that our policies remain relevant, to better realise our vision of \"A Trusted Legal System; A Trusted Singapore\".\n",
      "The Minister for Education and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service (Mr Chan Chun Sing)\n",
      "The Public Service Division is committed to advancing a Public Service that can always be trusted to deliver excellent service and a better future for Singapore, by building future-ready organisations, new and more agile capabilities, and a strong and diverse leadership with development opportunities for all our officers. We are reorganising our service delivery across different service delivery platforms, including physical centres, call centres and digital platforms, around citizens rather than only around agencies. We are also streamlining and redesigning regulatory processes to make it easier for businesses. We are organising information on GoBusiness so enterprises can access services and resources in an integrated and business-centred way. For example, first-time prospective business owners can now register their business through a step-by-step guided journey on the GoBusiness platform. In a fast-changing environment, the Public Service needs to develop a workforce that can learn, unlearn and relearn, so as to continue serving Singapore better. We are shifting our HR system so that it is anchored on competencies and skills, with more emphasis placed on competency development for officers, and with the use of competencies to guide how we recruit, reward and recognise officers. We are also instilling a mindset of continuous growth among public officers, to support their longer-term employability and contribution. We are concurrently helping officers build new skills and experiences throughout their careers, through training and development opportunities that take the form of structured job rotations, attachments to the private sector, cross-agency projects and short-term immersions with other Government agencies. This will ensure skills diversity and more career mobility for all public officers. The Public Service will also need to build capabilities in science, technology and engineering. The Public Service is reorganising itself to leverage Science and Technology (S&T) advancements to overcome manpower, fiscal, land and carbon constraints. The Science and Technology Policy and Plans Office coordinates the development of S&T capabilities across the Government in areas like robotics and automation, modelling and simulation, and low-carbon and sustainability solutions, with experts residing in Centres of Excellence that support technology adoption and demand aggregation in these areas across the Public Service. For example, the Land Transport Authority supports the public sectorâs shift to clean energy vehicles; the Urban Redevelopment Authority supports urban operations and service delivery through urban modelling and simulation platforms.Strong leadership is critical to the Public Serviceâs effectiveness in an increasingly complex environment. We will continue to invest in developing our pipeline of leaders, ensuring that there is diversity of skills and experiences. We are diversifying our selection and sourcing process for scholarship holders and direct recruits, beyond traditional talent pools. We are also transforming our leadership development approaches to better prepare in-service leaders to lead their teams and organisations. These initiatives, which include the introduction of leadership competencies, 360-degree feedback exercises, job rotations and a stronger mentoring culture, are being extended to more leaders in the Public Service, including professional and specialist leaders and middle managers. Even as we reinvent, reorganise and reskill the Public Service to serve our people and nation better, the values and ethos of the Public Service must remain. The Public Service will continue to reinforce the sense of purpose in our officers and leaders, and maintain the trust of Singaporeans.\n",
      "The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Smart Nation and Cybersecurity (Mrs Josephine Teo)\n",
      "The Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG) aims to harness technology to secure opportunities for all, build trust and safety, and foster an inclusive Singapore community. We work closely with other Government agencies to ensure technology bolsters Singaporeâs resilience and improves the lives of Singaporeans. Digital technology offers significant opportunities for businesses, people and Government agencies. SNDGG will enable all to seize these benefits through close partnerships with Government agencies, industries and research players, and with robust digital and cyber-physical infrastructure anchored by a strong Digital Government. First, SNDGG will leverage technology to facilitate the business activity, growth and innovation of Singapore-based enterprises. Together with the Ministry of Trade and Industry, we will enhance the one-stop GoBusiness digital platform to support firmsâ day-to-day transactions and longer-term investments, such as in equipping workers with future skills. We will work with the Ministry of Communications and Information to support the digital economy through initiatives like the SG Financial Data Exchange. We will make it easier for businesses to tap on the expertise of public research players for innovation, such as through the JTC-Singapore Institute of Technology Living Lab testbed, and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)-Smart Nation and Digital Government Office Jurong Lake District Innovation Challenge.  Second, SNDGG will use technology to transform the lived experiences of citizens. We will improve the convenience of digital services and transactions through applications, such as Singpass and LifeSG. We will also drive advancements in Singaporeâs cyber-physical infrastructure with URA, including scaling innovative solutions in estate management from Punggol Smart Town to other districts. Finally, SNDGG will refresh the Digital Government Blueprint in end-2023 and strive towards more discoverable, personalised and seamless Government services. We will work closely with ServiceSG to redesign whole-of-Government service delivery. This includes promoting the use of common digital platforms across Government and building up the Governmentâs data sharing and data usage architecture.  As more of our lives and Government services move to the digital space, it is essential to maintain trust in public institutions and secure the digital platforms hosting these services, so people feel safe and protected against scams. This will set Singapore apart from other world-leading digital hubs. First, SNDGG will roll out the CheckWho product in end-2023 to help the public verify the legitimacy of calls from public officers. Second, SNDGG will ensure that transactions on Government platforms are secure and resilient with tools to better detect phishing sites that pose as Government agency websites, and fraud analytics solutions for Singpass. We will also continue to move more eligible Government systems to Cloud to improve resilience, security monitoring and threat detection.  Finally, SNDGG will work with the community to bolster digital trust and safety. We will support the National Crime Prevention Council and the Singapore Police Force to foster a culture of vigilance and contribution to scam prevention through applications like ScamShield.  Even as SNDGG aims to enable Singaporeans to reap economic benefits and productivity gains in the digital age, our fundamental aspiration is to build an inclusive, united and caring society that is âDigital First but not Digital-Only\". Together with ServiceSG, SNDGG will ensure that citizen services offered by public agencies remain accessible for less digitally adept Singaporeans, such as seniors and people with disabilities. Non-digital touchpoints and assistance will be made available to these groups of Singaporeans, wherever possible and necessary. SNDGG will also empower our people to use digital tools to participate fully in society. We will support efforts by MCI to promote digital skills and literacy in our people, such as the Digital for Life movement led by the Infocomm Media Development Authority, which galvanises the community to help citizens of all ages and from all walks of life embrace lifelong digital learning.  Digital technologies will empower Singapore to discover new opportunities and make our mark on the world. With our people, private and public sector partners, SNDGG is committed to building a Smart Nation where everyone has a place.\n",
      "The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister-in-charge of Strategy Group (Mr Lawrence Wong)\n",
      "The Strategy Group will continue to lead the Public Service to develop and implement strategic priorities, tackle long-term national challenges and build a better Singapore for all. We see fraying social compacts in many countries around the world, where people feel excluded from their nationâs progress and cannot find a common way forward on important national issues. This is why we are embarking on the Forward Singapore exercise â to bring Singaporeans together to examine our shared values and responsibilities towards one another, and to refresh our social compact. During our engagements, many shared their desire to build a fairer, more inclusive and more caring society. The Strategy Group will work with Government agencies to refresh our strategies and develop new policy responses, so that Singaporeans will have opportunities to progress throughout life, stronger assurances to tide over difficult times and a renewed sense of solidarity for the future. Beyond Forward Singapore, the Strategy Group will continue to strengthen whole-of-Government planning and execution to effectively tackle increasingly complex and cross-cutting challenges. These include a fragmented global order amid rising geopolitical tensions, new challenges brought about by technology, and the ongoing need to help Singaporeans cope with greater disruption and change. In response to this rapidly changing environment, the Strategy Group will review and refresh Singaporeâs medium- to long-term national priorities, and work with Government agencies to strengthen the resilience of our economy, society and nation. Amidst growing resource constraints, we will also support agencies by centrally developing capabilities and coordinating structures across the Public Service. We will organise cross-agency work on policy development and implementation, to better manage trade-offs and achieve our desired outcomes across both economic and social domains. Like other advanced economies, Singapore faces a declining total fertility rate and an ageing population. Our local workforce growth will continue to slow. Caregiving needs will intensify as family sizes shrink and more Singaporeans face dual pressures of raising young children while caring for their elderly parents. Our society is also becoming more diverse and our multicultural identify will continue to evolve. We will update our population strategies to tackle these challenges. First, we will do more to harness longevity as a strength, so that individuals can reap the benefits of longer and healthier lives. Second, the Government will continue to carefully manage our foreign worker and immigration flows, to ensure that these translate to tangible benefits for Singaporeans, and to help newcomers integrate better into our society. Third, we will strengthen efforts to build a society where families matter and are well supported.We will do more to support the marriage and parenthood aspirations of Singaporeans. The Government has announced a package of pro-family measures at Budget 2023. The Strategy Group will continue to review and update our policies, including ways to extend more help to parents caring for their infants, and to those seeking to better manage their work and family commitments.Beyond Government measures, the whole of society has to come together to develop an environment that supports families and values family well-being. The Government will continue to work with the community, employers and other stakeholders to build a Singapore Made For Families.Amid the rising urgency to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, we will push ahead with efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change. All stakeholders must work together as we transition to a more resilient and sustainable society.Last year, Singapore raised our national climate target â to reduce our emissions to around 60 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030, after peaking our emissions earlier, and to get to net-zero emissions by 2050. To achieve these targets, the Government plans to raise the carbon tax to a range of $50 to $80 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030. We will diversify our energy mix with greener alternatives, such as hydrogen and regional renewable energy. We will work with industry and other stakeholders to research, develop and deploy low-carbon climate technologies, such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage. We will build a pipeline of high-quality carbon credit projects to help meet our climate goals. We will also support Singaporeâs industries to embrace green opportunities and develop a workforce ready for the green economy of the future.At the same time, we must be prepared for the worst. The Strategy Group is concurrently working with Government agencies to prepare Singapore for the effects of global warming, such as rising sea levels and temperatures, and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events. The Government will also continue to participate actively at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and other international platforms to help shape the global climate regime, build partnerships and share expertise and climate solutions with the international community.The Governmentâs ability to think ahead and plan for the long term is key in ensuring Singaporeâs continued survival and success. We will continue to strengthen forward planning capabilities across the Government. We will work with Singaporeans to achieve a better Singapore that will endure and thrive for generations to come.\n"

      "Mr Chairman, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head M of the Estimates be reduced by $100\". Sir, let me start by commending the Ministry of Finance (MOF) for publishing the Occasional Paper on the Medium-Term Fiscal projections; and releasing it just before the Budget debate. This paper provides a useful forward view on the likely fiscal trends in the next decade, as we debate Budget 2023 and our longer-term positioning in the new era.It is clear from the Paper that both our operating and development expenditures are rising, and may rise sharply in the years ahead. We look set to be heading towards a recurring spending bill of about 20% of our GDP by 2030. The key drivers are expected: healthcare, wage subsidies, security and other social spending.We know that these spending, once introduced, can only grow bigger and are unlikely to be reversed. Cutting costs to balance a Budget is increasingly not a possible option. We need to expand and diversify our revenue sources, and hence, growing our economy and growing our reserves for the annuities to help fund the Budget is an imperative. While we cannot cut costs to greatness, we should do our level best to ensure public funds are well spent, spend effectively and are achieving the desired outcomes.Given this backdrop, I would like to hear from the Minister, how MOF intends to maintain fiscal sustainability, even as our spending needs continue grow? Sir, as our fiscal situation tightened up, it is even more important that MOF scrutinise and ensure that our spending is value-for-money, that cost avoidance procurement practices are adopted, and that we closely monitor and track the outcomes and key performance indexes (KPIs).In the Budget Statement debate, I expressed concerns about cost pressures faced by businesses and the need to step-up the overall productivity. Many companies transact and do businesses with the Government and the way the Government agencies conduct its operations, and the processes involved, can have a significant impact on cost to the businesses.While we must be digitally inclusive when dealing with individuals; especially the seniors, we can aim for greater digital pervasiveness when doing businesses with the enterprises. There must be continued obsession to improve processes and users' experience; whether through greater digital adoptions or process streamlining.In this regard, I would like to ask if MOF has any plans to make doing businesses with Government even more seamless, less time consuming and lower the costs? The Government is a major buyer of goods and services, and many SMEs and start-ups have innovative solutions and product offerings that can be of value to the Government. So, I would like to also ask, how can MOF and the public agencies better support and facilitate the growth of SMEs when they participate in Government procurements?Sir, Singapore is transiting to a low-carbon economy and the public sector has set itself a net-zero emissions target by around 2045. This is a laudable effort and a major undertaking for the Government. Can I ask the Ministry: how is MOF supporting the whole-of-Government in this effort?The Government and MOF can also play a significant role helping businesses build green capabilities and capture growth opportunities, given the buying power of the public sector. So, can I seek an update from Minister in this area?Sir, one other area that I hope that the Government can facilitate to do more is the development of the social sector. The Government can be a catalyst to spur more innovative social solutions and contribute to a stronger social compact. So may I ask the Minister: how is MOF is supporting the development of the social sector?And finally, in this Committee of Supply (COS), can I also seek an update on the various policy measures in place, to encourage philanthropy and volunteerism?Sir, as I have two more minutes, I just want to add my views to the discussion on the budgetary stance for Budget 2023. Earlier in the debate, Assoc Prof Jamus Lim commented that the fiscal stance for Budget 2023 is a contractionary one. I have a different view. The fact that we have a significant Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) contribution to our Budget every year, currently at 20% of our revenue, would mean that our Budget would necessarily be expansionary. Our expenditures are way higher than the taxes that we collect from the system. Hence, from that angle, our Budget will always be expansionary if we rely on NIRC to balance our books.Question proposed.Mr Chairman: Mr Leong Mun Wai, you can take your two cuts together please.\n",

      "Mr Chairman, I have questions for the Minister of Finance. Firstly, the termination payment for the Sports Hub was advanced from the Contingencies Fund and this House is now being asked to vote on replacing the amount in a Supplementary Supply Bill, how much is this termination payment? The Contingencies Fund was created for urgent and unforeseen expenditure. Was the termination payment for the Sports Hub so urgent, that it had to be advanced from the Contingencies Fund and not paid out of the Budget 2023?Secondly, where and when were the $900 million for SPH Media Trust be accounted for?Three, are there financial projections available, to determine the amount or transfer to the endowment and trust funds, and is the actual spending from the funds included in the Budget, in the year when the spending was made or is it off-balance sheet of the Budget?Fourth, when will the financial report on the $72 billion COVID-19 expenditure be completed?Fifth, based on what is given in the Budget, can the Minister confirm, what are the total financial assets as of 31 March 2022 and what is the net investment return (NIR) estimated for fiscal year 2023?Mr Chairman, the People's Action Party (PAP) Government and some of its MPs like to invoke the claim of raiding of the reserves to attack alternative policy ideas and proposals put up by the Opposition. In order to have a more productive debate in this House, it will be helpful to have an understanding of what constitutes \"raiding of reserves\". I would like to suggest two criteria to assess any new proposal that might affect the reserves.Firstly, the amount of expenditure required for the new proposal, relative to the size of the reserves and NIR. And secondly, the purpose of the expenditure, any proposal that passes these two criteria, where the amount involved is small relative to the reserves, or even the NIR, and serves an important purpose, should not be accused of raiding the reserves.Let me illustrate the two criteria using the Affordable Homes Scheme, which the Progress Singapore Party (PSP) recommended during the recent public housing Motion on 7 February 2023. During the debate, I explained that the Affordable Homes Scheme will only defer the accumulation of reserves, because the deferred land cost will be collected when the flat is sold in the future.And even if, the whole deferred land cost of about $3 billion per year is not collectable, it is only 6.4% of NIR and 12.8% of NIRC. We do not even need to use our reserves, so we have passed criteria one comfortably.For criteria two, the money is to be spent on an important and noble purpose, which is to make the Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat affordable and accessible for every Singaporean, of each generation. It will allow Singaporeans to retire comfortably, without having to sell his flat or downgrade. The financial security accorded is expected to unleash the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit in Singaporeans, and you would be able to better compete with the rest of the world. So, we also passed criteria two.Hence, based on the two criteria above, the affordable home scheme is an example of an alternative policy that does not constitute a raiding of reserves according to my definition. I hope to hear from the Minister what does she think. In the future, from my point of view, if the Government makes such accusations again, I will call them baseless allegations. Singaporeans deserve better for country, for people.\n",

      "Mr Chairman, my cut today refers to my exchange with Minister Indranee Rajah during the debate on the Carbon Pricing (Amendment) Bill.In the exchange, I was told the Presidential approval had not been obtained on my proposed amendments. I asked the Government when these amendments had been referred to the President to obtain the decision to which Minister Indranee Rajah made this reply and I am quoting a little from the longest speech she made in the interest of time, \"We determine that my amendments could not be supported, the reasons explained earlier by my colleagues and, as the amendments could not be supported, they will not put forward to the President for the President's recommendation.\"From this, it would seem that the exercise of the President's power to approve legislation that has fiscal implications has to be according to the Cabinet's advice. It would also seem that the Government can and does deem the President's approval to have been given or not given without necessarily referring the matter to the President.As I understand the statement, she did say that the President's approval or non-approval could be, to all practical intents and purposes, deemed to have been given by the Cabinet. And it did say that that particular matter had not been referred to the President.So, my questions here are two-fold.Firstly, in cases where the President has a constitutional duty to say \"yes\" or \"no\" to certain matters such as legislation with fiscal implications and when her decision can be deemed to have been given one way or the other by the Cabinet, is the matter referred to the President, the CPA and the other staff in the office of the President for at least discussion or information prior to the Cabinet's decision?And secondly, and much more importantly, what is the rationale for having such provisions in the Constitution whereby the Cabinet can deem the President to have said \"yes\" or \"no\" on certain matters and, hence, decide by itself?The role of the President in this regard does not seem to serve any check or balance function. What function then does it serve?One asks oneself what possible purpose could be served by such a procedural requirement baked into the Constitution. I can see no benefit to the body politic. In fact, I see a downside.Making it known that the President's approval is deemed by the Cabinet in certain domains as happened in November last year does not serve to enhance the prestige and standing of the Office of the President in the eyes of the public.In fact, to the contrary, this practice of \"deemed approval\" risks being seen by the public as involving the Office of President in a rubber-stamping or box-ticking exercise. It serves no constructive purpose and undermines the standing of the President. If there is no real reason for such provisions, will the Government do away with these provisions at some point in the future, given that there are no upsides but only downsides? Unless there are some upsides I cannot fathom right now and which the Government can explain.The Chairman: Mr Saktiandi Supaat, you can take both your cuts together.\n",

      "Mr Chairman, our success in weathering the recent COVID-19 pandemic came down largely to our ability to utilise our deep financial reserves, which have been accumulated by the Government who has spent public monies responsibly and prudently. In refining our checks on public spending, we must be cautious not to add further unnecessary or disproportionate bureaucracy as this will erode whatever savings we achieve from public procurement. For example, while I agree there is still room to invest in automated systems and training to eliminate human error, adding another one to two levels of approving authorities may be an inefficient and even ineffective solution.Whether under Emergency Procurement or normal procurement procedures, how does Ministry of Finance (MOF) ensure that public spending is scrutinised adequately to enable cost savings and what efforts are being undertaken to ensure prudent spending at all levels across the Government? How are larger projects, for example, like infrastructure spending being monitored?Mr Chairman, the public sector is a major buyer of goods and services. Set up in June 2000, GeBIZ was ahead of its time and was followed by many other e-procurement systems in other countries aimed at enhancing transparent competition and lowering the barriers for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to pitch for valuable Government contracts.  We should not rest on our laurels. How can GeBIZ be further augmented to help businesses save time and money in their transactions with Government agencies? For example, we can explore adding new features to integrate any industry briefings, tender briefings or site show-rounds with the relevant tender opportunities; and to engage with the procurement agency regarding any tender clarifications. Besides ensuring that the public sector obtains the best value-for-money, public procurement can serve the role of supporting the growth of promising SMEs and startups who have innovative solutions. In line with our strategy of supply diversification for resilience, can MOFâs \"value-for-money\" metric accommodate this aim? And what else can MOF doâ¯to help support the growth of promising SMEsâ¯through Government procurement?\n",

      "Mr Chairman, Sir, SMEs make up 99% of all businesses in Singapore's economy, employing nearly seven out of 10 workers and contributing close to half of our GDP. We should look for ways to further grow SMEs to large local enterprises (LLEs) to increase their scale and per capita contribution to our economy.Accordingly, I call upon MOF to facilitate more procurement opportunities for SMEs. What can MOF do to help support the growth of promising SMEs through Government procurements? In 2021, more than 80% of the procurement opportunities were open to SMEs. How can we further ensure that more such opportunities are made available for SMEs?Currently, a gap exists in contract value threshold for a request for quotations and tender. Also, can the Government review financial grading requirements for certain types of products and services to crowd source more innovative solutions? Some of these solutions can be provided by startups who may not meet the required financial grading due to the stage of their companies' growth. By doing so, the Government can tap on new innovations.An âin-betweenâ or middle ground can exist, where there is a âtender-lite systemâ which can provide SMEs and startups procure opportunities more readily. Tenders do take significant time and resources for SMEs and startups which translates to opportunity costs.In relation to the point on opportunity costs, can the Government streamline its processes to help businesses save time and money in their transactions with Government agencies? Can these digital solutions and innovations in turn encourage more efficient ways of doing business between companies and their suppliers and customers?Mr Chairman, Sir, increasing access to public sector contracts and reducing cost and time to transact with Government at the tender and operational stages can significantly help grow our SMEs and startups.\n",

      "Sir, like many in this House, I was cheered when Singapore brought forward its Singapore's NDCs to reach net zero by 2050, and for the public sector to achieve net-zero emissions by around 2045.  This is a significant commitment and a non-trivial one to achieve, especially in the midst of an energy crisis. Many decarbonisation technologies are already ready today, but the speed of rollout depends on various other factors like infrastructure upgrades, business model and regulatory changes. EVs come to mind here. While other decarbonisation technologies, especially in hard to abate sectors of the economy, are not yet available at scale today. Until technologies like green hydrogen or CCUS become cost competitive versus carbon intensive alternatives, it will be difficult to mobilise the capital needed to scale and bring them down the cost curve over time. Governments must play their part to incentivise the flow of investment into these climate solutions, and the transition to these solutions given their cost disadvantage. By giving incentives to reduce the âgreen premiumâ, and through innovative risk sharing and financing structures, including public-private partnerships, Government can be the catalyst for a faster transition. Some governments have made bolder policy moves. The US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of August 2022 has been billed as the largest piece of federal legislation to address climate change. Investing $391 billion in provisions related to energy security and climate change, including tax incentives and a green bank. The tax credits of $3 per kg of hydrogen is particularly notable, turning the US into one of the cheapest countries in the world to produce green hydrogen.  In Singapore the Government has many fiscal and non-tax levers to drive the transition which it has used, such as carbon tax, and funding for research. Given recent developments, can the Minister provide an update on how MOF is supporting the transition to net zero?\n",

      "Chairman, we anticipate a tighter fiscal space in the coming years. There is scope for wealthy families, businesses and individuals to contribute meaningfully through philanthropy to our rising needs. Unlike a conventional system that relies heavily on taxation and redistribution, philanthropy offers the added benefit of strengthening our social compact.  The number of wealth owners and family offices in Singapore continues to grow at a healthy rate. Many of them have expressed interest to give back to society, both in Singapore and regionally. The Philanthropy Tax Incentive Scheme announced in Budget 2023 for Family Offices is another important step to facilitate philanthropy and to meet Singaporeâs ambition to be Asia's philanthropic hub.   As we encourage philanthropy to continue to grow, it is important to ask what types of philanthropy will have the greatest impact on Singapore.  Prof Rob Reich of Stanford University has argued that philanthropy has a special role in discovery and experimentation, serving as societyâs \"risk capital\" to foster innovation in important areas that deemed to carry too much risk for Government or private sector appetites.   As such, philanthropy can be catalytic and complementary to public funding â it can identify and support high-impact opportunities that are in its early stage. When the solutions are proven, philanthropists can partner with the public sector to scale them up.   It is also important to identify the most pressing areas of need where philanthropy can have the greatest impact. Take climate change as an example â it is an existential imperative, and the negative effects of climate change will also exacerbate other areas of need, such as global health and pandemics, inequality and displacement of communities.   As a recent McKinsey climate philanthropy report has noted, philanthropists possess both resources and expertise to support climate mitigation and adaptation solutions, especially in areas that may lack market support.    They can quickly deploy unrestricted funds in response to urgent problems such as natural disasters, back high-risk ventures, convene stakeholders and promote collaboration, develop and share research, and support large-scale implementation of climate solutions. So, I want to ask how can the Government foster support and public-private partnerships, both in Singapore and overseas, for such philanthropic causes, to address some of societyâs most pressing challenges and issues? In promoting philanthropy, we must also consider policies across the continuum of doing good, which is wide-ranging and can include venture philanthropy, concessionary capital and impact investing â a broad range continuum.  Many wealth owners, especially those in the next generation, are looking towards these newer and more innovative approaches, sometimes referred to as âmoon-shotâ philanthropy.   So, we must also recognise that beyond grant making, there are other ways to give back such as volunteerism and the contribution of skills and networks. As the Government develops more initiatives and policies to promote philanthropy, how can it promote more diverse ways of doing good?The Chairman: Senior Minister of State Chee Hong Tat.\n",

      "Mr Chairman, I thank Members for their questions and suggestions.Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked how the Government ensures fiscal sustainability and spend prudently within our means. Besides the audits by the Auditor-Generalâs Office and our internal auditors, MOF conducts regular reviews of Ministriesâ budgets to identify areas for improvement and ensures every Ministry uses its allocated resources efficiently and effectively.Singaporeâs overall performance has been good, with current Government expenditure being around 18% of GDP. Even as our expenditures grow further and exceed 20% of GDP by 2030, our Government expenditure as a percentage of GDP is significantly lower than most developed countries. At the same time, we are able to achieve positive economic and social outcomes for Singapore and Singaporeans.  One example is how we reduce the costs of major Government infrastructure projects by applying a stringent cost-effectiveness evaluation together with experts from the private sector and academia. In 2022, we achieved total cost avoidance of around $1 billion through this process. This $1 billion saved means we can put it to good use and meet our spending needs in other areas.The Government also looks out for other forms of savings by integrating different projects to maximise the synergies. For example, the upcoming East Coast Integrated Depot, which incorporates three MRT depots and one bus depot, saved about 44 hectares of land. This is twice the land size of Changi Airportâs Terminal 4 or equivalent to approximately 60 football fields.  Another example is VITALâs Demand Aggregation contracts for common buys such as office supplies, catering and courier services. These saved the Government more than $50 million per annum. This approach also reduces the need for agencies to call separate tenders and quotations, saving at least 100,000 man-hours a year.  Sir, Mr Liang, Mr Edward Chia, Ms Mariam Jafaar and Mr Saktiandi asked how MOF helps businesses to reduce costs and build capabilities for growth. The Government will continue to implement pro-business policies and measures and provide an environment that enables them to grow and succeed. Besides supporting businesses through our economic agencies and via a comprehensive suite of grants and incentives for innovation, productivity improvements and skills-upgrading, there are two additional areas where MOFâs work benefit our companies. First, by simplifying Government rules and processes, we enable businesses to save time and money when they transact with Government. Second, by helping businesses build capabilities to enhance their competitiveness and access new opportunities, both locally and abroad.Let me share some examples.We recently launched eGuarantee@Gov, a simple and secure digital process for businesses and individuals to provide a bankerâs guarantee or insurance bond to Government agencies. Businesses can apply for an eGuarantee from over 20 participating financial institutions online for direct submission to Government agencies within a day. With eGuarantee@Gov, there is no longer a need to visit a bank to purchase a physical copy of the guarantee or to pay for courier services to deliver it. The new arrangement is quicker, better and cheaper. We expect up to 4,000 eGuarantees to be lodged in 2023, resulting in overall savings for all stakeholders of about $500,000 per year. There is also scope in the future for eGuarantees to extend to commercial transactions between businesses and their suppliers and customers. MOF and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) will work with the financial institutions and trade association and chambers to encourage adoption of eGuarantees for such transactions. Just as the use of PayNow for digital payments has allowed businesses and individuals to enjoy lower transaction costs and time savings compared to the traditional method of using cheques, the adoption of eGuarantees can bring about benefits compared to the current method of providing physical bank guarantees.Next, MOF removed the requirement for businesses with annual turnover of less than $5 million to submit audited accounts when applying for Government Supplier Registration. This benefits about 2,400 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) annually, with estimated cost savings of around $4.5 million per year. MOF continually makes improvements to GeBIZ, the Government-wide procurement system. For instance, about 3,000 businesses can benefit from the Supplier File Repository by the end of this year. Businesses no longer need to submit the same financial statements and company profile when responding to different Government quotations and tenders. We will also consider the features that Mr Saktiandi mentioned for future improvements.Sir, another example is Inland Revenue Authority of Singaporeâs (IRAS) initiative to encourage businesses to use seamless filing software. Such software provides many productivity benefits for businesses, as they can automatically generate and file their corporate income tax computations and returns. This process takes only 15 minutes compared to the estimated eight hours required for manual preparation and submission.Moving on to the next area of how MOF supports businesses to develop capabilities for growth. We will continue to simplify our processes for suppliers, including SMEs, to participate in Government tenders while maintaining a level-playing field for all businesses and achieving value-for-money procurement outcomes. For procurement below $90,000, financial track record is not required. The terms and conditions are also simplified. For example, there is no requirement to provide security deposits. SMEs participate actively in our Government contracts and about 80% of these are awarded to SMEs annually. Winning Government contracts gives SMEs the opportunity to build up their track records, develop capabilities and capacity to tap into new growth areas. To further improve the access of SMEs to business opportunities through Government tenders, MOF will introduce a new category of tender by the end of 2023 called âTender Liteâ, which comes with fewer and simpler conditions. Tender Lite will allow more suppliers to participate in tenders with value higher than $90,000 but below $1 million and is estimated to cover over 70% of all Government tenders that are currently awarded to SMEs.MOF will work with representatives from Singapore Business Federation and the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises, as well as Government agencies on the design of Tender Lite. We believe this approach of Government and industry working together as partners will bring about win-win outcomes and allow us to move faster and innovate new solutions more effectively. My colleagues and I are keen to continue the partnership with our industry partners beyond Tender Lite and extend the collaboration to other subsequent areas of work that will benefit our businesses.Members such as Mr Derrick Goh have highlighted during the Budget debate that Government can help prepare SMEs for new requirements and opportunities in environmental sustainability. We agree. The public sector is supporting our suppliersâ efforts to adopt greener practices which are increasingly in demand by other major buyers. Over the years, the Government has incorporated environmental sustainability requirements into our procurement such as requiring information and communication technology (ICT) equipment and air conditioners to meet energy efficiency standards. Our target is to include environmental sustainability requirements and evaluation criteria into all Government procurement within the next five years, in a manner that keeps pace with industry readiness and international developments. Starting from FY2024, for tenders of construction projects and ICT projects with minimum estimated procurement value of $50 million and $10 million respectively, we will set aside up to 5% of the evaluation points for sustainability-related considerations. The Government will further engage the industry stakeholders on the details of these measures. Another capability that is increasingly sought after is sustainability reporting. Businesses that can provide good sustainability-related information can gain competitive advantage, expand into markets and potentially access cheaper funds through green financing.To drive sustainability reporting efforts for the industry, Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) and the Singapore Exchange Regulation established the Sustainability Reporting Advisory Committee in June 2022. The Committee will embark on its public consultations later this year.Businesses also need to accelerate their pace of digitalisation, a point which Mr Liang made. The Government will implement InvoiceNow as the default e-invoice submission channel for all Government vendors within the next few years. Using InvoiceNow will help businesses improve efficiency and reduce cost, by eliminating the need for manual processing and it also reduces errors. Businesses transacting on InvoiceNow can save $8 per invoice compared to the manual process. InvoiceNow also facilitates the direct transmission of invoices in a structured and standardised digital format that is accepted internationally across finance systems, and this helps businesses access overseas markets more easily. Today, about 55,000 businesses have adopted InvoiceNow, supported by 200 service providers. I encourage more businesses to come on board.Sir, Mr Liang and Ms Foo Mee Har asked how MOF will support and encourage more philanthropy and volunteerism from corporations and the community. Philanthropy and volunteerism are key elements for building a strong social compact. There is something intangible and different in how we build up the character of our society, when people go beyond what they are required to contribute under our fair and progressive tax and benefits system, where everyone contributes something and those who are better off contribute more. Many Singaporeans and also foreigners and companies who are based here, have an interest in philanthropy and are keen to help others in society. We have been strengthening our ecosystem to encourage their contributions and participation to maximise the positive impact to our local communities. This is a good way to keep our society cohesive and strengthen our solidarity as one united people. Not only through taxation and redistribution which are done through policies and laws but also through philanthropy and volunteerism which come from willing hands and loving hearts.  MOF provides funding support for many community and ground-up programmes which contribute to the development of the social sector. There are many existing efforts by agencies working with intermediaries like the Community Foundation of Singapore and ComChest, as well as beneficiaries to link up donors with suitable charitable causes. I have also met wonderful people such as those from Utama and Majurity Trust, who started initiatives to help raise donations from high net worth individuals and corporations to fund worthy social causes like caring for vulnerable seniors and providing opportunities for children from lower-income families.  The Government provides broad-based support in the form of 250% tax deductions for qualifying donations to Institutions of a Public Character (IPCs) and the Corporate Volunteer Scheme (CVS) supports volunteerism efforts by businesses in IPCs. The Government also provides matching grants to encourage charitable giving. For example, we allocated a top-up of $100 million to the Tote Boardâs Enhanced Fundraising Programme which in turn provides dollar-for-dollar matching on eligible donations received by charities.Sir, to build stronger social resilience, the Government will continue to encourage our community especially those who have done well to engage in sustained giving and volunteerism. Through such efforts, we will strengthen our social compact and build a more caring and inclusive Singapore. This will then provide the social cohesion and stability for us to pursue pro-growth policies and enlarge our economic pie, generate more opportunities and provide more resources that we can then use to invest in our collective future and support the vulnerable amongst us.In this way, we can strengthen our social compact and grow our economy at the same time. The two objectives will reinforce and support each other, allowing us to move forward while staying together. The Chairman: Minister Indranee Rajah. \n",

      "Mr Chairman, I will be responding to the cuts filed by Mr Leon Perera and Mr Leong Mun Wai. Mr Leon Perera asked about the processes for obtaining the Presidentâs recommendation to move a Bill, or amendments to a Bill tabled in Parliament. Mr Chairman, under Article 59(2) of the Constitution, Bills or amendments with financial implications cannot be introduced or moved in this House without the Presidentâs recommendation. This mechanism ensures that the Government of the day has the sole right and responsibility to initiate financial legislation and therefore financial legislation cannot proceed without the Governmentâs support.It is very important to understand in this context, that for the purposes of Article 59(2), when the President gives his or her recommendation, it is upon the advice of the Government and not at the discretion of the President.If the recommendation is provided, then it shows that the legislation or amendment has the Government's support. This is different from the other provisions of the Constitution where the President acts upon his or her discretion, for example, in relation to draws on past reserves or the appointment of certain key appointment holders.Where the requirement in Article 59(2) is triggered and the Government does not support the Bill or amendment, there is no need to seek or to advise the President not to provide the recommendation. It is sufficient to inform the House that the Bill or amendment does not have the President's recommendation in accordance with the Standing Orders. Where the Government supports the Bill or the amendment, the Government will seek the recommendation of the President and formally advise the President to provide such recommendation.This requirement for Government support before financial legislation can be passed is a standard arrangement of many Commonwealth parliamentary democracies, although the mechanisms may vary.In Singapore, it is done through the mechanism of the President's recommendation, as I have explained. In New Zealand, where a Bill or amendment \"would have more than a minor impact on the Government's fiscal aggregates if it became law\", the government may issue a \"Financial veto certificate\" to state that it does not concur with the Bill or amendment, in which event, such Bill or amendment cannot be passed. In Canada, this is done by requiring the royal recommendation, which may only be obtained by a Minister, to be conveyed to Parliament.While the mechanisms may vary from country to country, the principle underpinning them is the same. That is to say, a Bill or an amendment with financial implications cannot be passed if the government of the day does not support it, in recognition of the principle that responsibility for financial matters lies with the Government. So, earlier, when Mr Leon Perera talked about \"deeming\", there is no \"deeming\" involved. If the Government does not support the Bill or the amendment, the Government would not even need to put it to the President. But if the Government supports it, then the Government will put it to the President with the requisite advice and the recommendation would be signified in Parliament. Hence, the Council of Presidential Advisers (CPA) is also not engaged because this is not a discretionary function of the President. The President may consult the CPA for the discretionary functions.For a Government Bill falling within the scope of Article 59(2), the Minister giving notice of the introduction of the Bill must indicate whether the President's recommendation is required and when introducing the Bill at First Reading, must signify whether the recommendation has been obtained. This is provided for in Standing Order 67(1).Members may recall that a few days ago, I introduced the Supply Bill. When I introduced the Supply Bill, I signified to the Chamber that I had the President's recommendation.In the case of a private Member's Bill, the Minister for Finance has to inform the Speaker whether the President's recommendation is required under Article 59(2). If the Minister for Finance informs the Speaker that the President's recommendation is in fact required, then, before the Member can be called upon to move the Motion seeking leave to introduce this Bill under Standing Order 66(1), a Cabinet Minister must signify to Parliament whether the President's recommendation has been obtained.If no such recommendation has been obtained, the Speaker shall not allow the Motion for leave to introduce the Bill to be moved. The same procedure applies to amendments proposed to Bills. That is under Standing Order 74(3)(c). One more thing I should add, which is that if a Member intends to propose a Bill or amendments to a Bill, which make provision directly or indirectly for the list of financial matters listed in Article 59(2), he or she should inform the Ministry or Minister with oversight of the matters in the Bill or amendment as soon as possible and ideally no later than the time of filing the relevant notices with Parliament so that the relevant assessments and steps can be taken. If the Member is not sure whether the matters in the Bill or amendment are caught by the provisions of Article 59(2), then all the more so it would be advisable to inform the relevant Ministry or Minister early. That deals with Mr Perera's cut. I move on to Mr Leong Mun Wai's cuts.Sir, Mr Leong Mun Wai had a series of, I think, five questions. Mr Leong did not provide the indication of these beforehand. Normally in the gist of the Budget cuts, Members are asked to provide the gist. I also do send out a notice, generally, to ask people to provide the gist of their cuts because it will then enable us to respond in a more considered or fuller manner. With respect to the five questions which basically were given on the spot, I will give such replies as I can. If the Member has any other things, it will have to be taken up separately. Let me just run through very quickly.I think the first question was on the termination of the Sports Hub. I would say in response the reason for the termination of the Sports Hub was addressed in the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY)'s Ministerial Statement in August 2022.The reasons for the urgency and the use of the Contingency Fund was: first, the transaction was market sensitive; and second, it was an opportune time to develop the Kallang Alive precinct as the sports sector recovered from COVID-19. The termination sum will be paid in this financial year.For his second question on the SPH Media Trust, that is from the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI)'s annual budget from FY2022 to FY2026. However, no money has been disbursed as Minister Josephine Teo had said in Parliament. For his third question, disbursement figures from the Government statutory funds are in the Government Financial Statements. The disbursement figures for the funds under the Statutory Boards are included in their financial statements.For his fourth question, the audit of the full $72.3 billion will be completed by the end of FY2024. This was answered earlier this month by Senior Minister of State Chee in a response to a Parliamentary Question.For the fifth question, I think the answers there can be found in the Budget Book.Then, with regard to his last point about what is the definition of \"raiding the reserves\", Mr Chairman, it is not a term of art. Essentially, we have a framework on how the reserves are to be used. When the principal amount is taken or drawn down or when land is alienated and if it is not made good or put back, that is a draw on the reserves.It is a simple principle that we adhere to. The framework is clear. It is not necessary for me to go into a definitional argument. The reasons and the rationale of when you can have a draw on the reserves are clear. A pandemic would be a good reason â when you are facing potential catastrophe and you have to save the economy, you have to save people. That is something that is built into the current framework. The reserves can only be used with the agreement of the President.The Chairman: Mr Leong Mun Wai.\n",

      "Chairman, I thank the Minister for the reply. I have three questions. One is that given the kind of payments like the Sports Hub and also SPH Media Trust, where is a big payment to a third party, what is the procedure whereby the Parliament can come in and have oversight over such expenditure? Meaning, how far can the Government just approve the expenditure, just like that?For example, now, we have this SINGA Bill where infrastructural projects that are more than $4 billion require â when it goes through the SINGA Bill, then it comes to Parliament. But does it mean that if in the future, there is a project where we need to terminate the project and it is a $4 billion payout, the Government just makes the decision like that without Parliament scrutinising the numbers? That is one question.The second question is, to your best knowledge as the Second Minister for Finance, what is the percentage of the endowment funds that are being paid out every year â as a percentage of the outstanding assets that these endowment funds have at the moment? The third question, with regards to the raiding of reserves. Your question basically means â does it mean that as long as the Government has a set of rules, we cannot debate against that set of rules? In this case, it is a set of rules regarding reserves management and the recording of the reserves. You can always say that what you have proposed is not in line with our reserve management policies but we can still discuss about it. There is no need to say right from the beginning, that this is a raiding the reserves and it is not only one time, but many many times by many people and over the mass media and all that.The Chairman: Could we keep it concise so that others can ask their clarifications?\n",

      "I thank the Member for his clarifications. I think his first question is related to what authority does the Government have and what is the relationship with Parliament and the degree of oversight. I should start off with the first premise, which is that when the people elect the Government, it is to govern. It is to run the Government. Therefore, there are quite a large scope of things which is under the authority of the Government.The Government, obviously, has to be accountable. Hence, when the Government is accountable, it has to come back to Parliament for various things. But when it comes to Parliament, it is usually to scrutinise broad policy and not the day-to-day operational matters.So, the debate that we just had, for example, the Budget debate we call it the Budget debate but actually, people forget what it actually is. It is a Motion to ask this House to approve the Government's financial policy. You approve the financial policy, all those broad headings and the broad expenditure that is agreed to by Parliament, but the details of how that is to be spent if it is within the block budget, that is really within the Ministries' purview.But if it is thought, for example, that the Ministry has not done well in its expenditure, that can be queried in Parliament either through Parliamentary Questions, and we also have the Estimates Committee, which is a standing Parliamentary Select Committee which examines the Government's Budget and raises questions thereon. I think that is available to the Member as well. So, we have a whole series of checks and balances. You have got the Constitution, which sets the framework. The fiscal policy or financial policy is subject to Parliamentary approval and subject to debate. We have got the Estimates Committee. There is also the Public Accounts Committee. It is also subject to independent audits by the Auditor-General's Office (AGO). The Public Accounts Committee also examines the Government's accounts and the AGO's report and calls on the relevant agencies to explain particular issues or to take corrective actions.For the second question on the extent of funds paid out every year, since that is a very specific question requiring certain data, perhaps the Member can file a question on that. I do not have that offhand.The third question was, I think the Member put it this way â he said does it mean that if the Government has a set of rules, we cannot debate it because he said we can always say it is not in line. He also said that there was no need to say that it is raiding one time but all the time. Let me deal with the two separately.The first one â does it mean that we have a set of rules? The answer is yes. We do have a set of rules. Does it mean that you cannot debate the rules? No. If you want to change the reserves framework, by all means, you can debate that. You can suggest that it should be changed. But so long as the rules are in place and so long as what is proposed is not in conformance with those rules and is a draw on the reserves, then it means that it falls outside or breaches, if you like, or it is not in accordance with the rules.So, there are two things. You have a set of rules. And if you want to debate whether that should or should not be the rule, that is entirely up to that Member's prerogative. But if what you happen to be proposing does not fall within the rules, then the Government is entitled to say that it would be a draw or, put it in a slightly easier to understand form, it will be a raid on the reserves.And secondly, Mr Leong suggested that there is no need to say raiding the reserves, not one time but many, many times. The answer is that, if your proposals do actually intend to draw down the reserves not one time but many, many times, then, inevitably, it will draw the reaction that you are raiding not one time but many, many times. So, it all depends on your proposal. The Chairman: Mr Liang Eng Hwa.\n",

      "Sir, just want to come back to the question I raised in my cut which is whether the Government can do more to review our rules and procedures so that we can be more pro-business and help businesses save cost and save time.I often hear this feedback from the businesses. The pain point is always that the Government rules can be quite cumbersome and some are unnecessary and the procedures can be quite inefficient.

      "Mr Chairman, I thank Mr Liang for asking this very important question. The Government deals with quite a lot of businesses: in our capacity as regulator, when they are applying for licence, they need our permit to operate; or as a buyer, when we procure services and then they are our suppliers.In both instances, there is scope for us to continue to look for ways in which we can do better in our interactions with businesses especially smaller businesses, the SMEs, because they do not have a lot of resources. So, when we design our licensing framework, when we design our rules and procedures, we also want to make sure that they are able to comply with not too much difficulty.Sir, I want to highlight that this is not just an MOF effort. This is actually a whole-of-Government effort. And my colleagues from the other Government Ministries and agencies, have also been embarking on this initiative. One of the initiatives, Mr Liang is aware, is the Pro-Enterprise Panel under the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) where we regularly solicit feedback from businesses and from trade associations on where are some of the pain points and where are some of the areas for improvement.I recall, a few years ago, when I was with MTI, I shared an example of how we used business process, re-engineering and digital transformation to implement Go-Business licensing portal where we shortened the processing time for food-related businesses when they applied for licenses by up to 14 days and we cut down the number of forms that they need to submit. Previously, I think it was 14 altogether, more than 800 data fields. We did some consolidation and we reduced it to one form with fewer than 90 data fields, and we removed some of the duplicate licences and helped them to save on licensing fees. When you remove some of these, then they do not have to apply, do not have to pay.This is something we want to keep doing and it has to be a partnership with our businesses and our trade associations, because the Government may not know fully where are all the pain points and where are all the areas for improvement. But from the users' point of view, the businesses will know. That is why I mentioned in my speech earlier that I want to work closely with SBF and ASME, not just to improve on the tender processes by introducing Tender Lite, which is one of the ways to help businesses, but also on other pro-business initiatives.\n",

      "Thank you, Chair. The hon Member Mr Liang had suggested earlier on and, if I heard correctly, that so long as we have a positive NIRC, then the Budget must necessarily be expansionary.May I first clarify that that was indeed what he said.And, if so, since the NIRC has been consistently positive, at least since 2008, would that mean that he believes that over the past decade and a half, that we have never run a contractionary fiscal stance? And I am wondering if the Minister of Finance or anyone from the Finance Ministry is willing to corroborate this characterisation.If what the Member meant was, so long as the sum of the NIRC and revenue is less than expenditure, then it is expansionary. I actually have no quarrel with that. But since the NIRC has, in fact, been positive, this would actually mean an even greater surplus over expenditure, which would mean an even more contractionary budget, contrary to an expansionary one.The Chairman: Mr Liang.\n",

      "Thank you, Chair. I have two clarifications for Senior Minister of State Chee, not on philanthropy because the question roughly is answered, but two clarifications regarding a debate brought up here.First, Senior Minister of State spoke about Government's effort to support businesses, especially SMEs. So, how we pay them is going to be important. I would like to ask, this has been brought up in previous speeches, what is Government's plan to try and pay the businesses transacts within 14 days? Is that achievable, that request from Nominated Member of Parliament Ms Janet Ang?The second clarification is, what is the targeted adoption rate for e-invoice for transaction with Government? The Senior Minister of State spoke about that just now. I want to ask what happens if some SMEs have not put in place the necessary infrastructure?

      "Mr Chairman, the current payment term for the Government to pay our suppliers is within 30 days. And this is a standard that I would say, is comparable, if not, better than some of the other governments and even private sector companies. But we will want to work towards, where possible, to shorten the payment period. Because, as the Member correctly pointed out, this will directly benefit our SMEs in terms of cashflow.I would want to caveat that a little bit by saying that it depends really on the nature of the contract. There are some that are more straightforward â the service has been provided, the product has been delivered, everything is okay, we can try and speed it up. But there are some that may require more evaluation because it is not so straightforward, or if the amounts are much bigger and we need to be careful, with due diligence, in order to ensure value for money and prudent spending.Rather than to have sort of a blanket yes or no, we will certainly aim to work towards where we can â for simpler, more straightforward contracts, smaller amounts, we try our best to go within 14 days. But larger amounts, more complex contracts, we may need to give the agencies a bit more time so that they also can safeguard the interests of public funds.The Chairman: Mr Leon Perera.\n",

I would like to thank Minister Indranee Rajah for her reply to my cut.I just have one clarification, and I appreciate her laying out the process for seeking the President's recommendation on Bills, with fiscal implications as well as speaking about areas of exercisable discretion and so on. Those points are well taken.My clarification is just about why there is a need to have this rather curious and complicated procedure, where for these matters, something is referred to the President, but then, the Cabinet instructs the President to act in a very prescriptive way and President has to act that way and then the Bill can move forward in Parliament.It does not seem to serve any constructive purpose, in terms of time and the administrative effort and efficiency. And moreover, would the Minister give some thought to the consideration I raised? There is a potential disamenity in keeping such arrangements in place which is that of the President being seen to be a part of this sort of procedure which involves box-ticking or rubber stamping. It could be seen that way. It does not really help the standing of the Office of the President and just seems unnecessary.Will the Government consider reforming this aspect of the Constitution to sort of do away with that procedural step.

It is a polite way of coming to Parliament to say that you need the Government's support. Many of the things which have its roots in parliamentary procedure from the Westminster model come from these â you could say, these courtesies of the past. The New Zealanders, as I described, are a little bit more direct about it. It is just a government \"veto certificate\". \"Nope\" and that is it. But we are doing it in a polite way. We signify whether the President has given her recommendation. Whether or not the President gives her recommendation, would depend on whether or not the Government gives its support.It does not in any way affect the standing of the President.

      "Mr Chairman, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head M of the Estimates be reduced by $100\". Sir, let me start by commending the Ministry of Finance (MOF) for publishing the Occasional Paper on the Medium-Term Fiscal projections; and releasing it just before the Budget debate. This paper provides a useful forward view on the likely fiscal trends in the next decade, as we debate Budget 2023 and our longer-term positioning in the new era.It is clear from the Paper that both our operating and development expenditures are rising, and may rise sharply in the years ahead. We look set to be heading towards a recurring spending bill of about 20% of our GDP by 2030. The key drivers are expected: healthcare, wage subsidies, security and other social spending.We know that these spending, once introduced, can only grow bigger and are unlikely to be reversed. Cutting costs to balance a Budget is increasingly not a possible option. We need to expand and diversify our revenue sources, and hence, growing our economy and growing our reserves for the annuities to help fund the Budget is an imperative. While we cannot cut costs to greatness, we should do our level best to ensure public funds are well spent, spend effectively and are achieving the desired outcomes.Given this backdrop, I would like to hear from the Minister, how MOF intends to maintain fiscal sustainability, even as our spending needs continue grow? Sir, as our fiscal situation tightened up, it is even more important that MOF scrutinise and ensure that our spending is value-for-money, that cost avoidance procurement practices are adopted, and that we closely monitor and track the outcomes and key performance indexes (KPIs).In the Budget Statement debate, I expressed concerns about cost pressures faced by businesses and the need to step-up the overall productivity. Many companies transact and do businesses with the Government and the way the Government agencies conduct its operations, and the processes involved, can have a significant impact on cost to the businesses.While we must be digitally inclusive when dealing with individuals; especially the seniors, we can aim for greater digital pervasiveness when doing businesses with the enterprises. There must be continued obsession to improve processes and users' experience; whether through greater digital adoptions or process streamlining.In this regard, I would like to ask if MOF has any plans to make doing businesses with Government even more seamless, less time consuming and lower the costs? The Government is a major buyer of goods and services, and many SMEs and start-ups have innovative solutions and product offerings that can be of value to the Government. So, I would like to also ask, how can MOF and the public agencies better support and facilitate the growth of SMEs when they participate in Government procurements?Sir, Singapore is transiting to a low-carbon economy and the public sector has set itself a net-zero emissions target by around 2045. This is a laudable effort and a major undertaking for the Government. Can I ask the Ministry: how is MOF supporting the whole-of-Government in this effort?The Government and MOF can also play a significant role helping businesses build green capabilities and capture growth opportunities, given the buying power of the public sector. So, can I seek an update from Minister in this area?Sir, one other area that I hope that the Government can facilitate to do more is the development of the social sector. The Government can be a catalyst to spur more innovative social solutions and contribute to a stronger social compact. So may I ask the Minister: how is MOF is supporting the development of the social sector?And finally, in this Committee of Supply (COS), can I also seek an update on the various policy measures in place, to encourage philanthropy and volunteerism?Sir, as I have two more minutes, I just want to add my views to the discussion on the budgetary stance for Budget 2023. Earlier in the debate, Assoc Prof Jamus Lim commented that the fiscal stance for Budget 2023 is a contractionary one. I have a different view. The fact that we have a significant Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) contribution to our Budget every year, currently at 20% of our revenue, would mean that our Budget would necessarily be expansionary. Our expenditures are way higher than the taxes that we collect from the system. Hence, from that angle, our Budget will always be expansionary if we rely on NIRC to balance our books.Question proposed.Mr Chairman: Mr Leong Mun Wai, you can take your two cuts together please.\n",

      "Mr Chairman, I have questions for the Minister of Finance. Firstly, the termination payment for the Sports Hub was advanced from the Contingencies Fund and this House is now being asked to vote on replacing the amount in a Supplementary Supply Bill, how much is this termination payment? The Contingencies Fund was created for urgent and unforeseen expenditure. Was the termination payment for the Sports Hub so urgent, that it had to be advanced from the Contingencies Fund and not paid out of the Budget 2023?Secondly, where and when were the $900 million for SPH Media Trust be accounted for?Three, are there financial projections available, to determine the amount or transfer to the endowment and trust funds, and is the actual spending from the funds included in the Budget, in the year when the spending was made or is it off-balance sheet of the Budget?Fourth, when will the financial report on the $72 billion COVID-19 expenditure be completed?Fifth, based on what is given in the Budget, can the Minister confirm, what are the total financial assets as of 31 March 2022 and what is the net investment return (NIR) estimated for fiscal year 2023?Mr Chairman, the People's Action Party (PAP) Government and some of its MPs like to invoke the claim of raiding of the reserves to attack alternative policy ideas and proposals put up by the Opposition. In order to have a more productive debate in this House, it will be helpful to have an understanding of what constitutes \"raiding of reserves\". I would like to suggest two criteria to assess any new proposal that might affect the reserves.Firstly, the amount of expenditure required for the new proposal, relative to the size of the reserves and NIR. And secondly, the purpose of the expenditure, any proposal that passes these two criteria, where the amount involved is small relative to the reserves, or even the NIR, and serves an important purpose, should not be accused of raiding the reserves.Let me illustrate the two criteria using the Affordable Homes Scheme, which the Progress Singapore Party (PSP) recommended during the recent public housing Motion on 7 February 2023. During the debate, I explained that the Affordable Homes Scheme will only defer the accumulation of reserves, because the deferred land cost will be collected when the flat is sold in the future.And even if, the whole deferred land cost of about $3 billion per year is not collectable, it is only 6.4% of NIR and 12.8% of NIRC. We do not even need to use our reserves, so we have passed criteria one comfortably.For criteria two, the money is to be spent on an important and noble purpose, which is to make the Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat affordable and accessible for every Singaporean, of each generation. It will allow Singaporeans to retire comfortably, without having to sell his flat or downgrade. The financial security accorded is expected to unleash the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit in Singaporeans, and you would be able to better compete with the rest of the world. So, we also passed criteria two.Hence, based on the two criteria above, the affordable home scheme is an example of an alternative policy that does not constitute a raiding of reserves according to my definition. I hope to hear from the Minister what does she think. In the future, from my point of view, if the Government makes such accusations again, I will call them baseless allegations. Singaporeans deserve better for country, for people.\n",

      "Mr Chairman, my cut today refers to my exchange with Minister Indranee Rajah during the debate on the Carbon Pricing (Amendment) Bill.In the exchange, I was told the Presidential approval had not been obtained on my proposed amendments. I asked the Government when these amendments had been referred to the President to obtain the decision to which Minister Indranee Rajah made this reply and I am quoting a little from the longest speech she made in the interest of time, \"We determine that my amendments could not be supported, the reasons explained earlier by my colleagues and, as the amendments could not be supported, they will not put forward to the President for the President's recommendation.\"From this, it would seem that the exercise of the President's power to approve legislation that has fiscal implications has to be according to the Cabinet's advice. It would also seem that the Government can and does deem the President's approval to have been given or not given without necessarily referring the matter to the President.As I understand the statement, she did say that the President's approval or non-approval could be, to all practical intents and purposes, deemed to have been given by the Cabinet. And it did say that that particular matter had not been referred to the President.So, my questions here are two-fold.Firstly, in cases where the President has a constitutional duty to say \"yes\" or \"no\" to certain matters such as legislation with fiscal implications and when her decision can be deemed to have been given one way or the other by the Cabinet, is the matter referred to the President, the CPA and the other staff in the office of the President for at least discussion or information prior to the Cabinet's decision?And secondly, and much more importantly, what is the rationale for having such provisions in the Constitution whereby the Cabinet can deem the President to have said \"yes\" or \"no\" on certain matters and, hence, decide by itself?The role of the President in this regard does not seem to serve any check or balance function. What function then does it serve?One asks oneself what possible purpose could be served by such a procedural requirement baked into the Constitution. I can see no benefit to the body politic. In fact, I see a downside.Making it known that the President's approval is deemed by the Cabinet in certain domains as happened in November last year does not serve to enhance the prestige and standing of the Office of the President in the eyes of the public.In fact, to the contrary, this practice of \"deemed approval\" risks being seen by the public as involving the Office of President in a rubber-stamping or box-ticking exercise. It serves no constructive purpose and undermines the standing of the President. If there is no real reason for such provisions, will the Government do away with these provisions at some point in the future, given that there are no upsides but only downsides? Unless there are some upsides I cannot fathom right now and which the Government can explain.The Chairman: Mr Saktiandi Supaat, you can take both your cuts together.\n",

      "Mr Chairman, our success in weathering the recent COVID-19 pandemic came down largely to our ability to utilise our deep financial reserves, which have been accumulated by the Government who has spent public monies responsibly and prudently. In refining our checks on public spending, we must be cautious not to add further unnecessary or disproportionate bureaucracy as this will erode whatever savings we achieve from public procurement. For example, while I agree there is still room to invest in automated systems and training to eliminate human error, adding another one to two levels of approving authorities may be an inefficient and even ineffective solution.Whether under Emergency Procurement or normal procurement procedures, how does Ministry of Finance (MOF) ensure that public spending is scrutinised adequately to enable cost savings and what efforts are being undertaken to ensure prudent spending at all levels across the Government? How are larger projects, for example, like infrastructure spending being monitored?Mr Chairman, the public sector is a major buyer of goods and services. Set up in June 2000, GeBIZ was ahead of its time and was followed by many other e-procurement systems in other countries aimed at enhancing transparent competition and lowering the barriers for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to pitch for valuable Government contracts.  We should not rest on our laurels. How can GeBIZ be further augmented to help businesses save time and money in their transactions with Government agencies? For example, we can explore adding new features to integrate any industry briefings, tender briefings or site show-rounds with the relevant tender opportunities; and to engage with the procurement agency regarding any tender clarifications. Besides ensuring that the public sector obtains the best value-for-money, public procurement can serve the role of supporting the growth of promising SMEs and startups who have innovative solutions. In line with our strategy of supply diversification for resilience, can MOFâs \"value-for-money\" metric accommodate this aim? And what else can MOF doâ¯to help support the growth of promising SMEsâ¯through Government procurement?\n",

      "Mr Chairman, Sir, SMEs make up 99% of all businesses in Singapore's economy, employing nearly seven out of 10 workers and contributing close to half of our GDP. We should look for ways to further grow SMEs to large local enterprises (LLEs) to increase their scale and per capita contribution to our economy.Accordingly, I call upon MOF to facilitate more procurement opportunities for SMEs. What can MOF do to help support the growth of promising SMEs through Government procurements? In 2021, more than 80% of the procurement opportunities were open to SMEs. How can we further ensure that more such opportunities are made available for SMEs?Currently, a gap exists in contract value threshold for a request for quotations and tender. Also, can the Government review financial grading requirements for certain types of products and services to crowd source more innovative solutions? Some of these solutions can be provided by startups who may not meet the required financial grading due to the stage of their companies' growth. By doing so, the Government can tap on new innovations.An âin-betweenâ or middle ground can exist, where there is a âtender-lite systemâ which can provide SMEs and startups procure opportunities more readily. Tenders do take significant time and resources for SMEs and startups which translates to opportunity costs.In relation to the point on opportunity costs, can the Government streamline its processes to help businesses save time and money in their transactions with Government agencies? Can these digital solutions and innovations in turn encourage more efficient ways of doing business between companies and their suppliers and customers?Mr Chairman, Sir, increasing access to public sector contracts and reducing cost and time to transact with Government at the tender and operational stages can significantly help grow our SMEs and startups.\n",

      "Sir, like many in this House, I was cheered when Singapore brought forward its Singapore's NDCs to reach net zero by 2050, and for the public sector to achieve net-zero emissions by around 2045.  This is a significant commitment and a non-trivial one to achieve, especially in the midst of an energy crisis. Many decarbonisation technologies are already ready today, but the speed of rollout depends on various other factors like infrastructure upgrades, business model and regulatory changes. EVs come to mind here. While other decarbonisation technologies, especially in hard to abate sectors of the economy, are not yet available at scale today. Until technologies like green hydrogen or CCUS become cost competitive versus carbon intensive alternatives, it will be difficult to mobilise the capital needed to scale and bring them down the cost curve over time. Governments must play their part to incentivise the flow of investment into these climate solutions, and the transition to these solutions given their cost disadvantage. By giving incentives to reduce the âgreen premiumâ, and through innovative risk sharing and financing structures, including public-private partnerships, Government can be the catalyst for a faster transition. Some governments have made bolder policy moves. The US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of August 2022 has been billed as the largest piece of federal legislation to address climate change. Investing $391 billion in provisions related to energy security and climate change, including tax incentives and a green bank. The tax credits of $3 per kg of hydrogen is particularly notable, turning the US into one of the cheapest countries in the world to produce green hydrogen.  In Singapore the Government has many fiscal and non-tax levers to drive the transition which it has used, such as carbon tax, and funding for research. Given recent developments, can the Minister provide an update on how MOF is supporting the transition to net zero?\n",

      "Chairman, we anticipate a tighter fiscal space in the coming years. There is scope for wealthy families, businesses and individuals to contribute meaningfully through philanthropy to our rising needs. Unlike a conventional system that relies heavily on taxation and redistribution, philanthropy offers the added benefit of strengthening our social compact.  The number of wealth owners and family offices in Singapore continues to grow at a healthy rate. Many of them have expressed interest to give back to society, both in Singapore and regionally. The Philanthropy Tax Incentive Scheme announced in Budget 2023 for Family Offices is another important step to facilitate philanthropy and to meet Singaporeâs ambition to be Asia's philanthropic hub.   As we encourage philanthropy to continue to grow, it is important to ask what types of philanthropy will have the greatest impact on Singapore.  Prof Rob Reich of Stanford University has argued that philanthropy has a special role in discovery and experimentation, serving as societyâs \"risk capital\" to foster innovation in important areas that deemed to carry too much risk for Government or private sector appetites.   As such, philanthropy can be catalytic and complementary to public funding â it can identify and support high-impact opportunities that are in its early stage. When the solutions are proven, philanthropists can partner with the public sector to scale them up.   It is also important to identify the most pressing areas of need where philanthropy can have the greatest impact. Take climate change as an example â it is an existential imperative, and the negative effects of climate change will also exacerbate other areas of need, such as global health and pandemics, inequality and displacement of communities.   As a recent McKinsey climate philanthropy report has noted, philanthropists possess both resources and expertise to support climate mitigation and adaptation solutions, especially in areas that may lack market support.    They can quickly deploy unrestricted funds in response to urgent problems such as natural disasters, back high-risk ventures, convene stakeholders and promote collaboration, develop and share research, and support large-scale implementation of climate solutions. So, I want to ask how can the Government foster support and public-private partnerships, both in Singapore and overseas, for such philanthropic causes, to address some of societyâs most pressing challenges and issues? In promoting philanthropy, we must also consider policies across the continuum of doing good, which is wide-ranging and can include venture philanthropy, concessionary capital and impact investing â a broad range continuum.  Many wealth owners, especially those in the next generation, are looking towards these newer and more innovative approaches, sometimes referred to as âmoon-shotâ philanthropy.   So, we must also recognise that beyond grant making, there are other ways to give back such as volunteerism and the contribution of skills and networks. As the Government develops more initiatives and policies to promote philanthropy, how can it promote more diverse ways of doing good?The Chairman: Senior Minister of State Chee Hong Tat.\n",

      "Mr Chairman, I thank Members for their questions and suggestions.Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked how the Government ensures fiscal sustainability and spend prudently within our means. Besides the audits by the Auditor-Generalâs Office and our internal auditors, MOF conducts regular reviews of Ministriesâ budgets to identify areas for improvement and ensures every Ministry uses its allocated resources efficiently and effectively.Singaporeâs overall performance has been good, with current Government expenditure being around 18% of GDP. Even as our expenditures grow further and exceed 20% of GDP by 2030, our Government expenditure as a percentage of GDP is significantly lower than most developed countries. At the same time, we are able to achieve positive economic and social outcomes for Singapore and Singaporeans.  One example is how we reduce the costs of major Government infrastructure projects by applying a stringent cost-effectiveness evaluation together with experts from the private sector and academia. In 2022, we achieved total cost avoidance of around $1 billion through this process. This $1 billion saved means we can put it to good use and meet our spending needs in other areas.The Government also looks out for other forms of savings by integrating different projects to maximise the synergies. For example, the upcoming East Coast Integrated Depot, which incorporates three MRT depots and one bus depot, saved about 44 hectares of land. This is twice the land size of Changi Airportâs Terminal 4 or equivalent to approximately 60 football fields.  Another example is VITALâs Demand Aggregation contracts for common buys such as office supplies, catering and courier services. These saved the Government more than $50 million per annum. This approach also reduces the need for agencies to call separate tenders and quotations, saving at least 100,000 man-hours a year.  Sir, Mr Liang, Mr Edward Chia, Ms Mariam Jafaar and Mr Saktiandi asked how MOF helps businesses to reduce costs and build capabilities for growth. The Government will continue to implement pro-business policies and measures and provide an environment that enables them to grow and succeed. Besides supporting businesses through our economic agencies and via a comprehensive suite of grants and incentives for innovation, productivity improvements and skills-upgrading, there are two additional areas where MOFâs work benefit our companies. First, by simplifying Government rules and processes, we enable businesses to save time and money when they transact with Government. Second, by helping businesses build capabilities to enhance their competitiveness and access new opportunities, both locally and abroad.Let me share some examples.We recently launched eGuarantee@Gov, a simple and secure digital process for businesses and individuals to provide a bankerâs guarantee or insurance bond to Government agencies. Businesses can apply for an eGuarantee from over 20 participating financial institutions online for direct submission to Government agencies within a day. With eGuarantee@Gov, there is no longer a need to visit a bank to purchase a physical copy of the guarantee or to pay for courier services to deliver it. The new arrangement is quicker, better and cheaper. We expect up to 4,000 eGuarantees to be lodged in 2023, resulting in overall savings for all stakeholders of about $500,000 per year. There is also scope in the future for eGuarantees to extend to commercial transactions between businesses and their suppliers and customers. MOF and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) will work with the financial institutions and trade association and chambers to encourage adoption of eGuarantees for such transactions. Just as the use of PayNow for digital payments has allowed businesses and individuals to enjoy lower transaction costs and time savings compared to the traditional method of using cheques, the adoption of eGuarantees can bring about benefits compared to the current method of providing physical bank guarantees.Next, MOF removed the requirement for businesses with annual turnover of less than $5 million to submit audited accounts when applying for Government Supplier Registration. This benefits about 2,400 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) annually, with estimated cost savings of around $4.5 million per year. MOF continually makes improvements to GeBIZ, the Government-wide procurement system. For instance, about 3,000 businesses can benefit from the Supplier File Repository by the end of this year. Businesses no longer need to submit the same financial statements and company profile when responding to different Government quotations and tenders. We will also consider the features that Mr Saktiandi mentioned for future improvements.Sir, another example is Inland Revenue Authority of Singaporeâs (IRAS) initiative to encourage businesses to use seamless filing software. Such software provides many productivity benefits for businesses, as they can automatically generate and file their corporate income tax computations and returns. This process takes only 15 minutes compared to the estimated eight hours required for manual preparation and submission.Moving on to the next area of how MOF supports businesses to develop capabilities for growth. We will continue to simplify our processes for suppliers, including SMEs, to participate in Government tenders while maintaining a level-playing field for all businesses and achieving value-for-money procurement outcomes. For procurement below $90,000, financial track record is not required. The terms and conditions are also simplified. For example, there is no requirement to provide security deposits. SMEs participate actively in our Government contracts and about 80% of these are awarded to SMEs annually. Winning Government contracts gives SMEs the opportunity to build up their track records, develop capabilities and capacity to tap into new growth areas. To further improve the access of SMEs to business opportunities through Government tenders, MOF will introduce a new category of tender by the end of 2023 called âTender Liteâ, which comes with fewer and simpler conditions. Tender Lite will allow more suppliers to participate in tenders with value higher than $90,000 but below $1 million and is estimated to cover over 70% of all Government tenders that are currently awarded to SMEs.MOF will work with representatives from Singapore Business Federation and the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises, as well as Government agencies on the design of Tender Lite. We believe this approach of Government and industry working together as partners will bring about win-win outcomes and allow us to move faster and innovate new solutions more effectively. My colleagues and I are keen to continue the partnership with our industry partners beyond Tender Lite and extend the collaboration to other subsequent areas of work that will benefit our businesses.Members such as Mr Derrick Goh have highlighted during the Budget debate that Government can help prepare SMEs for new requirements and opportunities in environmental sustainability. We agree. The public sector is supporting our suppliersâ efforts to adopt greener practices which are increasingly in demand by other major buyers. Over the years, the Government has incorporated environmental sustainability requirements into our procurement such as requiring information and communication technology (ICT) equipment and air conditioners to meet energy efficiency standards. Our target is to include environmental sustainability requirements and evaluation criteria into all Government procurement within the next five years, in a manner that keeps pace with industry readiness and international developments. Starting from FY2024, for tenders of construction projects and ICT projects with minimum estimated procurement value of $50 million and $10 million respectively, we will set aside up to 5% of the evaluation points for sustainability-related considerations. The Government will further engage the industry stakeholders on the details of these measures. Another capability that is increasingly sought after is sustainability reporting. Businesses that can provide good sustainability-related information can gain competitive advantage, expand into markets and potentially access cheaper funds through green financing.To drive sustainability reporting efforts for the industry, Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) and the Singapore Exchange Regulation established the Sustainability Reporting Advisory Committee in June 2022. The Committee will embark on its public consultations later this year.Businesses also need to accelerate their pace of digitalisation, a point which Mr Liang made. The Government will implement InvoiceNow as the default e-invoice submission channel for all Government vendors within the next few years. Using InvoiceNow will help businesses improve efficiency and reduce cost, by eliminating the need for manual processing and it also reduces errors. Businesses transacting on InvoiceNow can save $8 per invoice compared to the manual process. InvoiceNow also facilitates the direct transmission of invoices in a structured and standardised digital format that is accepted internationally across finance systems, and this helps businesses access overseas markets more easily. Today, about 55,000 businesses have adopted InvoiceNow, supported by 200 service providers. I encourage more businesses to come on board.Sir, Mr Liang and Ms Foo Mee Har asked how MOF will support and encourage more philanthropy and volunteerism from corporations and the community. Philanthropy and volunteerism are key elements for building a strong social compact. There is something intangible and different in how we build up the character of our society, when people go beyond what they are required to contribute under our fair and progressive tax and benefits system, where everyone contributes something and those who are better off contribute more. Many Singaporeans and also foreigners and companies who are based here, have an interest in philanthropy and are keen to help others in society. We have been strengthening our ecosystem to encourage their contributions and participation to maximise the positive impact to our local communities. This is a good way to keep our society cohesive and strengthen our solidarity as one united people. Not only through taxation and redistribution which are done through policies and laws but also through philanthropy and volunteerism which come from willing hands and loving hearts.  MOF provides funding support for many community and ground-up programmes which contribute to the development of the social sector. There are many existing efforts by agencies working with intermediaries like the Community Foundation of Singapore and ComChest, as well as beneficiaries to link up donors with suitable charitable causes. I have also met wonderful people such as those from Utama and Majurity Trust, who started initiatives to help raise donations from high net worth individuals and corporations to fund worthy social causes like caring for vulnerable seniors and providing opportunities for children from lower-income families.  The Government provides broad-based support in the form of 250% tax deductions for qualifying donations to Institutions of a Public Character (IPCs) and the Corporate Volunteer Scheme (CVS) supports volunteerism efforts by businesses in IPCs. The Government also provides matching grants to encourage charitable giving. For example, we allocated a top-up of $100 million to the Tote Boardâs Enhanced Fundraising Programme which in turn provides dollar-for-dollar matching on eligible donations received by charities.Sir, to build stronger social resilience, the Government will continue to encourage our community especially those who have done well to engage in sustained giving and volunteerism. Through such efforts, we will strengthen our social compact and build a more caring and inclusive Singapore. This will then provide the social cohesion and stability for us to pursue pro-growth policies and enlarge our economic pie, generate more opportunities and provide more resources that we can then use to invest in our collective future and support the vulnerable amongst us.In this way, we can strengthen our social compact and grow our economy at the same time. The two objectives will reinforce and support each other, allowing us to move forward while staying together. The Chairman: Minister Indranee Rajah. \n",

      "Mr Chairman, I will be responding to the cuts filed by Mr Leon Perera and Mr Leong Mun Wai. Mr Leon Perera asked about the processes for obtaining the Presidentâs recommendation to move a Bill, or amendments to a Bill tabled in Parliament. Mr Chairman, under Article 59(2) of the Constitution, Bills or amendments with financial implications cannot be introduced or moved in this House without the Presidentâs recommendation. This mechanism ensures that the Government of the day has the sole right and responsibility to initiate financial legislation and therefore financial legislation cannot proceed without the Governmentâs support.It is very important to understand in this context, that for the purposes of Article 59(2), when the President gives his or her recommendation, it is upon the advice of the Government and not at the discretion of the President.If the recommendation is provided, then it shows that the legislation or amendment has the Government's support. This is different from the other provisions of the Constitution where the President acts upon his or her discretion, for example, in relation to draws on past reserves or the appointment of certain key appointment holders.Where the requirement in Article 59(2) is triggered and the Government does not support the Bill or amendment, there is no need to seek or to advise the President not to provide the recommendation. It is sufficient to inform the House that the Bill or amendment does not have the President's recommendation in accordance with the Standing Orders. Where the Government supports the Bill or the amendment, the Government will seek the recommendation of the President and formally advise the President to provide such recommendation.This requirement for Government support before financial legislation can be passed is a standard arrangement of many Commonwealth parliamentary democracies, although the mechanisms may vary.In Singapore, it is done through the mechanism of the President's recommendation, as I have explained. In New Zealand, where a Bill or amendment \"would have more than a minor impact on the Government's fiscal aggregates if it became law\", the government may issue a \"Financial veto certificate\" to state that it does not concur with the Bill or amendment, in which event, such Bill or amendment cannot be passed. In Canada, this is done by requiring the royal recommendation, which may only be obtained by a Minister, to be conveyed to Parliament.While the mechanisms may vary from country to country, the principle underpinning them is the same. That is to say, a Bill or an amendment with financial implications cannot be passed if the government of the day does not support it, in recognition of the principle that responsibility for financial matters lies with the Government. So, earlier, when Mr Leon Perera talked about \"deeming\", there is no \"deeming\" involved. If the Government does not support the Bill or the amendment, the Government would not even need to put it to the President. But if the Government supports it, then the Government will put it to the President with the requisite advice and the recommendation would be signified in Parliament. Hence, the Council of Presidential Advisers (CPA) is also not engaged because this is not a discretionary function of the President. The President may consult the CPA for the discretionary functions.For a Government Bill falling within the scope of Article 59(2), the Minister giving notice of the introduction of the Bill must indicate whether the President's recommendation is required and when introducing the Bill at First Reading, must signify whether the recommendation has been obtained. This is provided for in Standing Order 67(1).Members may recall that a few days ago, I introduced the Supply Bill. When I introduced the Supply Bill, I signified to the Chamber that I had the President's recommendation.In the case of a private Member's Bill, the Minister for Finance has to inform the Speaker whether the President's recommendation is required under Article 59(2). If the Minister for Finance informs the Speaker that the President's recommendation is in fact required, then, before the Member can be called upon to move the Motion seeking leave to introduce this Bill under Standing Order 66(1), a Cabinet Minister must signify to Parliament whether the President's recommendation has been obtained.If no such recommendation has been obtained, the Speaker shall not allow the Motion for leave to introduce the Bill to be moved. The same procedure applies to amendments proposed to Bills. That is under Standing Order 74(3)(c). One more thing I should add, which is that if a Member intends to propose a Bill or amendments to a Bill, which make provision directly or indirectly for the list of financial matters listed in Article 59(2), he or she should inform the Ministry or Minister with oversight of the matters in the Bill or amendment as soon as possible and ideally no later than the time of filing the relevant notices with Parliament so that the relevant assessments and steps can be taken. If the Member is not sure whether the matters in the Bill or amendment are caught by the provisions of Article 59(2), then all the more so it would be advisable to inform the relevant Ministry or Minister early. That deals with Mr Perera's cut. I move on to Mr Leong Mun Wai's cuts.Sir, Mr Leong Mun Wai had a series of, I think, five questions. Mr Leong did not provide the indication of these beforehand. Normally in the gist of the Budget cuts, Members are asked to provide the gist. I also do send out a notice, generally, to ask people to provide the gist of their cuts because it will then enable us to respond in a more considered or fuller manner. With respect to the five questions which basically were given on the spot, I will give such replies as I can. If the Member has any other things, it will have to be taken up separately. Let me just run through very quickly.I think the first question was on the termination of the Sports Hub. I would say in response the reason for the termination of the Sports Hub was addressed in the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY)'s Ministerial Statement in August 2022.The reasons for the urgency and the use of the Contingency Fund was: first, the transaction was market sensitive; and second, it was an opportune time to develop the Kallang Alive precinct as the sports sector recovered from COVID-19. The termination sum will be paid in this financial year.For his second question on the SPH Media Trust, that is from the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI)'s annual budget from FY2022 to FY2026. However, no money has been disbursed as Minister Josephine Teo had said in Parliament. For his third question, disbursement figures from the Government statutory funds are in the Government Financial Statements. The disbursement figures for the funds under the Statutory Boards are included in their financial statements.For his fourth question, the audit of the full $72.3 billion will be completed by the end of FY2024. This was answered earlier this month by Senior Minister of State Chee in a response to a Parliamentary Question.For the fifth question, I think the answers there can be found in the Budget Book.Then, with regard to his last point about what is the definition of \"raiding the reserves\", Mr Chairman, it is not a term of art. Essentially, we have a framework on how the reserves are to be used. When the principal amount is taken or drawn down or when land is alienated and if it is not made good or put back, that is a draw on the reserves.It is a simple principle that we adhere to. The framework is clear. It is not necessary for me to go into a definitional argument. The reasons and the rationale of when you can have a draw on the reserves are clear. A pandemic would be a good reason â when you are facing potential catastrophe and you have to save the economy, you have to save people. That is something that is built into the current framework. The reserves can only be used with the agreement of the President.The Chairman: Mr Leong Mun Wai.\n",

      "Mr Leong Mun Wai\n",

      "Chairman, I thank the Minister for the reply. I have three questions. One is that given the kind of payments like the Sports Hub and also SPH Media Trust, where is a big payment to a third party, what is the procedure whereby the Parliament can come in and have oversight over such expenditure? Meaning, how far can the Government just approve the expenditure, just like that?For example, now, we have this SINGA Bill where infrastructural projects that are more than $4 billion require â when it goes through the SINGA Bill, then it comes to Parliament. But does it mean that if in the future, there is a project where we need to terminate the project and it is a $4 billion payout, the Government just makes the decision like that without Parliament scrutinising the numbers? That is one question.The second question is, to your best knowledge as the Second Minister for Finance, what is the percentage of the endowment funds that are being paid out every year â as a percentage of the outstanding assets that these endowment funds have at the moment? The third question, with regards to the raiding of reserves. Your question basically means â does it mean that as long as the Government has a set of rules, we cannot debate against that set of rules? In this case, it is a set of rules regarding reserves management and the recording of the reserves. You can always say that what you have proposed is not in line with our reserve management policies but we can still discuss about it. There is no need to say right from the beginning, that this is a raiding the reserves and it is not only one time, but many many times by many people and over the mass media and all that.The Chairman: Could we keep it concise so that others can ask their clarifications?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That is my third question. Okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms Indranee Rajah\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I thank the Member for his clarifications. I think his first question is related to what authority does the Government have and what is the relationship with Parliament and the degree of oversight. I should start off with the first premise, which is that when the people elect the Government, it is to govern. It is to run the Government. Therefore, there are quite a large scope of things which is under the authority of the Government.The Government, obviously, has to be accountable. Hence, when the Government is accountable, it has to come back to Parliament for various things. But when it comes to Parliament, it is usually to scrutinise broad policy and not the day-to-day operational matters.So, the debate that we just had, for example, the Budget debate we call it the Budget debate but actually, people forget what it actually is. It is a Motion to ask this House to approve the Government's financial policy. You approve the financial policy, all those broad headings and the broad expenditure that is agreed to by Parliament, but the details of how that is to be spent if it is within the block budget, that is really within the Ministries' purview.But if it is thought, for example, that the Ministry has not done well in its expenditure, that can be queried in Parliament either through Parliamentary Questions, and we also have the Estimates Committee, which is a standing Parliamentary Select Committee which examines the Government's Budget and raises questions thereon. I think that is available to the Member as well. So, we have a whole series of checks and balances. You have got the Constitution, which sets the framework. The fiscal policy or financial policy is subject to Parliamentary approval and subject to debate. We have got the Estimates Committee. There is also the Public Accounts Committee. It is also subject to independent audits by the Auditor-General's Office (AGO). The Public Accounts Committee also examines the Government's accounts and the AGO's report and calls on the relevant agencies to explain particular issues or to take corrective actions.For the second question on the extent of funds paid out every year, since that is a very specific question requiring certain data, perhaps the Member can file a question on that. I do not have that offhand.The third question was, I think the Member put it this way â he said does it mean that if the Government has a set of rules, we cannot debate it because he said we can always say it is not in line. He also said that there was no need to say that it is raiding one time but all the time. Let me deal with the two separately.The first one â does it mean that we have a set of rules? The answer is yes. We do have a set of rules. Does it mean that you cannot debate the rules? No. If you want to change the reserves framework, by all means, you can debate that. You can suggest that it should be changed. But so long as the rules are in place and so long as what is proposed is not in conformance with those rules and is a draw on the reserves, then it means that it falls outside or breaches, if you like, or it is not in accordance with the rules.So, there are two things. You have a set of rules. And if you want to debate whether that should or should not be the rule, that is entirely up to that Member's prerogative. But if what you happen to be proposing does not fall within the rules, then the Government is entitled to say that it would be a draw or, put it in a slightly easier to understand form, it will be a raid on the reserves.And secondly, Mr Leong suggested that there is no need to say raiding the reserves, not one time but many, many times. The answer is that, if your proposals do actually intend to draw down the reserves not one time but many, many times, then, inevitably, it will draw the reaction that you are raiding not one time but many, many times. So, it all depends on your proposal. The Chairman: Mr Liang Eng Hwa.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sorry, Mr Chairman, I just wanted to clarify something to make sure I was absolutely accurate in my answer to Mr Leon Perera earlier, about when the President consults the Council of Presidential Advisors (CPA). I just wanted to clarify that the President must consult the Council before exercising any discretionary power, unless it is one of the excluded matters in Article 37I(A)2, that she only needed to consult in some situations.The Chairman: Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Chairman, I thank Mr Perera for his clarification. But actually, this procedure is a very long-standing procedure, not just ours, but it is a feature of the Westminster model and parliamentary democracies.In other words, these procedures, you may call it elaborate. It is a polite way of coming to Parliament to say that you need the Government's support. Many of the things which have its roots in parliamentary procedure from the Westminster model come from these â you could say, these courtesies of the past. The New Zealanders, as I described, are a little bit more direct about it. It is just a government \"veto certificate\". \"Nope\" and that is it. But we are doing it in a polite way. We signify whether the President has given her recommendation. Whether or not the President gives her recommendation, would depend on whether or not the Government gives its support.It does not in any way affect the standing of the President. It was a very early feature of our Constitution. And you will find it, if you check, you will find it in many different ways, shapes or forms in other Commonwealth jurisdictions.And so, it is not so much a question of box-ticking, certainly not the case. It is very much a case of observing certain proprieties which are laid out and, in a way, that has a long-standing tradition.The Chairman: Very quick one. Mr Saktiandi. We have to end it by .\n",

      "Sir, just want to come back to the question I raised in my cut which is whether the Government can do more to review our rules and procedures so that we can be more pro-business and help businesses save cost and save time.I often hear this feedback from the businesses. The pain point is always that the Government rules can be quite cumbersome and some are unnecessary and the procedures can be quite inefficient. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State again if the Government can do more here. \n",

      "My point was that our expenditures are way higher than the taxes that we collected from the system. In that regard, it is expansionary because we are spending more than that we collect from the taxes.

      "Mr Chairman, I thank Mr Liang for asking this very important question. The Government deals with quite a lot of businesses: in our capacity as regulator, when they are applying for licence, they need our permit to operate; or as a buyer, when we procure services and then they are our suppliers.In both instances, there is scope for us to continue to look for ways in which we can do better in our interactions with businesses especially smaller businesses, the SMEs, because they do not have a lot of resources. So, when we design our licensing framework, when we design our rules and procedures, we also want to make sure that they are able to comply with not too much difficulty.Sir, I want to highlight that this is not just an MOF effort. This is actually a whole-of-Government effort. And my colleagues from the other Government Ministries and agencies, have also been embarking on this initiative. One of the initiatives, Mr Liang is aware, is the Pro-Enterprise Panel under the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) where we regularly solicit feedback from businesses and from trade associations on where are some of the pain points and where are some of the areas for improvement.I recall, a few years ago, when I was with MTI, I shared an example of how we used business process, re-engineering and digital transformation to implement Go-Business licensing portal where we shortened the processing time for food-related businesses when they applied for licenses by up to 14 days and we cut down the number of forms that they need to submit. Previously, I think it was 14 altogether, more than 800 data fields. We did some consolidation and we reduced it to one form with fewer than 90 data fields, and we removed some of the duplicate licences and helped them to save on licensing fees. When you remove some of these, then they do not have to apply, do not have to pay.This is something we want to keep doing and it has to be a partnership with our businesses and our trade associations, because the Government may not know fully where are all the pain points and where are all the areas for improvement. But from the users' point of view, the businesses will know. That is why I mentioned in my speech earlier that I want to work closely with SBF and ASME, not just to improve on the tender processes by introducing Tender Lite, which is one of the ways to help businesses, but also on other pro-business initiatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Chairman, the current payment term for the Government to pay our suppliers is within 30 days. And this is a standard that I would say, is comparable, if not, better than some of the other governments and even private sector companies. But we will want to work towards, where possible, to shorten the payment period. Because, as the Member correctly pointed out, this will directly benefit our SMEs in terms of cashflow.I would want to caveat that a little bit by saying that it depends really on the nature of the contract. There are some that are more straightforward â the service has been provided, the product has been delivered, everything is okay, we can try and speed it up. But there are some that may require more evaluation because it is not so straightforward, or if the amounts are much bigger and we need to be careful, with due diligence, in order to ensure value for money and prudent spending.Rather than to have sort of a blanket yes or no, we will certainly aim to work towards where we can â for simpler, more straightforward contracts, smaller amounts, we try our best to go within 14 days. But larger amounts, more complex contracts, we may need to give the agencies a bit more time so that they also can safeguard the interests of public funds.The Chairman: Mr Leon Perera.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Chairman, Mr Saktiandi raised an important point because we do not just focus on the large ticket items. Those are very important, because, as I mentioned in my speech earlier, we managed to save $1 billion dollars through the process together with experts from private sector and academia.But many of the smaller projects on their own, may not yield a lot of savings. But if you add them all up and there are many of them, could make a positive impact on our overall value-for -money outcome.So, we have been encouraging the Ministries and âThe Chairman: You can just quickly wrap up.\n",

      "â agencies to empower the officers. What we want to do is continue this process of working closely with them, letting our officers know that when you bring up such suggestions, you will be supported. We will facilitate experimentation, trying out some of these new ideas. And even if some of them were to fail along the way, because we are doing some pilots and it is not guaranteed that all of these would succeed, it is okay. It is okay to try because we are all working towards a better outcome.The Chairman: It is okay. Thank you. Mr Liang Eng Hwa, would you like to withdraw your amendment?\n",

      "Thank you, Chair. The hon Member Mr Liang had suggested earlier on and, if I heard correctly, that so long as we have a positive NIRC, then the Budget must necessarily be expansionary.May I first clarify that that was indeed what he said.And, if so, since the NIRC has been consistently positive, at least since 2008, would that mean that he believes that over the past decade and a half, that we have never run a contractionary fiscal stance? And I am wondering if the Minister of Finance or anyone from the Finance Ministry is willing to corroborate this characterisation.If what the Member meant was, so long as the sum of the NIRC and revenue is less than expenditure, then it is expansionary. I actually have no quarrel with that. But since the NIRC has, in fact, been positive, this would actually mean an even greater surplus over expenditure, which would mean an even more contractionary budget, contrary to an expansionary one.The Chairman: Mr Liang.\n",

      "Thank you, Chair. I have two clarifications for Senior Minister of State Chee, not on philanthropy because the question roughly is answered, but two clarifications regarding a debate brought up here.First, Senior Minister of State spoke about Government's effort to support businesses, especially SMEs. So, how we pay them is going to be important. I would like to ask, this has been brought up in previous speeches, what is Government's plan to try and pay the businesses transacts within 14 days? Is that achievable, that request from Nominated Member of Parliament Ms Janet Ang?The second clarification is, what is the targeted adoption rate for e-invoice for transaction with Government? The Senior Minister of State spoke about that just now. I want to ask what happens if some SMEs have not put in place the necessary infrastructure? Does that mean they cannot participate in Government procurement?\n",

      "Thank you, Mr Chairman. I would like to thank Minister Indranee Rajah for her reply to my cut.I just have one clarification, and I appreciate her laying out the process for seeking the President's recommendation on Bills, with fiscal implications as well as speaking about areas of exercisable discretion and so on. Those points are well taken.My clarification is just about why there is a need to have this rather curious and complicated procedure, where for these matters, something is referred to the President, but then, the Cabinet instructs the President to act in a very prescriptive way and President has to act that way and then the Bill can move forward in Parliament.It does not seem to serve any constructive purpose, in terms of time and the administrative effort and efficiency. And moreover, would the Minister give some thought to the consideration I raised? There is a potential disamenity in keeping such arrangements in place which is that of the President being seen to be a part of this sort of procedure which involves box-ticking or rubber stamping. It could be seen that way. It does not really help the standing of the Office of the President and just seems unnecessary.Will the Government consider reforming this aspect of the Constitution to sort of do away with that procedural step. And before I resume my seat, I just want to say that it should be clear that we have debated in this Chamber before on the Workers' Party's position on the Presidency âThe Chairman: If you could keep it short on this point. \n",

      "Thank you, Mr Chairman. I am just glad that we are discussing today about cost savings when our neighbour just released their budget and they are talking about cutting their deficits and reducing the government debt.My question is to Senior Minister of State Chee, in response to his answer to my cards. In regard to the scrutiny of infrastructure spending, he answered that question in terms of public accounts. But, maybe, if Senior of Minister of State can share a bit more about our cost savings and our efforts from smaller projects, smaller to medium-term projects, and what additional sort of scrutiny and efforts to review those and how we can enhance on that front as well.\n",
